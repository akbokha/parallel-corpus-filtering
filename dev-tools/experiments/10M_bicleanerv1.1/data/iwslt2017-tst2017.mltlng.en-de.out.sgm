<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">They might know him, because he won the Pulitzer Prize as New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before someone had heard by Edward Snowden, he wrote a book in which he had spectacular that the NSA illegally heard by Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But there is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In it he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation in which the CIA was literally transferred to Iran's atomic bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If the crazy sounds, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who did not feel the chapter?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years, the government has been determined and asked him to call his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this train, he became a symbol of the government of the government to condemn Whistres and journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the First Constitutional Court, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right if media do not receive this information and protect the identity of the Muzzle that they give.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government of Risen, he did something that many courageous reporters were made before him: he refused and said that he would prefer to go into prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk to go into prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the process, something unusual.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, although they have been working for years, it is indispensable for their case, the requirements of the government were dropped on raisen.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in time of electronic monitoring the reporters and sources can still hide themselves less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rather than to be ashamed and to bring down statements, this also could do its digital footsteps for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And thus, the investigator, without his understanding, concerned his telephone calls at home,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like its e-mail data, financial and banking information, its lending information, and even travel information with the list of its flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the middle of these information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA-Whistoried and crack.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sorry, this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama spoke with his appeal to protect wounds. but instead, the judiciary has more condemned to him than all US governments before him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how that a problem can be, especially because the government is too much of her work as secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article about national security was the result of that a Whistorians went to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">Thus, we put the press work on the game that should be protected by the first constitutional complaint, because the government has more possibilities to assemble all.</seg>
<seg id="28">However, as technology of the government permits to handle the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to protect their sources better.</seg>
<seg id="29">Although they can contact them from the moment, in which they contact contact, instead of the afternoon, in the testimony.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today, there is communication software that had not yet been writing as a raisen, and it is much more secure than normal e-mails or telephone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such a technology is SecureDrop, an open source translation system for Whistories, which was originally developed by us by us Swartz, and is now been developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation in which I have been working.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of send an e-mail, go to a news site, such as the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can instantly upload documents or send documents, as in every usual contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These will then be encrypted and saved on a server, to which only the relevant news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government cannot address more information secretly, and many of the information that would like it would be not available from beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments develop and develop new spy technologies for all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="38">It's not to ensure that only technology separator like Edward Snowden have a way to bring iniquities. it is as important that we protect the next Whistres,</seg>
<seg id="39">The over abuse during the supply of soldiers who knows and reported of overcrowded hospitals. or the next environmental workers, the alarm to the sighed water of Flint. or a Wallstreet Insider, warned us before the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">After all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to cover the crimes, but to protect our all constitutional rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on 3 April 2016, the biggest data streams of the story was published.] [what does this week we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness to a statement.] this week we asked news about a cheque of 11 million documents in Panama-based law firm Mosque Fonseca</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of the tax-phases.</seg>
<seg id="44">We will get an impression of how customer, banks and lawyers to companies such as Mossack Fonseca and say: "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you judge that?"</seg>
<seg id="45">In fact, we see the e-mails, as it works as the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">The Islands Prime Minister is resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There is also reports that a ban on the brutal Syrian dictator Baschar al-Assad withered companies in tax phases.</seg>
<seg id="49">It claims that a track of $2 billion is going to Russian President Vladimir Putin, a narrow friend of children's days, a famous Cellists.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of rich people and others that wait nervous to the next publication, and to the next unveil documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now sounds like the plot of a agencies or a John-Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems weeping far from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should it be?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax bunnies and not all their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as health, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these discovers are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">In all over the world, media and leading politicians, such as secret tax bunnies of some few are used to hide and swallowed up -- something that we have been discussing for ten years and unveil.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people will seem very confusing this whole world, and it's hard to understand how these tax bunnies work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always present myself like a Matrjoinkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">So one has a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to understand what's behind this prayer.</seg>
<seg id="61">It may be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities, as well as journalists or civil society really to understand what thing is.</seg>
<seg id="62">I also find it interesting that there is fewer reports about this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">Probably because there were no prominent Americans that were present in these abstentions, this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not so that there is no enough Americans to hide their assets in tax bunnies.</seg>
<seg id="65">But by the principle of principle, after which these control bunnies work, Mossack Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">We would have a bit of data from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would have much more cases and examples that have connections to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, it is so that one needs to give less information in some US states to obtain a company than to get a library license.</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of the intransparent in the United States has to be admitted to school children, school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It is possible to allow especially vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this type of behaviour that affects us.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to figure out how all this looks like in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a hidden investigation into the offices of 13 offices in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator gave himself as African ministers to bring the suspicious money to the USA to buy a house, a yacht to buy a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">It really shocked that all of them went to a lawyer at our investigator proposals, how he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">These were all prematchings. none of these lawyers attended us as clients, and of course there was no one to any money. however, it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as a result.</seg>
<seg id="78">It does not go about a single lawyer who has underlying investigator suggestions.</seg>
<seg id="79">It is not responsible for a single polarity, wound in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">It is about how the system works, through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to handle this, we have to change the rules.</seg>
<seg id="82">We must change the rules to make this type of behavior.</seg>
<seg id="83">This may seem very good thing, as if we could do nothing against it; as if there is nothing ever changed, it is always the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a born optimist, I really see that a lot has started to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the last few years we have seen inventories to more transparency, regarding the owners of companies.</seg>
<seg id="86">The theme found political attention through British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then the EU has been recorded in central registers at national level, who is really behind companies in Europe, and who controls them.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the USA remains behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have brought a bill in the two parliamentarians, but this makes not the progress which we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We really would like to see how these Panama abstentions, this huge insight into the world of control bunnies, as a means used to ensure more transparency in the US and global.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness, this is a moment for changes.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind headrest companies.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need managers in the economy that are standing, saying," "" "Intransparent is not good for the business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">We need leading politicians that recognize the problem and to stop using this type of intransparency.</seg>
<seg id="95">Together we can finish the intransparent, which now still have this type of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering.</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story, as I was almost kidnapped and in the boot space of a red Mazdas landed.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I completed my design studies, I made a backyard.</seg>
<seg id="98">A type in the red Mazda stood and looked at my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my art works.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a road trip through the whole country. afterwards he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him on a beer. he was telling me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "while we paid the invoice, I made it to ask him:" "" "where do you sleep tonight?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">He made the whole thing even worse: "I don't know yet."</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought: "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just knew it only! he says he would go to the peace corps but I don't know if he really is that. I don't have been kidnapped in the boot space of a Mazdas!</seg>
<seg id="110">That is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard me: "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room."</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "a voice in my head said," "" "How to pray?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">In the night I was in bed, I cut off the blanket and thought, "Oh my! what have I broken up?</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy? "</seg>
<seg id="116">"" "I got a fear that I got out of the bed, at a tenth to the door, and my sleep door shut down." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The artwork, which he bought from me, depends today in his classroom. he is now teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">That was my first experience as a host. it has changed my eye-angle.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold in childhood as a stranger, actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">People on my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="123">Doing a leap, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I am unemployed, almost pleite, my fellow inhabitants attracts and the rental is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that there were a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think that creativity can do it, fear of fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote my best friend and new roommates Brian Chesky: "Brian, I guess what we could earn something. our apartment is on a designer bed-and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk, with a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a site and established such "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRB and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress in wood floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They loved it, and we also loved.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure to make sure our cheese-ham Omelet tastes completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We touring with them through the whole city. when we got our last guest and fell the door into the castle, starred Brian and I joined us.</seg>
<seg id="134">Did we just discovered that we find new friends at the same time and we could pay our rental?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came to the rolls.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former co-inhabitants, nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out whether it could be a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">So we presented to the investors: "we want to create a website, on the people publicly available photos of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their baths -- the kind of rooms whose doors are closed when visiting us.</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the internet, you can invite your alien people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited that the missile would burn.</seg>
<seg id="142">But she did not.</seg>
<seg id="143">No one who is still very good for comfort would invest in a shop that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we have learned all of us, strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have a problem, you mind on things which can be good. we were able to design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Fine Arts, we learned that design is much more than the appearance and haptics -- it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create confidence by design, among people who had never before ever before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design be afford something like?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create with design confidence?</seg>
<seg id="151">I want to give you a sample of what kind of confidence we aim.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will be out of your Comfortzone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up, if you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into the hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Enter your unlocked mobile phone on your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quiet Anflight of panic, which you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts will feel when they open the door.</seg>
<seg id="158">Because the only thing is personal as your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, you see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the unlocked mobile phone in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most of the responsibility of responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So the most guests feel when they are different.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only from this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Only sometimes, who actually has Al Gores mobile now?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you declare to Twitter that he is responsible for the Office of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">They now have experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I want to tell you some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What would be, if we have changed a little detail in this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor was first introduced to his name, if he tells, where he is coming, how his dog or his children are called?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine, you have 150 Beurfs that say all: "he can really take very well-locked mobile phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel if you would have to give your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-covered feedback system strengthens trust in decisive.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we have made some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was difficult for people who have negative assessments.</seg>
<seg id="175">Ultimately, we decided to wait until both hosts and guest appearances were submitted before we put them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study conducted by Stanford. we examined how probably it is that people trust in one another, according to what they are similar to age and place.</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprisingly we trust the people most, which are most similar.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less confidence we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social Voreflux.</seg>
<seg id="181">This is exciting if you add to the call of a person -- in our case by assessments.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three cases, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if you have more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation with similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">So the right design can help us to overcome some of our deep roots.</seg>
<seg id="186">In addition, we drove that confidence depends on it, how much to get there.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">If you say too little, like "Hi!," you won't get an answer.</seg>
<seg id="189">One much, how for example: "I have problems with my mother" -- -- will not be accepted on request.</seg>
<seg id="190">So there is an optimal degree of openness, e.g. "Tolle" in your apartment! I'm doing with my family holiday. "</seg>
<seg id="191">How to create it with design to restore these degrees to openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips to which topics do you want to write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our whole company is based on hope that the right design can help to overcome our advantages against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">With what we did not reckoned, the great amount of people who were more than ready to cancel these advantages.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you can see how many people will take our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">One can recognize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: unbelievably good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the untireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third: a demand that was not covered before.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us, the shop runs very well.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times if not all the smooth running.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests that have been celebrated parties or apartments have been devastated.</seg>
<seg id="203">We will have guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked on customer service. all calls arrived directly on my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the forefront, when confidence was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing but this calls. it is already hurt when I think only.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that listens to the voice of the aller, and will always be our biggest motivation to improve ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="208">Luckily, a fraction of 123 million was only a fraction each.</seg>
<seg id="209">For people trusted one another.</seg>
<seg id="210">When confidence work, we can create marvellous works.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay, he suffered a heart attack there.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host went into hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even ended blood for the necessary surgery!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is its assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travellers who tend to heart attack on heart attacks.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real protective gel that save lives, although they don't know it correctly.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive one in your own car, when you die, and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">"" "" "" "because they don't want to be lonely, they bring books." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="220">They can even stay longer without charge the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">Of course, course not every stay.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relationships behind pure money reaction are exactly what you want to achieve with Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I met this concept for the first time, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the thought of the part fit together with money transactions?</seg>
<seg id="226">It comes to economic trade here.</seg>
<seg id="227">"" "but it just now just" "" "rental industry" "" "is not just right." ""</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trading that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People lay a part of itself, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">If one travels today, it is efficient and reliable with fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">What if journeys would be a rich buffet from local inhibit?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if you were interested in any place to wait a group there, a group would wait to fill a thoroughly and to show a very neix quarter, of which one has never heard;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or when you can learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays apartments are designed in accordance with the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What would be, if we would like to make the apartments of reason why?</seg>
<seg id="236">How would this look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if towns would have to take advantage of the common share?</seg>
<seg id="238">I present cities, which allow us society and relationships, instead of loneliness and flyottinging.</seg>
<seg id="239">This project has already begun in South Korean capital Seoul, with lots of parking spaces that belonged to the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">Have now been offered residents. students who were looking for a lead in search of a lead,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were conveyed to people whose children were expelled. incubators were started,</seg>
<seg id="242">In order to finance new start-ups in Share Economy, over 785 000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a stranger or a self-host.</seg>
<seg id="243">The idea seems to be so mad as it was brought to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We don't have invented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality also gave it before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were already similar websites.</seg>
<seg id="247">Why has just our works?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from luck and timing we realized that you can find the right design with the existing customers.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us to overcome proverroot supplies.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find it amazing,</seg>
<seg id="251">Just overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it, when a red Mazda goes on to me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We know of course that design can not solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us if it had this great influence, I ask myself what we can use for design soon.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you do me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? a expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed, underwear a braining, a terror player?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in security check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">That is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't give you the debt for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media people represent, which look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study revealed that 80% of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: the Americans know my, most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people don't speak with their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">To all those who have never learned a Muslims: it's great to know you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I say you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I'm a mother, a coffee-operated -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am accused,</seg>
<seg id="271">A sealant-Fitness fan-fanatics,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing, spiritual Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not like Lady Gaga sing, for, baby, I was not born so born.</seg>

<seg id="275">When I was 17, I met the decision to ouched me.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as a homosexual man, as some of my friends, but as Muslims. I decided to carry out Hijab, my head cover.</seg>
<seg id="277">My feminist friends were horrified: "why do you feel yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">The Lusty was: at that time it was a feminist Declaration of Independence, which I felt like 17-year-old, I felt a perfect and unrible beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only accepted the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I took with the corals.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, thought I thought in question, doubted and believed ultimately.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was confidence and slow devotion that deepened themselves with any reading of the basket.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of the rhythmik will sometimes bring me to wines.</seg>
<seg id="285">I know myself about it. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Did you ever feel that somebody wants to perceive you completely, and but somehow loves?</seg>
<seg id="287">This is how it feels.</seg>
<seg id="288">Later I married and began as all the good Egyptians, my career as engineering.</seg>
<seg id="289">I was later, after my marriage, a child, and lived basically the "Egyptian-American dream."</seg>
<seg id="290">Then there came a terrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you remember probably exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">I sat in my kitchen at the end, looked at the end, looked on the screen and saw the word "Eilabouts."</seg>
<seg id="293">There was smoke, airplanes flew to buildings and people out of the buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was this?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disturbance?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock related quickly in indignation.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should I do so?</seg>
<seg id="299">I moved to the TV channel and heard:... "Muslim terrorists..."...,... in the name of Islam...,... "... Jihadists..."...</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh, my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">It is not only my country, but in the nu related me the acts of others from a civil war into a suspects.</seg>
<seg id="302">The same day we had to go through the Middle West of the USA to go into a new city and start the postgraduate course.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember, as I felt -- as we were silent -- as deep it went into my seat, and I was the first time to be recognized as Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved in this night in our apartment, in a new city, in which it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">"" "and then, I saw, and read the warnings of the National islamic organizations that besought:" "" "be careful," "" "Be careful," "" "Stay in well illuminated" "", "" "" "do not lead you" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed all the week inside.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday in that week -- the day in which Muslims are gathering together.</seg>
<seg id="308">"" "and again the warnings:" "" "does not go to this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">The feelings were wordently unfiltered and I heard of attacks on Muslims or of people who stayed for Muslims in the Free and struck.</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really brandances on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something was not felt right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because people who attacked this land, attacked our land.</seg>
<seg id="315">I got the rage of people to the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was too angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It's not easy to explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have nothing against questions, I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">They are the allegations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Today, we can say to people say: "there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we go on? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to join Muslims and excludes Mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my congregation as a tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">It only represents the question: are we bad or benchable?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know: a malicious tumor was removed as a whole and a benchant tumours only under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">Alternatives are pointless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims are Muslims, like all other Americans, no tumor in the body of the USA, but an important organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, Ersthelefer and Olympik.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques America to make sure?</seg>
<seg id="331">Perhaps there will be a few parking spaces, but not stop the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visit of a mosque leads to humans other faith tolerant, and bigger citizen participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as a head of the police in the Washington area, DC recently told: people are not involved in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their cellar or bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">At the radio process, it has found that it starts online. as the first it will cut off the person from their community, even by their family, so that the person believes, the terrorists are the true Muslims, and everyone who abhors their behaviour and their ideology, is a betrayal or of faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to avoid radicalization, we must stop the people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some are still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group of how the IS had its brood-ality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As Muslims, the mother, as humans, I think we have to do everything to stop a group as the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to their actions world when you recognize it as a representative of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam, like the Ku-Klux clan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology reasons in their "holy book."</seg>
<seg id="344">But when you cast a look at it, they don't drive them what they are in the "Holy Scripture."</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brood, which they can read these things into the scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam told me a amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because they regard iniquity to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him whether they have been in touch with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said, the problem was exactly the opposite. every spirit, having spoken it, brought them to silence, and told her that her anger would bring their sense to unrighteousness in the world, that would only bring them in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Of nothing inspired and something similar to their Wut sense, she was a main goal for the instrumentalization by extremists who spoke to a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This imam set up the connection to God and their church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accuse them to accuse their wounds, he showed her constructive ways for a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque, she kept before to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">That was an insight, like the Islamophobia me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it work on normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it work for every other?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour benefit from fear every day to our democracy, on our thought's freedom?</seg>
<seg id="358">A study - actually, several neuroscienticular studies - show: if we fear, there will happen at least three things.</seg>
<seg id="359">We rather accept an authoritarian government system, conformity and advantages.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study shows: if you report test messages in which negatively reported to Muslims, they were rather military attacks on Muslim countries, as well as the circumcision of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">When you look when the mood swinging Muslims at the top -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never happens in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It came ahead of the war of Iraq and during two electoral periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction on Muslim terror, as I expected it.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool for manipulation to be open to the foundation of a free society that have sensible and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We might feel it as the first, but the toxic air of fear would fall us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">With the assignment of collective innocence, it is not only going to declare himself to themselves.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both of them went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a sportsman.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was at the dental faculty, talented, promising...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would say to me that he was the adest, most generous man knew whom they knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her life. she was blossom and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"when is such a young man diversified from my breasts?"</seg>
<seg id="375">Just a few weeks after the visit of Suzanne with her brother and his wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, she was murdered in the afternoon, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan which had posted in the afternoon. he did it in her apartment, after he posted execution against Muslims on his Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="376">He shot up eight times at Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanatism can not only be immoral, but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Are we going to the mosque or stayed at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We see it and for us it was not a slight decision because it was going to leave America to let us leave our children: one that would control us through fear, or one in whom we can freely practise our religion.</seg>
<seg id="382">We opted for the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">We drove the farm with our son in the children's seat, with high pressure to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, my shoes moved out, went into the building hall, and what I looked, left me.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was restless filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam announcement, an announcement, and called our guests welcome, because half of the gathered Christians were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers, and non-believers who were come, not to attack us, but around us.</seg>
<seg id="387">In that moment I joined together.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had the courage and compassion on panic and prediscern.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose from the moment of anxiety and the fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you go to number sure?</seg>
<seg id="392">You will connect to them that are: we are better than those that are.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you nice!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have a nerve.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I wonder what you say that you may say that you are a TEDTalk, a monument with deep thought are working in a noble mind factory, so an exception and not the rule rule.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say that you don't think. I'm totally normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">I am no exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">I'm as usual as it is allowed.</seg>
<seg id="402">When you look at Muslims in all over the world, and I did that with the largest ever conducted study on Muslims in all over the world, people want to normal things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want prosperity for the family, they want work, and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I am not an exception in any respect.</seg>
<seg id="405">If people appear as an exception, then often the rule is broken, and they are not the exception to the rule.</seg>
<seg id="406">HW: thank you. Dalia Mogahed.</seg>
<seg id="407">What began as a platform for Basters, just before that one billion business can be used.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones. made possible in research institutes worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before the aerial view in our social awareness in the Frac Centre, a autonomous fleet of airmachines in the Frac Centre in France built a six metre high tower from 1 500 bricks. some years ago they began to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">By connecting you can achieve high speed and acceleration on the smallest space.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build self-consuming structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to carry loads with turbulences and to react to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you a few of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of possible in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">In order to make a system autonomous, it must be collectively interpret, where the mobile objects are located in the room.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects. that allows us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic Tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a publisher of our laboratories.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in space, calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "external commands are available at the highest image e. g." "" "and" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called rear starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A flight machine that tries to beat two flying with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starters, it is efficient in the forward flight, much more efficient than helicopters in all its variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most of the starters, it can be bored, and so great benefits at start and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">But there is always a sweeping side.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of hedgeons is that they react sensitive to turbulences such as wind bös.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the flight doesn't matter how the optimum position can be recovered and the performance can be improved.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often provide basic abstract questions that approach the core of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question would be for example: what is the small number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for this to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with thousands of moving parts, which are exterminished, to violate you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago, trained pilot-controlled pilots could fly, which had only two moving parts: a propeller and a rear side.</seg>
<seg id="435">We discovered that flies only works with just one.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the Monospinner, the mechanically easiest remote control unit. it was invented in front of short.</seg>
<seg id="437">It only has an eventful part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No clapping, hinges and transverse rusters, no further positions or control surfaces, only a propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanically simple, in the inner life seems very much, that it may be stable and can move up in space.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless, it does not have an elegant algorithm of the tailgate. to bring it to flying, I have to throw it properly.</seg>
<seg id="441">The likelihood to throw it exactly right when you see all, is small, therefore I'll show you a video that was filmed in the evening last night.</seg>
<seg id="442">When the Monospinternal is a practice in Genugsburg, this machine is here, the omcopter with its eight propellers, a exercise in overflow.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this overflow?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">Therefore he is ambivalent in his alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">As a result, he receives the auditory ability,</seg>
<seg id="447">In the room to move in all directions, no matter what direction he is turned, or even as he rotates.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course, it is complex, mainly in the field of interactive rivers of eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">A lot is shown in models that will learn the rest directly at the fly.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let us see that.</seg>
<seg id="451">When flying machines should be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is composed of two separate twin-propeller aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="453">This is clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">If you build it together, such as a high-performance quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">But there's something wrong -- a motor or propeller falls off, the electronics or a battery - can continue to fly the machine even if restricted.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate that by being able to make a half of flight.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration investigates synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units enables a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took commercial micro-quadcopter -- each individual weighs less than one slice of bread -- and outfit it with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Every unit white, where in the room it is and is self-controlled. there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully, you motivate these demonstrations to think new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine there would like to be a flying lampshade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us is the reward in the development and the activity act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a reminder, how wonderful and magical our universe is, and that it creatives, claws allow them to form a spectacular fashion.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive industrial and economic potential, the dot is on the i.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="469">Prior to 1.3 billion years ago, two black holes in a very far distant galaxy in a very far distant galaxy, they turned into a tenths of pure energy in a tenth of a tenth deal with pure energy.</seg>
<seg id="470">For this short moment, they lighteners brighter than all the stars in all the galaxies of the whole universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very great dummy.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they put their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The whole energy was put into space-time gearing itself and exploded the universe in Gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us take the events first time.</seg>
<seg id="476">1.3 billion years ago, it was just a multizellious life originated on the earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then the Earth has brought a lot closer: corals, fish, plants, Saurier, people and -- God arise, even the internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, a group of particularly muffness -- Rai Weiss decided by MIT, KIP Thorne and Ronald Drever -- a huge laser detector to search for gravitational waves, which arise about by collized black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most held them for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough humans knew her as a mad genius, so that the U.S. National Science Foundation financed her idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of decades, design, design, conception and extremely much hard work they built the detector LIGO: the laser interferometriot gravitational Observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the subsequent time, the precision of LIGO could significantly increase significantly, which improved the detection performance.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is called Advanced LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015, LIGO was launched for a last test run to clarify some minor, persistent issues.</seg>
<seg id="485">On 14 September 2015, only a few days after the commissioning of the detector, the gravitational waves of the two colored holes were through the earth through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The Birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the goodbye of my todgoeth father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically there were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All that which I worked for me is not longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretically physicist at MIT. he has been investigating Gravitational waves in black holes and their through observatories, such as LIGO measurable signals. what are gravitational waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is an forces in the wake of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When passing the shaft, the space and its whole content will be stretched into one direction and into the other hand.</seg>
<seg id="495">To illustrative Dozers lead to the relativity on the theory of theory often a really alberable dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretchy and dusty, stretching and dusty."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational waves extremely weak, even ridiculous, are diculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On September 14, for example, everyone was stretched out on the waves of the waves and stopped. the stretch of an average people was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">This means 20 zeros after the comma, followed by 1. therefore the LIGO collaborator for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five-kilometer laser detector, and this is absurd, it would have to be measured at less than a thousandths of a radius of a atomic fact. this is grotesk.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text about gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">Described "" "" "" "KIP Thorne, a co-founder LIGOs, the hunt after waves as follows:" "" "the technical difficulties of building such detectors are massive." ""</seg>
<seg id="503">But physicist are invalid and with the support of the public will be overcome all obstacles. "</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this in 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to LIGO. Scott claims that LIGO is more than one eye than one eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than things around us: visual lifts, the size of your mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="508">That is quite practical. for example, you can make a picture or map of things by taking it out of several points for you.</seg>
<seg id="509">In killing, it is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">This is why it is very hard to produce a picture of things which mean you especially much:</seg>
<seg id="512">About the face of your child.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead, we listen to certain properties such as pitch and level, rhythm and volume to close behind the story behind.</seg>
<seg id="514">"now Alice speaks Alice."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts them."</seg>
<seg id="516">"drummer Bob".</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We can't produce any simple pictures of objects in all.</seg>
<seg id="519">But looking forward to changes in the amplitude and frequency of waves, we can listen to us their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least the measured frequencies are available at least for LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="521">So when we convert wave pattern in sound, we can hear the all literally.</seg>
<seg id="522">The gravitation is to listen to us about the collision of two black holes, which deals with my colleague Scott already very long.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-rotating holes, cirpen simple: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Turning the two body very quickly, you hear the same cpen with an additional sound change. listen to: Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of motion-making, stamped into the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on 14th September 2015 -- a date which at least I never forget -- I heard LIGO: [Surrender the sound] Jone, who knows what he needs to hear, recognize this as the sound of -- SH:... two black holes with 30 times of solar mass, which are swift as fast as the rods of your mixer.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: we are superior to us what does that mean.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the densest body in all, one with a mass of 29 ropes, the other with a mass of 36 suns, revolve each hundred times a second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know of it, because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">This is the lasting meaning of LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="533">LIGO paving a completely new way to explore the universe as it was never before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way, we can listen to all and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in all, we can not see -- practically or basically --.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why the stars in super novae explode.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we have learned a lot about all of them.</seg>
<seg id="538">The exciting physical periods happen in the nucleus that is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see, since they are opak.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational waves penetrating iron, when it would be transparent glass. I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it because the urking covers his own offspring.</seg>
<seg id="541">With the help of gravitational waves it should be possible until the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And the most important thing: I'm optimistic, that in all things we have never seen that we have never seen and we don't have any idea. things we can only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, LIGO found equally in the first attempt of things that we didn't expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the LIGO project, says to this topic: ME: the kind of stars that produce black holes, such as LIGO, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient body from prehistoric times. the black holes are so to speak the sour cream for our archeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">LIGO enables us a completely different viewing angle to the events in all, on the emergence of the stars and ultimately, as we went out of that chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is to be so courageous just as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to LIGO we know how to builds great detectors and listen to the noise and the roof of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new Observatories -- a completely new generation of observatories on the earth and in all.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what might be nice to listen to the great crushing itself?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now the time is great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dreams with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">I tried a experiment before a time.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "one year long, I would say to all" "" "Yes!" "" "I was afraid of whom I feared." ""</seg>
<seg id="556">No matter whether it turned me nervous, brought me into unpleasant situations, I forced me to say "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="557">Wanted I speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Wanted I live live in television?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Wanted to start playing with the Schaumann?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a mad thing happened: exactly what to do, wovor I was afraid, removed my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear to keep speeches, my social fear -- Puff, away.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes" has changed my life.</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain Yes that changed my life on an unexpectedly. it started with a question of my sons.</seg>
<seg id="569">I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett, and Emerson. and Emerson, the Kleinblest, calls for all "estimation,"</seg>
<seg id="570">When she was a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"certified, I need milk for my sumbilical mass."</seg>
<seg id="572">She asked them, if I could play with her, when I was just at the leap. and I said, "yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new life setting in my family. from there I swear to me always to play with them. no matter what I'm doing, or whither I go, I always say Yes -- every single times.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect, but I feel very tired.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, on my children, on our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has a blossom tribution: only recently, I was really good that the "Yes" -Sagen to play my career with my children.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am writer. I think I guess what you are going to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No. no.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am an Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create TV. I have producer television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I am TV, in large style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season, I'm responsible for this to carry 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four television programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are in production simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each programme offers hundreds of jobs that existed before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a television senders can lie between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let's say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode all nine days four shows, so every nine days 20 million dollar television, four television programmes, 70 hours TV, three shipments, which are simultaneously in production, times four, 16 episodes: Scandal, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Pot, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours of TV,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my TV series run on Thursday night.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world, my series run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broadcasts that I created itself, and not only produced, so I must find time, really silent, creative time to gather my fans in bonfires and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four television series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires, around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who still does it?</seg>
<seg id="598">No one, therefore I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress it.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it, because I know what you think if the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">I say to you, that all of you who do so hard if you're a company, a land or a classroom, to understand that I don't just say that I'm not just the computer, and it is right when I say: I understand that there is a dream job for dreams.</seg>
<seg id="603">It's all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work much, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I deepens in the work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is when I set up troops as a maline I was on canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">As for dreamed a high sound, liefs a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">One feels like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that is at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work it.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creative, mechanically, angled and deprized, clinically, and maternal, cruel and sensual, cruel and sensual. and the best of it is the sums.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the job runs well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A sums starts in my head, and it grows and growing, and the sums hear like a lively street, I could go for ever on her.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people participate, if I declare unto them the sums that I write to them that the letter is prepared for me.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong, that does it.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the sums -- when I started working with the TV production, when I began to work and to work, to create and merge, I discovered this thing, this sums, this energy.</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums is more than the writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sums is action and activity. the sums is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The sums is music. the sums is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The sums of God is the voice of God in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have a sums, you can't do differently than size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling, not different to strive, than to size, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the sums.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or perhaps it means a workage to be too.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is called Ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it's the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I only know that I am not doing for the failure, and I only know that I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="631">I will only say you, I am a titanium, and I know that I don't want it in question.</seg>
<seg id="632">In order to make a clear: the more successive limits, the more episodes, the more periods, the more work is, the more works at the same time, the more watch I write history, the more expectations are there.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more must work me.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I do about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The country, I create, the marathon, which I run, the army, the screen, the high tone, the sums, the sums.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sums. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the sums.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I only this sums?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Revised, reclaimed, exaggerated, exaggerated.</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their mom is a single job.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells us: "my mom will not be there, but you can write my Nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"" "and Emerson says:" "" "I want to go to Shonda land." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="646">They are the children of a titanium.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are Baby-Titanen.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the sums ceased.</seg>
<seg id="649">The sums of the engine stopped.</seg>
<seg id="650">I loved my work anymore. I loved the engine.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums came not back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My sums was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I did the same things as always: the same titanium work, 15 hours-day, continuous weekends, no deaf, nothing to delegate, one Titan sleeps not, aren't there, with all your heart, clear eyes, whatever is always.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sums.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four television programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four television programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect titanium.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a preshow-Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was gray, I just had no fun anymore.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">All that I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the sums and the sums was I.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what's what to do, what to do, the work which I love to do suddenly?</seg>
<seg id="665">I know, some say, "Heule you from, stupid the author Titan."</seg>
<seg id="666">But you don't know what to do, you love what to be a teacher, a painter, Bill Gates, you love one another and that's what the sums feel, and know how the sums feel like what the sums stops, who is one then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you doing?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">If the song of my heart hear, I can survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">And then me my "southern states" waitress "a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "I am on the way to outside, late and she says," "" "Mom, do you play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I don't want to say more than me two things:</seg>
<seg id="674">"" "first, I have to say Yes to everything and second, she called me not" "" "" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="675">She calls no more "estimation."</seg>
<seg id="676">When is it happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">I hate it, if I am Titan bin and my sums, and here everything changes in front of my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">And so said they: "mom, do you like to play?"</seg>
<seg id="679">And I say: "yes."</seg>
<seg id="680">It is nothing special.</seg>
<seg id="681">We play and you encounter their sisters, we laugh much and I read all very dramatic from the book "Everybody Poops" in front of the book.</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding because my pain and my panic, in loneliness and in the absence of the sums, I can do nothing to fit out.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">The country, I create, the marathon, which I run, the army, the screen, the high tone - they don't exist anymore.</seg>
<seg id="687">All that exists are sticky fingers and moist kisses, delicate voices, wax pencils and the song, in which it goes for lot, or whatever the girl in "The Ice Queen" is released.</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so close that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I atme.</seg>
<seg id="691">It is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door comes to and an energizer comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that is not immediately, but it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums come back slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, hardly there, it is quiet, hardly audible, but it is there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the sums, but a sums.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel when I know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay in the case.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something that we forgot.</seg>
<seg id="705">The sums, the workmen, the titanium dioxide, that is only the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you, who are you if I am you who I am sending me through shipments and TV hours and how working my brain, then I forgot what the real sums is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The sums is not strength and it is not unemployed.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real sums depends on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The sums is the river, which comes from the desire of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real sums is self-conscious and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The real sums ignored the pressure of history, which are to do with the anticipation and pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real sums is simple and originally.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real sums of God is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps whispered to me the wrong words, for which God said to me that I am a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a little more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say Yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I do this for the fixed rule, so that I can rid me as a Workolic of any fault.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is a law, I have no other choice. I have no choice if I want to hear the sums.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so simple. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">Don't play a full way as working.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth is hurt,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I am always working, because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I am rather at the workplace as home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This ingestion is painful, because what a man better works than to be home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, yes, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">"" "honest, I call myself" "" "Titan" ""</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too, is none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">We were around in the garden around, before and back.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We crushed silk bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">Yet I feel greater stiff, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always go to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live, and the sums of the universe met me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play, till I ask myself: why have we heard with the playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also say it! say it always Yes, if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Perhaps you keep me for naiv, for a day dream.</seg>
<seg id="742">There you are right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And you also know why? you are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child finds you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play at a maximum of 15 minutes with me until they make it something else.</seg>
<seg id="748">There are wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes, a Marienkosfers or biscuit replaces me.</seg>
<seg id="750">And I speak my tey-daughter for 15 minutes with me, I am the mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">There are only 15 minutes, more needs it not need.</seg>
<seg id="752">Every one can bring 15 minutes a piece, even at a bad-Laune-Day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes a piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">No phone, no clothes, no waste.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children are finished.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are drin!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my well-sensitive, my world. it must not be the children. it is true to feel the sums to feel a place for his soul peace.</seg>
<seg id="758">It doesn't go with the own children. it's about pleasure,</seg>
<seg id="759">To play the "Play" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Get the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you do well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and keep it.</seg>
<seg id="763">I'm not perfect in it. I fail and I count. friends meet, books read the day --</seg>
<seg id="764">"" "" "" "do you want to play?" "" "is short for everything I got up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in education, when I wanted to surge myself more and more." ""</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes on the piece, why not be full 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sums returned to my free time. the sums seems to return soon, if I don't work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Work does not work without play.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months, a door open to the energy and I find me again in my office. I hear a well-known melody, she meets me and my soul. I will lead me to new ideas. I use it in full trains and love my work again.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the sums, but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I'm not the sums, the sums is not... more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Bubble bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">Now that is my sums.</seg>
<seg id="775">The sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The sums of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The sum of the work is part of me but just a part. and therefore I'm so grateful.</seg>
<seg id="778">It's me to see that I am a Titan bin. I never have seen a Titan Poker that plays to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said Yes to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything in handle. my brain is still working. my campfires are still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">The more I play, the happy are I and my children.</seg>
<seg id="782">The more I play, the more I feel good as good mother.</seg>
<seg id="783">The more I play, the more clear is my head.</seg>
<seg id="784">The more I play, the better I am working.</seg>
<seg id="785">The more I play, the more I hear the sums. the land, which I create, the marathon, which I run, the trout, the high clay, the sums, the sums, the other, the correct sums: the sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="786">The more I feel this sums, the more makes this unusual, relaxing, naked and new feeling in me. less Titan -- more I!</seg>
<seg id="787">The more I feel exactly this sums, the more I know what I am.</seg>
<seg id="788">I am writer. I think I think I raised you to life.</seg>
<seg id="789">This belongs to the Job, which means to live his dream.</seg>
<seg id="790">That is the dream of this job,</seg>
<seg id="791">For a dream job should be a little dreaming.</seg>
<seg id="792">I said "Yes" to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you nice.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am Neurosurgin.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues I have to do with the human tragedy every day.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to the other, after a heavy stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us, neurosurgery is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability to self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a serious violation of central nervous system the patients often have a lasting, heavy disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I was functional Neurosurgin.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nervous functions through different surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">Certainly they have heard of one of the best known, the "underground-irstimulation." it implanted a electrode deep in the brain in order to influence the circuits of neurons, so that the neurological function is improved.</seg>
<seg id="805">It is really an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease that suffered under heavy trembling and serious pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation does not mean Neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeon is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">We approach to this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I want to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">With a little help, the brain can help themselves.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story started 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was leading medical doctor and worked in the emergency recovery day and night.</seg>
<seg id="813">I often served patients with cranial brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They must imagine that with cranial brain traumata the brain is gently inclined and the cranial pressure is rising.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save the life, you have to reduce the cranial pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">It is sometimes necessary to remove a part of swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyse with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, to analyze the brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this fabric.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not a light task.</seg>
<seg id="821">Cells from a tissue increase, it is comparable to all small children that will be taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You have to find the right diet, temperature, moisture and environments to thrive them.</seg>
<seg id="823">That was exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts it did Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="825">This he saw under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells that are surrounded by small, unripe cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you can still know from the biological lessons that stem cells are irmature, which can transform itself into any cell type of organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niche of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to receive this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the OP.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they are very fast.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells stopped different.</seg>
<seg id="835">They divided slowly and after a few weeks, they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, strange cell population, which looked like stem cells, but looked different.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand where they came.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doubollortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our native brain cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the stage of the Fötus, they take care of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they keep us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know this.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they participate in the healing of the brain, since we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so safe.</seg>
<seg id="848">But one thing is clear -- of these cells, we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We stand in front of a potential cell source that enables brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non-language field and then the cells were cultivated exactly as it did Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="853">And then mark the color to track them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step we implanted them at the entrance examination of the same individuals.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplantation -- autootrantransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we implanted these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we implanting the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we were able to work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario, we implanted the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that they were taken after some weeks, they would go back home. the room is already occupied, they are not used there, so disappear them.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario, we opened an injury and implanted exactly the same cells, and now the cells remained to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could see under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were implanted.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence showing them are these small points. these are the cells that we found in vitro in the culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Of course we couldn't stop.</seg>
<seg id="864">Help these cells also help to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual skillity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">You had to take food from a tablet.</seg>
<seg id="867">They did it very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they achieved a stable skill level, we missed the motechnology range in the motor Cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">The monkeys were paralyzed, they could not move their hand anymore.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen in humans, they recovered spontaneously up to a certain degree, just as after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">The patients are paralyzed and then try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. they recover yourself at a certain degree, just as in the monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left side, they see the monkey, who restarted spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can bring about 40% to 50% of its original power from injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now, when we implanted the cells: the same monkey, two months after the mimplantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were also very exciting results.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we found much more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze and use them later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other neuropathological models, for example at Parkinson.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still alive to implanting them in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can show you soon how the human brain is the means to heal himself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that just now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think, "I know anyone who need it."</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely want.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what the greatest obstacles are, before you can start clinical studies in humans.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from this great results you need to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to run this type of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and a very professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look at the future -- you have completed the research and tried to take permission to start the clinical trials. if you look forward to the future, how many years it will take until somebody can come to the hospital, and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First it depends on the approval of clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it allow us to start the authority to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It already needs a long time to select the patients to perform treatments and evaluate it, whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">You need to apply this to a multi-centric study.</seg>
<seg id="897">It is necessary to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you tell us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">In the West we make a big mistake to consider it as a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">We don't see democracy not as the fragile plant, which is in reality, but as inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider it as an unchangeable danger.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism are forced to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That is not right.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great imitators in Beijing have desperate that it is quite possible to have a blooming capitalism and impressive growth, while the policy remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">In fact the democracy comes with us, in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year, when I presented Greece - the newly elected Greek government -- was unclear to me as a finance minister in the Eurogroup - that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- do not influence the savings programmes that were realized in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">In this moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my promised friends who would repeat to me, that the democracy would change anything if they would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to introduce a economic model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I ask you to believe again with me again that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the euro group of a mistake, we could save us the democracy, but that we need a true and defective democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">For without democracy, our societies are common, our future nozzles and our great, new technologies are wasted.</seg>
<seg id="914">On the subject of waste, I would like to prove to have interesting contradiction that our tavern are threatened.</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "twin-summit Paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">A summit is known to you. you know and know him as the Schodenberg, who throws its long shadows over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all know the Schodenberg,</seg>
<seg id="918">Yet few detect his tedymus.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash, which belongs to the veritable asparagus and corporations, which could be able to invest there, where it would be productive and income if it could produce and all the things that humanity is urgently needed, for example "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past 3 months, in the US, in England and the Eurozone, 3.4 billion US dollars were invested in all the wealth of goods, such as industrial plants, machines, office buildings, schools, streets, tracks, gear, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">"" "" "" "" "" "3.4 billion US Dollars" "" "sounds much money to get it with the 5.1 trillion US dollars, which were at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing did, except the stock exchange and real estate prices." ""</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus, debts and unproductive capital produce the twin peaks that cannot represent by the usual market mechanisms of mechanics.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result are stagnating wages, more than one quarter of the 25-54-year-old in the US, Japan and Europe, thus ensuring low demand for investors, which could not invest in which they will not invest. just as Ödipus Father, who could not invest in which they could kill him, that his son would kill him if he is growing,</seg>
<seg id="925">Unrolled up the circumstances that lead him that Ödipus kill him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my Hades with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">Its extremely common Art. All the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives and particularly all the technologies, "green" technologies that are decisive for salvation of the earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">I think so. but before we proceed: what do we understand under democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the social form, in which the open and the poor as a majority are control the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">The athenian democracy, of course too many of --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, it would be an error to reduce the job value of athenic democracy due to these expressions.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decision on the athenian democracy was and is that they did not only accept the right to free expression, but not only the right to free expression, but important and crucial, that they had the right to maintain political co-determination in question of the government.</seg>
<seg id="935">The athenian democracy have not held a long time --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle that illuminates very bright, it is also quickly developed quickly.</seg>
<seg id="937">But our current liberals have not their roots in the ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While athenian democracy focused on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy based on Magna Carta, which ultimately became a statute for ruling.</seg>
<seg id="940">For the liberal democracy only came up as a complete separation between politics and economy and the democratic process was abandoned, while the economy -- thus the world of the corporations -- a democrab-free zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In our present democracies, since the time, in which this separation of politics and economy started, an uninherent battle between the two instead, the economy slowly wandered and mainstated.</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why the politicians are no longer like former?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not on a Degeneration of its DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is that one can be in the government today and nonetheless not in power because the power of politics entered into the economy and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I chose my hair with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is like a herd of smokes, which is so lasting the animals, of which they are nourished, decimated that it is therefore hungry for the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">Similarly, it is similar to the economy that grows to politics as far as far. the power of the corporations is growing, political goods are increasing, the economic demand is rising and the management of the corporations are waste to invest the cash of their company.</seg>
<seg id="948">According to the successful capitalism, "demos" [the people] of democracy distributes, the higher will be the twins summit, and the greater the waste of human labour and prosperity of mankind.</seg>
<seg id="949">If that's true, it is obvious that we have to bring together the policy and the economy, and it would be better when the "demos" reserves the control, as in the ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist Linke had this idea already 100 years ago and it did not survive well.</seg>
<seg id="952">The doctrine of Debakel of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor is only repeated by a miracle like in the ancient Athens, without creating new species of brood and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: creating the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by doing low wages by automation and robotic system.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is, so long economy and politics are separate areas, the automation will be higher, the failures, and social conflicts deeper as it -- already very soon as I think -- in countries such as China will come.</seg>
<seg id="956">So we need to restore the economy and the economy and politics, and make sure that we can reclaim the reunified area, otherwise we will end into a illness-called surveillance-Hyperautocracy which will appear the film "Matrix" as a documentation.</seg>
<seg id="957">So the question is not whether capitalism has brought the technical achievements that he will survive.</seg>
<seg id="958">The more interesting question is whether capitalism is affected by a dystopia similar to "matrix," or by something that the company will serve people and human energy into the research of the universe, or into a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians "Agora," in long talks about the sense of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So how could it look like this "Star Trek" should look like this "Star Trek" instead of the "matrix" like-like dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation, I would like to give you some examples in all of you.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the company of the company: ask a capital market, where you will earn money, while you are working and in which your capital takes you from a company to the next, and the company -- no matter where you just works -- is property of them that are currently working in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income from capital and proceeds from funds and the concept of wage work is completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">No differentiation between them that are the company, which are not working in it, and employees working there, which the company does not belong. there are no taux between capital and work, no large leaps between investment and donors, and ultimately no emporous twins.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the field of global political economics: please note that our national currencies would have a free fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which is issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest emerging markets], in the interest of all humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency - we call it "the cosmos," in units of "Kosmos," and every government pays the sum of which the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the country is equivalent to a common fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund has invested in "green" technologies, particularly in parts of the world where investment funds are rar.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes had been proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it was not necessary to implement the technical resources.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today we have it, particularly in front of a reunified politics and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world, which I protect you can be liberalized at the same time, in which they privileged privileged people, and marxistic, because they have buried the separation of capital and work in the trash of history, and keynesian, globally keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But over all others it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Are we awakening in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">"" "or will we fall into a" "" "matrix" "" "- similar dystopia?" ""</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on it, as we were politically politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands, and we do it better.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You gave yourself in your biography itself as a liberal Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's Analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if any of what I have just said, Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for reunification of politics and economy... do we do not know the technological development will produce a massive decline in overall economic demand, which Larry Summers as "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">Through the transfer of this crisis from a part of Earth to the next, as we are currently experiencing it will not only destabilize our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberalization democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this is true, Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">As well as Hayek, therefore I am a liberal Marxist, and like Keynes, and therefore I am also perfect.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: actually, and now we are well.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you are not effective, you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein who said this. BG: in your presentation, Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of the Redner you have very clearly said that you keep from the perspective of the West to China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Want to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great degree of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies, we have the certificate of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my lecture, we have limited the democracy to politics, while the area where most of them plays, -- the area of the economy -- a completely democrab-free zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In a certain respect, if I may say that such provocation, China is similar to the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">Because -- do you remember - we tend to combine liberalism with democracy -- this is a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, liberals, such as John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly skeptical, regarding the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What you can watch in China, similar to the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">China now to do that which the West has done to the West in the 19th century, smells rapidly after hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I'm sure that many listeners were curious to share your experiences as a finance minister in the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I thought that this comes.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back for six months later?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from personal perspective, and very disappointing, because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece, but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">Namely from the self-counterfle to say goodbye to the eurozone, a massive rewarding line through the Eurozone was, and continues to increase the development of all European Union massively.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity to open the first proposal on the basis of Greek's first proposal -- the way, which denying this denying --</seg>
<seg id="1008">It is true to do. unfortunately, the powers have been chosen within the Eurozone, in the Europe group, still denying denying.</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If one tries to receive an economic system that is not supervable to receive through political will and authority, you may have any longer a while, but if the change occurs, it happens abruptly and destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what change do you see?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future, if we do not change their setup.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: do you have any mistake in your time as a finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back at harvest...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a Minister of Finance, or any minister, who after 6 months in office, especially in a so clamped situation, claims that he did not make a mistake, then it is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made errors.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The greatest mistake was to sign the application for renewal of the debt programme at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honourable interest in the money system to find a joint solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that was not there.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They only wanted to get our government, only because they wanted not to employ with the mergings, who ran through the euro zone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They didn't want to stand, that they have been catastrophic program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost a third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">There is worse than during the "Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="1026">None of the Troika of the Money, who has imposed us this policy: "this was a colossess error."</seg>
<seg id="1027">BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive toons of talks, you seem to be quite happy too.</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">My criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone, which comes from somebody who lives and loves.</seg>
<seg id="1030">My greatest fear is that the euro zone does not survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">For if they do not survive, the released flippers will be demonic and destroy the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This will not have catastrophic consequences for Europe, but for the entire world economy.</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">"" "" "" "if we were able to smite ourselves the way of a post in 1930, when it appears to be out, it will also be as well as to the future of the Europeans as well as the non-Europeans." ""</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope very that you are wrong in this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Yanis, thank you that you were at TED.</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thanks.</seg>
<seg id="1038">By Roy Price, most of them have never heard, although it is responsible for 22-moderate minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision to hit the Roy three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is leading employee at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">He is 47 years old, slender, has an Igelfrisur and describes himself on Twitter as a "films, TV, technique, tacos."</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for making the shows and content to the Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course, this is a very hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are already so many TV series that Roy cannot select any thing.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He must find shows that are very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he must find shows that are located at the right side of this turn.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the evaluation division of more than 2500 TV series on the website IMDB. the rating is from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this rating.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Will show your show with nine and higher, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These are shows how "Breaking Bad", "Game of Thrones," The Wire "-- all the shows that are addictive to addictive, your brain asks:" where are there any more of these episodes? "</seg>
<seg id="1053">This type of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left, here at this end, shows how "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- -- this should tell you enough what to go to that end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price does not manage to do on the left side of the turn, because I don't need special intelligence to teach "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes himself more thoughts on the average expulsion, the average television -- the shows that neither good nor bad, they are simply inspiring.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must ensure that he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is present, and of course, it is the first time that Amazon is going to do something, therefore Roy Price wants nothing risky.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needed a guaranteed success, so he holds a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">It takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of this shows and presents them online where you can view it free of charge.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon is free to get out things, do you feel right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of spectators look at this episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they don't know that they are observed at the watch of this shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They will be watching by Roy and his team to record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You capture when you start the show when you paused that parts you skips or look again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">You collect millions of data to decide with these data then you should produce which show them.</seg>
<seg id="1068">In fact, they process the data, process and this is the answer, and this is: "Amazon should make a SitCom for four Republican US transmitters."</seg>
<seg id="1069">They did this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Yes, "Alpha House," but it seems that not many of these show can remember because it was not so good.</seg>
<seg id="1072">It is just an average show -- on the meaning of the word -- since the average of this turn is 7.4 and Alpha House rose above average, but not just what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About the same time with another company, another manager has been placed a top show by data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program creation of Netflix. exactly like Roy, he is always on the search to find this a super-show and he is using data for it, but he makes it something different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of a competition, he and his team looked forward to the existing information about the Netflix viewer, so the reviews that they give the shows, the course of which shows them like etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then use these data to find this small details on the audience: what shows them like the producer, what actor.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts, they entered a wagon, and decided to make a SitCom for four transmitters, but a drama series about a senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards". Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9,1 rating based on this curve. so exactly where they wanted.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course, the question is: what happens here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">One has two very competent, data diversified.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data and it works great for one of them but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because the logic states that this should work in all.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you collect millions of data, for a decision that meets it, you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">It has 200 years of statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized by very powerful computer.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The minest thing you can expect is good television, or?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis is not working so, this is something terrifying because we are living in a time, in which we are more and more about statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">No. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that nobody ever comes in contact with this software. come in contact with this software, you are in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If anyone asks here in the US in prison and for release, it is likely to determine whether the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a release is done or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like at Amazon and Netflix. but rather than to decide whether a show is good or bad, it will be decided whether a person is good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Medium TV, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that these data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are produced. this is not sure that a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">The data of diversified companies are also wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google makes mistakes bugs.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that they may have been preceded by data analysis of flu, the worst type, predicting -- through data analysis of the Google research.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news of news. the success gifted in a publication in the "Nature" magazine.</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked fine, year around year, until it suddenly didn't work anymore,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It didn't work, this was again a sensation, including the revocation of the publication in the "Nature" magazine.</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data of experienced companies such as Amazon and Google don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all these mistakes, data came to the decisions of life a -- on the workplace, in the legal entity, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">Thus, we should rather ensure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-based Genetics -- an area where some very clever people use unimaginable people to make serious decisions as the decision for cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I recognized some patterns on the difference between successful decisions using data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be disseminated.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you have to solve a complex problem, they mainly do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">As a first, put this problem in its individual parts, so that you can analyze individual parts; as a second place you put the components together to hold a disconnection.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you need to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and assemble again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, you can help to break a problem and to understand his parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to add the parts again and then to a disconnection.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool and we are all: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something that the brain is good, it is parts and pieces again, even if the information is incomplete, even if the information is incomplete, especially when it is the brain of a expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Therefore, I think it was Netflix so successful because they have data and understanding, where they also belong to the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">You can use data to understand their audience better, why they would not have been unable, but the decision to put all these parts, again and make it a show as "House of Cards" that was not in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant that they entered a big personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">And Amazon did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their decisions, first as they chose TV ideas when they selected "Alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "it was a safe decision because they could say:" "" "let us tell us the data." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It does not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful for better decisions, but I believe that things wrong when data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and in order to forget that this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the decisions for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It is also called "Magic 8 Ball." it is astonishing. for decisions by a Ja- or no-question you will need to shake the ball to get an answer. "most likely" -- exactly here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will run it later with a technical demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far, I met some decisions in my life, where I had to hear the ball in the afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you know of course if you have the data available, you would like to replace them with a lot of excels, such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not have the basic body.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So, perhaps the ball cheer and klüger. ultimately it's to make decisions on us if we want to reach something exceptional at the end of the right turn.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I can try this as very encouraging message that it still pays off despite the great amount of data still paid, decisions to be an expert in that which you do, and risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because at the end it is not the data, but the risks associated with which you land at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you nice.</seg>
