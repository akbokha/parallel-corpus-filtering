Munich 1856 : four cards that change your view to the city
a w@@ ander An@@ st@@ alt , where young people should meet today .
a tomb chapel , where there is now excav@@ ated for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
econom@@ ists em@@ itting the former ground of pe@@ as@@ ants .
the oldest official card coin encour@@ ages exciting stories about days .
it nerv@@ es if land cards are not current .
this knows everyone who had already had to exc@@ itement , because the car @-@ Nav@@ i showed a green meadow instead of a change road .
the historical maps of the digital Bayern @-@ At@@ l@@ ases , an offer of ge@@ op@@ ort@@ isation as Bavaria of the State Government , are all other than currently - yet is therefore very reve@@ aling .
especially when you compare it with current online cards .
then it is evident that cities and municipalities in the area of the Munich Merk@@ ur have changed since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern Atlas is a fli@@ ck@@ ry , which is not equal to such as such .
in the great overview map for towns and communities , detailed maps , so @-@ called primary data sheets were incorporated .
this originated in accordance with the Bavarian survey@@ ing Administration between 1810 and 1864 , and ski@@ p the first survey of Bay@@ erns .
your principal : Napoleon .
the French army leader Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second coalition war with Austria .
Napoleon wanted a survey of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographic survey of Bay@@ erns in order - of course for military purposes .
finally , when the French troops entered the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville of 9 February 1801 , they were the present neigh@@ bors who created the idea of a surface of Bavaria map .
Kur@@ für@@ st Max IV . Joseph drove the project further , and founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - making the Bavarian survey@@ ing management .
the programme for Munich comes from the year 1856 and is like to find all the others on the Bavarian State Library .
the comparison of early / Today is the example of the state capital at the most impressive .
the city has expanded into all directions and has grown .
one example is sub@@ send@@ ling that is still relatively isolated in the map of 1856 .
S@@ end@@ ling was born 21 years after the production of the map , i.e. 1877 , in Munich district .
today Unter@@ send@@ ling is located right in the middle of the city .
the houses are concentrated along the present Pl@@ ing@@ ans@@ erst@@ raße in 1856 , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ ans@@ er , a leader of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where today the West@@ park is , you can see nothing as a fields - at first sight : a smaller card with dozens of lines and numbers : handwritten entries from the so @-@ called &quot; Ur@@ als &quot; which was derived from the basic tax .
&quot; &quot; &quot; small plots there are no farmers there today - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land in Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large green area is characterized by the north of Unter@@ send@@ ling .
the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 1810 , was a meadow of the Oktober@@ fest since 1810 , was still a meadow , and no concrete bust .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historic map shows an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the prehistoric site Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen in the area of today &apos;s district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen not only the street name &quot; on the fan &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; w@@ ander An@@ st@@ alt . &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ we@@ straße , man encoun@@ tered people with mad@@ ness .
there was in 1858 / 59 the Munich Circle @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; On the Au@@ er fan . &quot;
in 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von G@@ ud@@ den managed the institution - the psychiat@@ rist who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was advanced for his time and finished for example the c@@ rank@@ ings of the so @-@ known . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , he has also taught the staff to apply violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Museum of Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who has joined an exhibition with the An@@ st@@ alt .
for 280 patients first place was first place , and later was expanded to 500 places .
sometime , this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the Kreis@@ ir@@ ren@@ anstalt in hair 1905 .
since 2006 Is@@ ar @-@ A@@ MP@@ ER @-@ Klin@@ ikum München @-@ Ost is one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ rist of Germany .
at the area of the former Au@@ er An@@ st@@ alt , young people meet in Munich Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um .
the order acquired the building complex in 1920 , and walked in a youth house with training .
west is the football field of TS@@ V Munich East , east of residential houses from the 1980s .
in 2015 , the children @-@ house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; - built in architectural re@@ jection to the origin of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt who had been destroyed during World War II .
the Marien@@ platz was ranked as &quot; main square &quot; in 1856 , the Kauf@@ ing@@ erst@@ raße was called &quot; Kauf@@ inger Gasse . &quot;
a decisive change brought the Second World War in the heart of Munich .
the bombs of the Al@@ lies broke many holes in the city in December 1944 .
a big stayed until today - on Mari@@ enhof .
the English Institute , small business houses and a tomb chapel from the Middle Ages were once again at Mari@@ enhof , where this day will work on and on April 5 , 2017 , for the second S @-@ Bahn route .
with the sli@@ der , the old Munich map is to compare with the aerial photograph of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof .
citizen of rights published for Missouri
the National Association for the Promotion of coloured glass has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Missouri due to the discrimination policy and the rac@@ ist attacks of the state to Missouri .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory Board for the State of Missouri , which is to enter into force on August 28 , 2017 , calls for af@@ ro @-@ American trav@@ ellers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans , as a series of frag@@ mented inci@@ dents in the entire state , and here noted , &quot; says it in the opinion of the Group .
a recent law of Missouri , which makes people heavier , discrimination and discrimination of state , which un@@ disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ate on min@@ orities , ple@@ ases the group that travel to travel , said the NA@@ AC@@ P .
&quot; you have injuries of the civil rights to happen people .
they will stick together because of their skin colour , they will be beaten or killed , &quot; said the President of the Missouri NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , the Kansas City Star .
&quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet . &quot;
it is the first such warning , which has issued the organization for a state in the USA .
the group cited inci@@ dents like rac@@ ist insur@@ rection against black students at the University of Missouri and death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee .
at the beginning of the year , S@@ anders died in the beginning of the year after he had no petrol during the journey through the state of Missouri and was charged with the police of Missouri .
the Council also shows a recent report by the Office of the Secretary @-@ General of Missouri in which black drivers will be more common than white by the state in the state 75 percent .
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware of people and their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri , &quot; said Chapel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must be ready to bring it out of the country or to know their relatives to travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2015 , in 2015 , 100 Hass@@ elt , according to the latest figures from the FB@@ I report of the FB@@ I , which resulted in the state regarding the number of such injuries on the 16 . rank of the country .
the trav@@ eller is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to acc@@ use a company for home or employment discrimination .
previously , the American Civil @-@ Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) had published travel distances for Texas and Arizona , issued by the States immig@@ ration authorities to ple@@ ad people because of immig@@ ration violations , which will contribute to the view of AC@@ L@@ U to further pro@@ filing .
travel distances are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but in recent times , stak@@ eholder groups have been involved in response to certain laws and trends within the USA .
wei@@ rd project is Elem@@ ental
the Fisch@@ erb@@ acher Wei@@ dez@@ v@@ n project is a success project and is continued in the coming year .
the CDU German Bundestag ( German ) Peter White and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac have a painting in front of the village .
at the Recht@@ excav@@ ation of the family Schwen@@ de@@ mann met representatives of the CDU of CDU @-@ City Associ@@ ations together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two M@@ EP@@ s .
Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann granted first in@@ sights into his operation , in which he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest far@@ med , 40 dairy cows and also lots of young animals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; Black Forest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the alternative market for the milk of his cows , sw@@ ing@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ ths there is exclusively regional .
since he is also called BL@@ HV @-@ President of Fisch@@ erb@@ ach , he called the electric fence as &quot; Elem@@ ental &quot; .
I can not produce steep surfaces on der@@ art steep surfaces .
the green area care for a lot of work , a lot to be processed with the engine sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have here to fight with the terms and with the top@@ ography &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 , he took over the el@@ dest operation and joined this without chemical plant protection and fertilizer , even if it lead no bio@@ operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the commune has recognized the meaning of the electric fence and is happy about the leader promotion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare , the farmers should be supported .
you hope that the surface of the surfaces could be pulled out for a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest treasure we have , are the people who work in agriculture and are thinking about how they continue their operation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stressed the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the farmers are often involved in criticism
a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013 .
the dis@@ covering surface amounts to 40 hectares that are not permitted until at least 2023 .
of the total cost of 71 500 euros , half of the leader was funded , a quarter contributed by the community of Fisch@@ erb@@ ach .
thus , the farmers had to invest 12 610 euros , which they had to invest in 16,@@ 2 kilometers .
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; declared Schwen@@ de@@ mann .
K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; you do not make a good job , without farmers and past@@ ures it doesn &apos;t go . &quot;
also for Peter White : &quot; the best food is produced here . &quot;
the rural districts ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg enables the state subsi@@ dies of women &apos;s tough .
the objective is the dis@@ closure of the Black Forest .
a pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ ite is the presence of one of the L@@ PR @-@ drawn conveyor system .
in addition , the fenced area must not be bad ( Hang@@ ing til@@ t above 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened with the collection .
for the 2018 Fisch@@ erb@@ acher Wei@@ fence project 2018 , the application of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build 16 kilometres fence .
the dis@@ closure area corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros .
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump takes up the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans estimate the same as any other as any other - so the overthrow of Saddam Hussein was staged at the Fir@@ dos square in Bagh@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump regime , knew what he did when he did a symbolic Ax@@ t in a heated battle with Jim A@@ co@@ sta of CN@@ N over the proposals of the dra@@ stic reduction of the legal immig@@ ration to the Statue of Liberty .
to stay fair , Miller handle not the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of Bo@@ ys and Liberty Im@@ it@@ ators met him if he had done it .
but he took hold of their significance , and especially the significance that you were attributed to Emma Lazarus in 1903 , 17 years after completion of the monument , its base was added .
when Miller A@@ co@@ sta writes : &quot; I don &apos;t want to enter a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that ligh@@ tens the world .
the po@@ em , which you refer to which later added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
Miller is true properly , but how he formulated it , doesn &apos;t really go about history .
it &apos;s about contemporary reson@@ ance at Lazarus , the only one who invites not only any old immig@@ rants , but the p@@ oo@@ rest of the poor : &quot; your rub@@ b@@ ish , your poor , and your op@@ pressed crow@@ ds , which are ready to bre@@ athe out , and the needy out of your rich coasts . &quot;
there was never a time to see in the &quot; el@@ ong@@ ating waste &quot; on our screens .
Miller had not been engaged in literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ um@@ ps USA .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural meditation : it is indeed a conflict with the importance of America .
Lazarus - and her friends who have committed themselves to place their words and their death on the basis - did very good that they had a high political action .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and amer@@ ican rep@@ ublic@@ ism , in an un@@ used classical photo depic@@ tion the female em@@ bo@@ di@@ ment of freedom .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her po@@ em is the female figure no more abstract - she has received a voice .
and they himself gives itself another name : mother of Ex@@ il@@ ions .
the connection of the po@@ em with the picture is a brilliant femin@@ ist cou@@ p and a devastating attack on the US Nati@@ vis@@ m .
and just as Lazarus changed the significance of the statue , people wanted to change the people from the right wing .
the great write as Rush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argu@@ ed 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was dischar@@ ged , but rather a early neo @-@ conservative , the American flame goes into the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty continues .
it should carry the tor@@ ch of the freedom from the United States in the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch should not shine the way into the United States . &quot;
quite unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh here on something exposed .
the importance of the statue is quite and a question of the standing perception .
the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus existed in them to see how they were seen from exhau@@ sted , but hop@@ eful people after long and often horri@@ ble travel on the de@@ cks of ships was seen .
it is in the true sense of this , the world from a perspective of people who seek refuge and improve their lives .
their statue says to them the words of hope and of the welcome you have to hear .
and this is not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump ever wanted to know .
their tor@@ ch shall not shine the way , but the hat@@ red , which is the only source of power , ign@@ ites .
world Cup 2017 : Neil Black is Scottish members of the United Kingdom
Eil@@ id@@ h Do@@ yle remembered a time when two sh@@ all@@ ots belonged to the UK team .
the performance director of the United Kingdom , Neil Black , says that the 16 @-@ strong Scottish cont@@ ingent of the World Championship will aff@@ ord a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London in 2017 , starting on Friday .
black believes that &quot; in Scotland has developed something special &quot; and the athlet@@ ics of the United Kingdom has to learn anything from it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it , and we try to understand it , and we will take it , until we &apos;ll need to figure out &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I say with people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think that it has something to do with what they did .
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they did .
British Athlet@@ ics : it has something to do with what they did .
and also with the type on the street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are med@@ alli@@ len candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - who compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m circuit , while Eil@@ id@@ h Do@@ yle was chosen from the team to the team .
&quot; Eil@@ id@@ h is quite modest .
their capit@@ als was incredible , &quot; says Black .
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or , wherever they live or exercise , went out of room and felt very motiv@@ ated and were very motiv@@ ated .
the passion and the real feeling , the Eil@@ id@@ h , of course , were great . &quot;
the Commonwealth Silver med@@ alli@@ sts who will compete in its fifth world championships at the 400 @-@ m hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; unbeliev@@ ably &quot; that 16 Cl@@ ots are in the British team .
the best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were achieved in 1983 and 2015 .
the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mu@@ ir &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reaches five British and two European records in the past year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will participate in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , the 1,500 m running , is another Scot@@ s@@ man , who is looking for a great season , showing the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games .
Do@@ yle remembered her first world championships , when the only other Scot@@ s@@ man was in the team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell .
the Mannheim capit@@ ul@@ tural change says that they are &quot; enorm@@ ously &quot; to the fact that many of its coun@@ try@@ men are not only belong to the team , but in some cases also with the medals and the final .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so that they voted to be the team in fact that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so that we have voted great honour for me , but to know that my team mates have voted for me and voted me something very special for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously I &apos;m very proud of all the sh@@ all@@ ots that belong to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows just how far we came .
and they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to climb on po@@ res .
what my speech is concerned in capit@@ als ?
yes , I think it went well .
I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home World Championship .
so it is really important to use this home support and to benefit from that we are back at the Olympiastadion .
I get a second chance to go and compete , and it &apos;s just a great atmosphere at the outside . &quot;
block from critics on Facebook : do not get you a public position when you do not manage to prevent elec@@ tors .
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the newspapers beat him because of the inner policy until his political principles .
he sh@@ ook at the cr@@ iti@@ que , safe .
but he didn &apos;t put his critics to silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because in 1783 Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the spe@@ ech@@ ism can be taken away - and , sil@@ ly and dum@@ b , we are led like the sheep to the battles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this brings me to Maryland to Govern@@ or Larry H@@ og@@ an , who needs to work more like Washington .
H@@ og@@ ans employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union def@@ endants him in the beginning of this week .
the staff of the Govern@@ ors dismissed the law@@ suit as fri@@ vol@@ utions , and the online comment was full of a counter @-@ action with &quot; Na , and ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s only Facebook &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said many people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important if it is a type like H@@ og@@ an .
this is a republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazing .
he has the second highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a re@@ ac@@ tionary heat head .
he has shown a fixed hand at the leadership of his state and strict compliance with principles .
he was also very sk@@ ill@@ ful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect to his elec@@ tors and to de@@ pl@@ ating his hair@@ less head after chemotherapy on his side .
therefore , the blocking of persons who come to the side of the govern@@ ors - which is a public forum , which is officially designated and of employees that are paid by public tax @-@ Dollars - un@@ necessary and finally dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post def@@ ended H@@ og@@ ans spokes@@ person Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse def@@ ended the actions of the govern@@ ors and argu@@ ed that the blocking of comments is nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it is too easy to use the picture of wheels or chambers or water filled people using the wh@@ ip converter .
the Post spoke with some of the people who were blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
and that are only real people who speak with their chosen leaders : a teacher , a business@@ man and a priest , no tro@@ ll@@ s .
they all said that their comments resp@@ ect@@ ful , thinking and not prof@@ ited .
the priest quoted the Bible in his post and app@@ eals to H@@ og@@ an Catholic faith .
lawyer in Lak@@ sh@@ mi &apos;s Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani von Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not h@@ ass@@ y , but she asked them to hate Hass@@ elt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction in Hass@@ elt and other current news , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote in the language range of the news &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Post &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think this idea , if a number of people in the same topic takes place , then they are considered as so @-@ called collective use and not recognized as a major group of people affected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what the employees of the governor as &quot; concentrated spam @-@ attack , &quot; would other likely be &quot; inter@@ c@@ ession . &quot;
the fac@@ ebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply deleted a critic or negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in previous time , when you have done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn with critical lad@@ ders and to burn or dis@@ cord to silence .
but just that happens in digital .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public officials , which critic@@ ises that he has implic@@ it on Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is pro@@ claim from Twitter users , blocked by his Twitter Feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question fell last week in Virginia .
the chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County passed the First A@@ ji@@ ment , according to the U.S. District Judge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when she named a voters from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Govern@@ or Matt Before ( R ) also received a visit from AC@@ L@@ U because of his use of Facebook and Twitter .
this should not be so hard .
at the moment of Washington , the time of affordable Por@@ tos had a similar effect as the internet .
the number of newspapers multiply between 1776 and 1800 , and an anonymous letter stroke on his lead .
and even then Washington had anonymous Tro@@ l@@ le .
the people , pseud@@ onym@@ s like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius , &quot; and &quot; Por@@ ti@@ us &quot; wrote to all letters to newspapers that made war decisions .
pet@@ itions that have been awarded its Stand@@ point on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , Trade and shipping with Great Britain critic@@ ised his position , according to the historical documents , which were collected by the online Pap@@ ers of George Washington Project .
but he didn &apos;t put them to silence .
expression , expression and dis@@ courses belong to the basis of our nation .
and true guide means to accept that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes on domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club
former Europeans no . 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope in the next three days of local comfort since the Renaissance Club in East Loth@@ ian hosted the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who led in the past year by the Ar@@ cher@@ field links to the end , before being connected to Paul E@@ ales , joined the new venue and performs as a tournament ambassador in the name of the founder and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ v@@ adi .
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he reached his fame in this event , &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty .
&quot; the players will see this course from his best side , it is in a great condition .
Jerry has made a great job when he put this place .
he is a je@@ al@@ ger suppor@@ ter of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great show@@ case for this course . &quot;
the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defend a championship for the first time , although he won in his 32 @-@ year career both at the European Tour as well as the European Tour Tour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this really feels really interested , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said in South@@ port , players &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I did not defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura Open because they had won it in the year after I won it from the program .
back to this part of the world is magic .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories from the last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon , last year here .
it was a really special time and one that we always appreciate . &quot;
Gary OR@@ R , who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50th birthday this year , returns to the promotion at home .
this event will be his first Scottish gig since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s always a bit more when you play at home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said OR@@ R , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you want to make it well , but you feel no additional print .
I really enjoyed it to play , and I played a solid golf course .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad about how far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the trio on the field , the former Masters winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and the senior leader Paul Bro@@ adh@@ ur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ asked .
OR@@ R and the former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce belong to the six sh@@ all@@ ots on the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ bra@@ ir and Ross Dr@@ um@@ mond .
admission is free , the parking lot costs £ 5 per car with a occup@@ ants and £ 10 per car with two or more occup@@ ants .
all revenues go to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less lung cancer by passive smoking
in the past two decades , less people have died because of passive bre@@ aches of lung cancer .
scientists come to this result of the university hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 167 lung cancer cases increased to passive smoking per year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Director of Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison , he moved to this subject to this topic of 1994 .
at that time , there were still 400 lung cancer cases because of passive bre@@ aches each year in Germany .
the new study is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
house@@ keeping ass@@ essing themselves as a complex
construction works in the Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and &quot; are reas@@ onably in the time , &quot; the director of the building station Fred Hein@@ ze .
in the area of house connections , the location is more complicated than expected , as in the bottom of the ground , what is not noted in the plans .
the traffic , which is always adapted to the construction work , provides a large problem for the construction ru@@ pp of the company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ignor@@ ance of motor@@ ists from red lights and shut@@ down is enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road is closed and only the buses are allowed to enter the passage .
Angelo Car@@ uso , Marvin Kost@@ or@@ z and Tim Kost@@ or@@ z by the company St@@ ump@@ p has been working with the work on the bridge since weeks .

they even uses rarely a sau@@ cep@@ an .

after half an hour , the c@@ asserole dish is taken from fri@@ es , un@@ washed hands and swal@@ lowed up .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the L@@ ehm@@ floor - it has no furniture - where she also carries her daily work , such as clothes with tr@@ ash water from the nearby sum@@ p .

as the youngest of four wives of their husband , their fields were assigned .
poly@@ gam@@ ie is common here .
of course it can be too dangerous , the majority of the vill@@ agers are unemployed , and many drink it , and there are the soldiers here .
&quot; nobody w@@ att@@ ing it , after 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; says it .
it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was taken in 1969 according to an controversi@@ al referendum in Indonesia when only 1,0@@ 26 elderly people should vote against the occupying troops .
an existing movement that ran for independence against Dutch rule , turned and turned to the government of Jakarta that maintains control of the region and foreign journalists or legal observ@@ ations of it .
in 2003 the province was officially divided in Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , with the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea as the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as long as it is desert . the journey includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the province of Jay@@ u@@ ura and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the car rental .
there is no public transportation .
the city with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants is composed of wooden houses , which are surrounded by bam@@ bo@@ o tubes , and made of corrugated ro@@ ofs that were converted by rust in different yellow tones .
only very few In@@ som@@ ier have made their journey here , welded for journalists and practically no foreigners .

Pap@@ ua is in@@ don@@ esi@@ ast@@ est province , where 28 % of people live under the poverty line and some of the worst child mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also In@@ don@@ esi@@ ens Gold@@ land .
the largest and profitable gold mine of the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located just 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a sky@@ scra@@ per in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort has dismant@@ led the value of 3.1 billion US dollars of gold and copper .
in addition , Pap@@ ua has more than wood resources , valued at estimated $ 78 billion .
however , these riches are a source of mis@@ ery for the Pap@@ ua that ensure that In@@ don@@ esi@@ ens has preserved a first presence of the military .
an investigation was reported in 2005 in the New York Times that Fre@@ ep@@ ort local military personnel and units paid almost 20 million US dollars , including up to 150,000 US dollars to a single officer .
Pap@@ u@@ ic claims based on greater autonomy thre@@ aten these gold and are treated gn@@ ashing .
according to activists , more than 500,000 Pap@@ ua has been killed and thousands were ra@@ ped and imprisoned since 1969 by the Indonesian military .
mass@@ acres in Pap@@ u@@ as St@@ es@@ High@@ land in the 1970 @-@ s became genocide in accordance with the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission .
in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peace@@ fully demonstr@@ ators in the region alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; name in a report of the Erz@@ di@@ ö@@ z@@ ese Brisbane from the year 2016 , in which reports about Gr@@ äu@@ ble actions of the previous year are particularly popular - and the brutal precip@@ itation of peaceful demonstrations are particularly popular . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims that happen every week , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia @-@ researcher for Human Rights Watch .
the screws have strengthened , since Pap@@ u@@ as resources had to bring an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of In@@ don@@ esi@@ ia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is at 83 % Christian , but the demo@@ graphic development changes , since Muslim companies come from the most populated islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra , and Sul@@ aw@@ esi .

&quot; migrants have started to sell h@@ ens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Pap@@ ua explains , &quot; A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai Local , who moved to work in the province of Jay@@ u@@ ura .
&quot; it has the native Pap@@ ua - the Mama @-@ Mama &#91; the women &#93; of Pap@@ ua - their market . &quot;
the in@@ dones@@ ian President J@@ oko Wi@@ do@@ do , known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , spoke during his election campaign in 2014 , spoke to the ine@@ qualities and legal violations in Pap@@ ua .
the former Zimmermann assured 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jakarta .
but in Pap@@ ua has changed little , and today the loc@@ als feel betrayed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts are broken because we have approved 2014 for Jok@@ ow@@ i , with the anticip@@ ation that he will fulfill our hopes that the justice will be restored &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says You . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is &apos;s inauguration in October .
on 7 December 2014 , a group of 11 children was outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols before a bon@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke out on a motorcycle by the darkness .
the fri@@ gh@@ ted children told them that they should switch their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers took part in their tone , and later came back to four soldiers , the local Pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk , pursued and struck the group with their def@@ ensive compounds , victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
one child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ eim@@ o , was so difficult that he fell into the coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was put into fire , and the things es@@ cal@@ ated on the next day .
about 1,000 young par@@ ua men , women and children gathered themselves together on a football pitch in front of the local police station and the Military Command Center to demand justice .
they were cr@@ ushed and conducted the Wa@@ ita dance - in the circle passing and a bird @-@ sigh@@ ting - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ Stamm .
some demonstr@@ ators began stones at police and military posts .
when the atmosphere was heated , the soldiers was sent over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses have more than three times resistance , they shoot her dead , &quot; says it in an official document of TI@@ ME , which was not released to local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ four@@ t@@ els of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , looked at the threatened risk and called for peace and ur@@ ged the crowd to return home .
nobody was listening in the mood .
&quot; when I turned back , I was shot in my left hand , &quot; he said to TI@@ ME on the veranda of his colorful wooden house .
k@@ ay@@ ev still doesn &apos;t know who has been fired , but says that the ball came out of the rows of the soldiers assembled here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was crow@@ ded , many shots were fired , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he adds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his c@@ ousin , the witness of shooting was .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I went to him and sought his body to make sure that he was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who carries only a name , the TI@@ ME in dark mood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kissed him . &quot;
the Chief Financial District of the Pap@@ ua @-@ Police , Y@@ ot@@ je M@@ ende , said repor@@ ters that his officers wanted to get their station only &quot; back &quot; because it is attacked .
&quot; we have to defend us if people threatened to kill us , &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua @-@ Police , Commissioner Pud@@ jo Su@@ li@@ sti@@ yo , in 2015 .
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
according to human Rights Watch five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many more injured .
the news about the red@@ ness came only on the following day &apos; filtered &apos; to Jakarta .
three weeks j@@ ok@@ ow@@ i held an passionate speech in Jay@@ u@@ ura , in which he expressed sympath@@ ies for the families of the victims , and s@@ ware to tackle the historic abuse in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want that this case will be solved immediately , so it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
security Minister En@@ anto said in October 2016 that he in@@ viol@@ ate an extra@@ judicial mechanism to the side of historical human rights violations .
but the expul@@ sion began almost immediately .
&quot; most injuries occurred in long time .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and beginning of the 2000 @-@ s years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed us to tackle these verses , but there are processes that have to pass through , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then , Wir@@ anto did a retreat when he spoke on June 5 in Jakarta with TI@@ ME and said he has no plans to set up an appeal mechanism in Pap@@ ua .
instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Wir@@ anto , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; charged by the UN for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which demanded more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody independence of 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses were already buried in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai occurr@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims took such alleg@@ ations with fierce un@@ belief .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes .
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that he still lives in fear in years later .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; says he .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am afraid of being arrested by the military , I &apos;m afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says that he was defeated by the military , after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I had buried the bodies , the military sought to me , &quot; he says .
the shooting ries have not ceased .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police on the village of vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighbourhood D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
during a con@@ front@@ ation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ en@@ ma who refused to bring an un@@ conscious man to hospital , a person and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , who was dr@@ unken 24 @-@ year old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was dr@@ unken when he died in a nearby river f@@ ished , died on the way to the hospital .
in front of the firm inhabitants of the company , protest@@ ers protest@@ ers in front of the company &apos;s office .
the police said that the vill@@ agers had cast stones on officers who re@@ acted by taking warning signs .
but loc@@ als say that the mobile Brigade ( Indonesian par@@ amil@@ itary police ) began to shoot at the quantity and killing one .
&quot; we were so in pan@@ ic , we have anxi@@ ety that there is ven@@ geance , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u B@@ adi@@ i who lives in the vicinity of the hospital and witness how the last one has been delivered quickly , the TI@@ ME .
&quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot;
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai Parliament called to move officers to the account and move the mobile Brigade of the police from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always an un@@ resting place for Indonesian government .
the lack of sens@@ ory development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the family members of Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and Dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua .
many closed the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the re@@ bel army that claims to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua by doing spor@@ adic attacks and det@@ ach@@ ings of Indonesian soldiers .
some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , among them T@@ adi@@ us Y@@ og@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ oya .
in response to thousands of people in pan@@ i@@ ai , thousands of people were arrested and arbitr@@ arily taken in custody under the pre@@ text of the &quot; backup of the national sover@@ eig@@ n@@ ty . &quot;
some never dive again .
Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as a trag@@ ic@@ onic place among people in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
poverty strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice , which is sold in du@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , is too expensive for loc@@ als .
bread is just beyond the range .
people here build everything that they eat : especially Not@@ a and fruit and leaf vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of sweet potatoes .
they kept most of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of emergency spare only 10.000 in@@ dones@@ ian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 C@@ ents ) .
in the course of time , economic im@@ balance between the native Pap@@ ua and the new migrants have grown , which have arrived in greater number since the opening of new flight routes to the airport of Nab@@ ire .
the few jobs that are in the region are usually going to the better educ@@ ated and prosper@@ ity of migrants .
pap@@ ua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to competitive their own company competitive .
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there is no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the headquarters of Pan@@ i@@ ai .
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
in addition , restrictions of the coverage of international media are e@@ ager@@ ly awa@@ ited .
at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ das and Bas@@ ille Long@@ ch@@ amp were deported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although the rare permission was given to the film .
according to Ph@@ el@@ im K@@ ine , the Deputy Asia @-@ Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is election campaign have been promoting the restrictions of reporting to promote transparency and development .
&quot; there are new d@@ angers of foreign journalists who try to report from In@@ don@@ esi@@ ze un@@ quiet in the most peaceful provinces of Pap@@ ua and West@@ pap@@ ua : visa de@@ ref@@ usal and a black list , &quot; he said in a statement .
lack of press control means that the international pressure on Indonesian government remains limited to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March , six pairs of Pacific countries - Tong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Mar@@ sh@@ all@@ ine and the Salom@@ ons Islands - the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and far more common injuries &quot; in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai sli@@ der .
the same countries have historically supported the O@@ PM .
the spokes@@ person for the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha Nas@@ ir proved the alleg@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jakarta : &quot; in Indonesia , there is still a democratic system , and there are free media , so it is difficult to refuse the evidence of human rights issues . &quot;
people who want to know more foreign governments should know this .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of the human right @-@ ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ u@@ ura visited him and ur@@ ged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that took part in the session but anonymous would remain .
Indonesia has an additional presidential election , but the Pap@@ ua will tell that they probably won &apos;t be back for Jok@@ ow@@ i .
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good inten@@ tions , but he is involved by people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ guns , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the Chief Council .
he wants that Jok@@ ow@@ i know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from that it is living under the permanent threat of an Egyptian military , is located in poverty and health services .
Gob@@ i says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , such as other Pap@@ ua , will consider their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; debt &quot; which he must rep@@ ay .
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they want only righteousness , &quot; says he .
despite the thre@@ ats and en@@ rol@@ ment , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Sh@@ uss@@ ars led a final symbolic act of Des@@ p@@ ite : the suffering of a sacrifice was buried on a complex opposite the police and military station .
they may know that they may never come to righteousness , but at least they don &apos;t forget their crimes against humanity .
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with a prisoner head .
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; Wol@@ k@@ enk@@ rat@@ zer of Dubai for the second time
a fire found on Friday in one of the highest living towers of the world in Dubai on his di@@ alog@@ y and forced hundreds of residents , from the 337 meters high , 79 @-@ storey building .
it is the second fire that h@@ ates in just two years by the high @-@ house , which is called random the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) .
the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word through the cause of the flame .
&quot; we slept and we went up with the fire alarm and the cry of the people .
we crossed the steps down and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50th floor to bottom , &quot; telling a resident who named George ang@@ ab , Reuters .
Dub@@ ais civil protection authorities told that the units of fire fighting charges against 4.00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 GMT ) the fire extingu@@ ished and the building cool .
the government said that they work on the provision of accommodations for the person concerned .
the incident may have questions about the safety of materials that are used in outdoor areas around the world , revi@@ ve .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch @-@ building according to the fire in 2015 revealed that the biggest part of the damages caused by a covering , outer covering for decoration or insulation .
in Britain , the police , they believe that the system of plates for insulation and covering in the London Gren@@ ade Tower in June may have contributed to the spread of a sector in which about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International Tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) has fallen by the General Davis Cup Cou@@ p at the Annual General Meeting .
at the meeting in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , the only two @-@ third majority are not supported for this sport revolutionary proposal , Davis Cup individual are not only supported by the two @-@ third majority .
although often very long , but even so very estimated five @-@ sentence classi@@ cs remain so long to the traditional competition .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 percent of affili@@ ates agreed for reform , the goal of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty , therefore only barely missed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision , but they are disappointed that our members have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these i@@ kon@@ os and historic competitions , &quot; Hag@@ ger@@ ty .
one will continue to work to improve the applic@@ ability .
not only for the vote , after many inv@@ ade before the proposal , the final has come to a neutral place .
new from 2018 can only be compar@@ atively smaller details : the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will continue in the subsequent year during the first round .
in order to reduce the costs for organizers , the requirements are facilit@@ ated in terms of training places , etc. and players will need to complete the official media events before the Davis Cup .
more than 1 of 5 US travelers bringing forbidden items into the plane , finds a survey
a survey conducted by the passengers that more than 20 percent are aware of deliber@@ ately connected items to the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 per cent , which bore the plane , while they acci@@ dentally wore knives or other objects with blades .
less than 1 percent claimed , they would have discovered that they travelled ast@@ ray with weapons , am@@ mun@@ ition or explo@@ si@@ ves .
the survey carried out more than 1,000 people - that was carried out by a jet Char@@ ter@@ service , the Strat@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , it was also noted that younger trav@@ ellers rather susp@@ ects the rules .
of those surveyed that they are ignor@@ ant that they are ignor@@ ant to fly with something that was banned by the T@@ SA was 19.@@ 7 percent mill@@ enni@@ als , compared to less than 15 percent , the members of the generation X were .
the most common items such as T@@ SA agents have been deliber@@ ately illustrated , food and liquids were added .
more than 3 per cent said to be ignor@@ able items with clin@@ ations carried by security control while 2.2 percent of women respon@@ dents and 3.7 percent of the male respon@@ dents have confirmed that they had already been killed in the plane .
the company said that they were inter@@ ro@@ gated throughout the country to find out how many acci@@ dentally sm@@ ug@@ ged dirt by the airport security , and how many are they had been deliber@@ ately done .
it is no surprise that people who are gu@@ ill@@ ful , are ignor@@ ant or ignor@@ ance - by security , those who were most frequently flying .
however , the company indicates that the T@@ SA guidelines are slightly complicated and conf@@ using .
humans are often un@@ certain which liquids can take them , or how much of it .
it is therefore no surprise that the largest amount of objects conf@@ used by the T@@ SA conf@@ used liquids .
for long time the people thought to view T@@ SA could be books as Schm@@ ug@@ gel@@ ware .
liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k is it no matter : tens of thousands of Tesla clients cancel order
electric thous@@ and@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k returns with the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tesla &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
he has so far under@@ beat that a part of the customer has withdrawn its non @-@ binding reservation back again .
in addition to the always triumph@@ al numbers to increase sales improvements , Tesla boss El@@ on Mus@@ k has betrayed another , less smooth number : the cancellations made by the new mass market 3 .
Mus@@ k had frequently asked more than 500,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car with more than 500,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car .
in fact Mus@@ k had a total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders , 63@@ .000 have been withdrawn again .
critics had always been pointed out that it is only a non @-@ binding reservations .
in case of cancellation , Tesla pays 1000 Euro ( in the US $ 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; booking deposit &quot; complete .
at present , there was only 45@@ 5.000 of such un@@ com@@ mitt@@ al reservations , Mus@@ k were held in a telephone conference with an@@ alysts .
so that the cancellation of around 12 percent of all orders could be used to date , the Tesla boss will not believe .
its argument : the challenge at the ambitious growth target range is not on demand , but on the production site .
last year , Tesla employs 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
by 2018 it will be all models - 500,000 - by 2020 one million .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k , there are more than 1800 bookings per day .
who today set a &quot; Model 3 &quot; in the second half of 2018 with the delivery date - when Tesla creates it to drive its n@@ ag@@ el@@ new , never during practice tested production lines without bigger interrup@@ tions with maximum capacity utilization .
many experts doub@@ ts that this is possible .
but comes in greater del@@ ays , then the op@@ ho@@ bia could become a problem for Tesla .
for then , the company cannot be dis@@ satisfied with customer &apos;s satisfied customers in dro@@ ves .
EPA CEO P@@ ru@@ ction is moving back to emissions of the Obama @-@ Er@@ a rules to reduce emissions
one day after he was accused of 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ zzo , chief of the environmental protection authority , his former decision , to prevent the implementation of the rules of the Obama era to reduce emissions Smo@@ g caused by air pollutants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented its change , when his agency proved the needs of the state environmental authorities compared to recur@@ ring power than previous administration .
he did not mention the law@@ suit against his prior position in a Federal Court of Appeal .
it goes around a deadline that ran on 1 October for states to comply with the standards of 2015 for under@@ floor ozone .
in June , P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he will not hesitate to give his authority to study the plan to study the plan and to avoid the plan in local decisions or economic growth . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump , prosec@@ utor of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , was a long time a reliable ad@@ missible field of environmental protection regulations .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ d has repeatedly passed over to block regul@@ ators , to block the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels .
the sudden return of Wednesday is the youngest legal way for the P@@ ru@@ ction regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
last month , a Federal Appeals Court decided that the EPA @-@ transg@@ ress@@ ors has exceeded its authority , as he tried to regul@@ ate the implementation of a rule of Obama administration , the oil and gas companies for monitoring and reduction of methane .
in one on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ ff suggested that his K@@ ehr@@ an at ozone standards just simply put the read@@ iness of the EPA to cooperation with the countries through the complex process of con@@ tim@@ ely ful@@ fill@@ ment of the new standards .
&quot; under previous administration , the EPA often have often maintained the dead@@ lines for performing and then maintained to conduct of activists and others , and in an agreement to carry out the date for carrying out , &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt , who accused the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job .
&quot; we don &apos;t believe in a regulation through jurisdiction , and we accept them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and authority that gives it to us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the opinion of the EPA that P@@ ru@@ ction sometime had its &quot; powers to delay and all other trade@@ marks were used to ensure that the regulations are based on a solid politics and the best available information . &quot;
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in the Congress is entitled to a comprehensive revision of the ozone rules .
one of the last month of approval bill , the implementation of the rules of 2015 should be delayed by at least eight years .
the measure was not yet completed in the Senate .
the New York Secretary General , Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the Coalition led to the Coalition led to the EPA in this week , said the group intended to justi@@ fy the legal pressure .
&quot; the return of the EPA - according to our cl@@ ams - is an important profit for the health and security of these 6.7 million new Yor@@ kers and the more than 115 million Americans that are affected directly from the smo@@ g , &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man .

&quot; it is anno@@ ying , how much pressure does it need to bre@@ athe this reasonable step from the person responsible for the protection of the air which we bre@@ athe &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from Center for Bi@@ ological Diversity .

a gent@@ lem@@ an , who built a church , took place , and he remained with a priest , remained the owner of this church , and was able to inherit the owner of this church .
this was the right to use a priest or to propose a new priest by bishop .
there were three altars in the church and two bells in the tower .
the bigger of the two cr@@ um@@ ble at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell was first mentioned in 16@@ 92 but later had to be released in the Second World War in 1942 .
in the Thir@@ ty Years War ( 16@@ 16 to 1648 ) the window discs were moved and the bells were stolen .
the roof was un@@ dense .
in 1796 French troops camp@@ ed near the church .
they removed the pul@@ pit and the church bases , and used it as a burning wood .
the remains of the church threatened to overthrow 1809 .
until 1869 the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery served as last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schwe@@ iler .
in 1823 the cemetery was expanded and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was demolished .
only the tower was left .
in the new vintage of 1834 , a storm flo@@ cked the church tower and half pl@@ ung@@ ed .
in order to prevent evil , the tower was demolished .
only the existing Dom@@ en@@ wer@@ g today still stayed as a witness of the 750 years old church history .

Verein wants to check approval from Win@@ dr@@ ä@@ s
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not see any legal foundation for the construction and is therefore turned to the land@@ lord . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; association is called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CDU ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is asked to withdraw his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ eimer N@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is illegal .
the association argu@@ ed that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in Bo@@ ish@@ eimer N@@ ette no wind turbines could have been approved because at the time in quadru@@ ple , only at the time limit to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal has existed a force concentration camp zone .
within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are possible in principle , at the same time , the concentration zone causes an exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; two different zones should have a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saving &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the landscape . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the town of Vier@@ sen had decided that a second wind concentration camp in the Bo@@ ish@@ eimer N@@ ette had decided - but they did not appro@@ ves the Düsseldorf Regional Government , because of a formation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lack of plan@@ ation is the approval of approval according to illegal and therefore , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christopher &apos;s , Chairman of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the current status of things : the City Council has decided before the summer break again the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ eimer N@@ ette ; an approval of the District government is still standing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the issu@@ ance of approval for the erection of wind turbines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circuit confirms the entrance to the entrance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letter has been received since the past week in the district &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; stated a speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circuit takes you to the occasion to test the matter again .
but they don &apos;t lead to that the procedure will be stopped .
with a view of the running proceedings at the Administ@@ rative Court , the circle on Thursday does not want to commit to the arg@@ um@@ ery of the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot;
the NEW re , a subsidiary of NEW , is planning on an area at Bo@@ ish@@ eimer N@@ ette the construction of four per 200 meters high winds .
already last year , the company was involved in which the City of Vier@@ sen has participated in which the city is closed with the owner of about 65 hectares .
with the erection of the four wind turbines , electricity needs to be covered by around 11 400 households - this corresponds to approximately one @-@ fifth of the electricity needs of all four households .
the NEW Re intends to invest some 20 million euros .
in the last summer , four con@@ sens@@ us Stad@@ ler issued green light for the purchase of three wind turbines at the wind farm Lin@@ ni@@ ch at Aachen and participation in a wind energy plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the Hein@@ berg district .

it sailed to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy network which have taken part of the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy , the king had said in the spring .

the action under the au@@ spices of the I@@ HK and with many partners do also make clear that every citizen could affect his own body behavior itself .

tr@@ ump followed by telephone calls on telephone calls to Mexico under pressure because of payment of the limit wall
tran@@ scripts from telephone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
on January 27 , Tr@@ ump called Tr@@ ump in a phone with the Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto , to say publicly to say publicly that he would not pay for a planned limit .
the U.S. President certi@@ fies him because he had denied the wall publicly . according to reports , he said to him , &quot; You cannot tell the press . &quot;
Tr@@ ump launched its presidential campaign with the promise to establish a wall in the southern border of the United States , and s@@ ware , Mexico for the project .
tran@@ scription of his first An@@ ru@@ fs with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ table were also published and enth@@ used a cl@@ amped exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. Turn@@ Bull is that an trade for the United States immig@@ rant to assume &quot; sm@@ iling &quot; and &quot; stup@@ id , &quot; and that the existence was brought to trading by the Obama administration , as a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; would like to look like a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees in the USA .
Mr. Tr@@ ump finished the call after he had said the s@@ enti@@ als to the Lord , &quot; this is the most certainly call for the whole day . &quot;
Moo@@ res Ford massacre : activ@@ ist activ@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice again
in 1948 , Ford Mercury drove through a group of viewers in rural Monroe , Georgia , and ump@@ ed to the Ford Bridge of Moore .
before the car , the four black passengers and a white driver had to reach the bridge , a group of white men came out with ri@@ ors to block his way .
the leader of the mo@@ bs - a man of mean age in a needle strike - took a long train on its cig@@ ar and looked at the wind@@ shield .
in the inside , the occup@@ ants in fear .
&quot; we want this n -@@ --- r Roger ! &quot; ro@@ aring the man .
&quot; get him from the car ! &quot;
cri@@ es torn , silence , when a young man was broken down from the passenger seat .
fortunately this awesome scene was played on the 22nd of July , just a follow @-@ up .
but when a snare is thrown around the neck of &quot; Roger &quot; , almost all of them in the audience are very real sig@@ h .
since 2005 , Mayor &apos;s rights are back to Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge , in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com , as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - from K@@ u Kl@@ ux Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one has been indicted because of the murder .
&quot; it is really uns@@ ur@@ able that in all these years no one person was arrested - although we see them in our congregations , although we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks , who assi@@ sts in the organization of the reproduction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a dirt on a history , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bro@@ oks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old member of the state of Georgia and a life polit@@ ician .
for him , the reproduction as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual reminder of the Monroe community that has never been corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to do the termination , we want healing , we want to be reconc@@ iled , but first we have to receive justice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we cannot get healing and reconciliation until we receive justice . &quot;
a small towel puts a cloth over the dead one of the victims of the Moore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ n on 27 July 1946 .
according to FB@@ I , which were obtained by the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding compounds were suspected of the Lyn@@ ch@@ process .
but no one was charged .
although the susp@@ ects remain on free walking for decades that the double motivation for Lyn@@ ch actions were always known throughout the city : politics and sex .
in April 1946 he made a decision of the Supreme Court of the Supreme Court of Georgia to the first time in Georgia to leave their voice in the summer .
approximately at the same time as the election , according to the FB@@ I of the black Far@@ mp@@ ter Roger Mal@@ com , a white land owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - allegedly due to a woman .
Bro@@ oks said the rum@@ or in the city have been that h@@ ester have slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby she was , not of her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white Land@@ owner , 600 Dollar , to free Mal@@ com from the prison , so the FB@@ I .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her cou@@ sins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to the prison .
but when they drew from prison , the Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge , surrounded by a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b , surrounded by the car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it was found , Har@@ rison , who prepared the Mor@@ de , has prepared a FB@@ I report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is obvious that there was a lot between the government and local prosec@@ utions , which was not only involved in the murder , evidence and the identity of witnesses has promised . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bro@@ oks formulated it even more fun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a right @-@ right massacre , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you register and if you vote , then you will happen to you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for almost a decade , Cass@@ and@@ ra Gre@@ ene has led the annual follow @-@ up of the Moore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
its representation is ingen@@ ious , mature , and is justified in a kind of deeper rac@@ ism , of which many believed that he does not exist in America .
it &apos;s hard to see and even more difficult , but Gre@@ ene said that the point is .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to speak about the Lyn@@ n , because we are con@@ fron@@ ted with him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I can &apos;t build any relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I have done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year production began in June , and on the first day ur@@ ged almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest black - into a room and listen , as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ played overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is an old co @-@ director here .
he has played the role of the boss C@@ lan@@ mit@@ lia since years , but he said that the role will never be easier .
&quot; I feel dirty , because I &apos;m not so , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it is very important to receive this story of life because we don &apos;t want to return to this time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room tried the actor D@@ arri@@ us Brad@@ sh@@ aw and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , their lines .
the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the h@@ ester cri@@ es and op@@ pressed him that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said he was afraid of my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ras@@ hid answer the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone breaks out ( at least all black actors ) in Gel@@ der@@ ision .
Gre@@ ene laugh@@ s at the silent .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; asked Ras@@ cona .
he is al@@ armed and conf@@ used .
was I hard to hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; Gre@@ ene said , still k@@ not@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think that white people then &apos; n --- &apos; said &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but , &quot; funny one of the other black represent@@ ations .
&quot; you just need to hit the hard &apos; R. &apos; .
and exactly there is the energy in the room , a feeling of camera body replaces the dis@@ comfort .
everyone is busy that this is true , not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene starts again .
this time , when Ras@@ cona , says the N @-@ Word , it says it sharp and with re@@ print .
absolutely no one laugh@@ s .
this repet@@ ition expi@@ res and fast .
there are cri@@ es , shots and silence .
a woman , clothed with a wedding dress , stands above the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and causes cheap holiday home &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot;
her voice breaks during each second word .
about a hundred meters above , there is a group of about four dozen people swe@@ at silence and tears from the eyes .
the audience is divided between black and white between black and white .
a pair is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many are coming down the road .
they all have lived for eight hours of Geor@@ gi@@ as , when Bro@@ oks she leads them on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
until this point the Mor@@ de has remained an ast@@ ray , but now , if one found on the same country where Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de took place , the air feels like .
if the last notes of the song , Gre@@ ene charges the quantity to come closer and insp@@ ecting the dead bodies .
children up to their heads , record the f@@ ake blood and the quiet body and whis@@ pers to each other .
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; mur@@ mu@@ red a little boy , when he would remember it .
after a few minutes thanks to Gre@@ ene the amount - and suddenly there is over .
the actor throw away the Lyn@@ ch &apos;s path and their tears .
Brad@@ sh@@ aw re@@ ar@@ ms Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit , who played the cl@@ an member .
Nick Ras@@ cona is surrounded by two of his fel@@ lows and then cri@@ es in their arms , the emotional burden of performance breaks down with him .
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; whis@@ per@@ ed one of the women .
&quot; we know that this is not in your heart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you have done this out of a reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later the audience will be together with the actors for dinner together .
at a table pl@@ au@@ ts a white pair of Atlanta excited about the reproduction with a black pair , which they have just learned .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski fought to find words which feeling the feeling the performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... of people that look like yourself , and those that do it , because they look like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what really does it do with me , that the Lyn@@ x will still pass , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , the only police shooting is called &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same space , Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks Hof holds on his table , it e@@ ats and reminds of the civil rights .
he said he had already begun to plan the performance in the next year .
&quot; the reproduction is inspir@@ ing in a way , because it describes the terror of what we have done , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said .
&quot; it &apos;s so if we learn anything from it , then it can happen again .
whoever does not study his own story , who doesn &apos;t know his own story is condemned to repeat them . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ d@@ us@@ k &quot; reconc@@ iled the Wag@@ n@@ eri@@ an in Bayreuth
in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monum@@ ental work made the director Frank Cast@@ orf at a bun@@ t @-@ fri@@ vol@@ e , a giant , six @-@ storey back@@ drop .

great appl@@ ause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows the first time on stage - in view of the great heat again in Leg@@ erer leisure .
the appearance was expected by Frank Cast@@ orf and his regional team .
in 2013 , he still had to leave the Pfei@@ f@@ concert in 2013 , there were five years later great Ju@@ bel in which the bu@@ sted &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; was interrupted .
Fest@@ spiel@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to have pleasure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we noted that the audience has grown together with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a certain way shortly before the performance of d@@ pa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audience did not only have one form of peace with Cast@@ orf but it is also an understanding of its sight .
I draw a positive conclusion .
max quantity works as volunteers .
they work in their volunte@@ er year at several places .
where everywhere ?
amount : normally in Schwein@@ furt at the furniture shop , once a week I help here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I have already worked at school at school as well .
how are your experiences yet ?
quantity : it &apos;s a nice , broad range that I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
you are now 26 years old , so a late freel@@ anc@@ er volunte@@ er .
how does that come ?
quantity : I have made high school .
and then a civil engineering , let &apos;s say successfully broken .
I recognized for me that it is the fal@@ sche for me and I want to make something else to work with people .
and then I asked me what do you do .
do a social year , there is an insight , as it is possible to see how it is on the spot , maybe it really is .
and was it so ?
quantity : I have accumulated great impressions .
I will start my studies in the winter semester .
I &apos;m going to study dual @-@ study , probably in the youth office Her@@ ne a social worker and study at Ham@@ m at the Fachhochschule .
is it not un@@ common , during the volunte@@ er service have several different types of applications ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it &apos;s always on it , where one makes his FS@@ J .
it is possible to work from the anti@@ sheim to youth - in all possible facets of the social work .
with me it was very varied .
I was also partially in the stove , so in the afternoon care .
for me , this was exactly the right thing that prov@@ oked me .
I could recognize my own strengths and see how it really expi@@ res .
different than in civil engineering studies ?
quantity : well , here it does not get to count St@@ ati@@ ques .
it is always other people of the head , each have a very different story behind .
whether a refugee , whether a youth who has been brought out of the family - you must always enter into action individually .
very interesting .
and they had no touch of contact ?
quantity : I am not the guy .
it is a range that gives a lot .
great love , a lot of kindness .
there are also negative moments , but this is that life .

the bombing is the last violence that brought Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at .
on Monday a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul .
in a position of NATO , the explosion was to take place on Thursday night when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afghan army was attacked by people with the Afghan army . &quot;
the statement says that all the last in a stable condition are being treated and in U.S. military hospital on the air@@ field Bag@@ ram .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group , known as so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h , is a great concern for NATO troops in the near Bag@@ ram .
according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian deaths in Afghanistan during the first half of 2017 , about 20 % in the capital .
at the end of July , a suicide car of at least 30 people killed in a mainly schi@@ p district of Kabul .
the Taliban said they had done this attack .
on 31 May , a massive bombar@@ d@@ ment in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the dead@@ ly mil@@ it@@ ant attack by the country , since the military forces attacked the Taliban in 2001 .
violence under@@ scores the prec@@ ari@@ ous security situation in Afghanistan , as U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump , the number of U.S. troops to support the military and police in the country .
correspondence should say that the suicide attacks in Kabul in the last weeks also caused a crisis of public trust in the government to have caused their policies and especially in the reputation of President Ash@@ raf Gh@@ ani .
EPA returns to the delay of the smo@@ g rule according to Kl@@ agen
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency filed a decision to oppos@@ e a regulation of the government of Obama , repe@@ aled which the states are oblig@@ ated to ins@@ ulated the smo@@ g @-@ caused emissions . this was a day after 15 States def@@ ended the agency due to the stri@@ de .
the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to describe the so @-@ called &quot; Oz@@ on@@ Rules 2015 &quot; and said they show the obligation of the agency to work with states .
&quot; we believe in the dialogue with and that we react to our state partners , &quot; said EPA boss Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in a statement .
P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of the EPA , the ozone regulations - in which in a part of the state of pollutants are to be measured in order to retain , where items must be made to have stric@@ ter air quality standards - to be delayed by a year until October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , together with the district of Colombia , filed a complaint on Tuesday , and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to impos@@ e a wide range of environmental impact that the former President Barack Obama sets out as part of a wider agenda that is supposed to boost economic growth according to Tr@@ ump .
however , efforts have triggered the response of the Democrats and nature groups that worry about the effects of greater emissions to public health .
the EPA &apos;s website says that the in@@ hal@@ ation of air , the ozone contains &quot; the lung function and reduce respiratory symptoms &quot; as an example of as@@ thma .
community that wants to be shared room
at the end the decision was clear : with two counter@@ voices , the Municipal Coun@@ ts of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ ds decides to set up a communal space in the future retirement home .
before the discussion there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the still missing basic part of the purchase was signed , Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ ades .
although until now , the church community will last until now , there is no plans for planning to escape from a private investor to st@@ em@@ atics project .
there is a discussion about a common space .
one of the two investors , which are still in the ship , offered to meet the congregation .
on the ground floor , it would have a living space - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a total of 70 square meters of floor space for a special price .
the administration and majority of the Municipal Coun@@ ts before , such a common room will not open at the meeting only for the residents of the sen@@ i@@ or@@ man &apos;s living , but open to the congregation .
as an example , the word made by the Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; made the round .
the decision made by the provision of funds for the ongoing budget has already been decided last autumn by funding .
the construction is in the san@@ itation area .
the establishment of a shared space was reported , T@@ j@@ ades reports , with 60 percent of 30 percent .
the decision of the decision to sign@@ alize the investor , that in this regard , there is no Kn@@ ü@@ ppel down between the legs , the conclusion that both the saddle and the environment construction - as well as P@@ ult@@ d@@ ach - what the tr@@ ash is reduced and the construction of the cost is possible .
not necessary , so do not only Wil@@ fried S@@ oh@@ mer , be this additive .
when it helps : unanimously he happen to the committee .
not as easy as it is at the common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He refers to the many own buildings , with which one will not come forward with the common room for the window , says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do so difficult to make me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ v@@ onne Sta@@ iger speaks necessarily for the common room , but absolutely against a municipal participation .
she looks behind that a payout of a payout to mis@@ fortune or religious investors .
this is not just so , because with the acquisition of the area you can not grant a surplus , but can get a real , in the dou@@ bling market value , the counter will speak .
Sta@@ ig@@ ers request , the decision of the decision to apply accordingly , will find three fears .
so it remains with two counter@@ voices in the original program , which Stefan H@@ aller summar@@ ises : &quot; if we receive the decision , we make a huge step into our infrastructure . &quot;

for the five rainfall in the past six testing , An@@ cel@@ otti has made the physical state and the missing balance in the game of his team .
&quot; we know that we are not in the best physical constitution , &quot; An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the last was not good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes on a performance increase in the first official shipping of the season .
&quot; soccer is also tac@@ tic , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the crew is ready .

the game is sold out with 8@@ 1.@@ 360 spectators , the German football League ( DF@@ L ) shared on Friday .
to hike in the resin of star
in the Harz , the nationwide first &quot; star base &quot; will be created .
this is planning the association Stern@@ warte Saint Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there have been a planet route in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star@@ ving &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; come to meet the need of many harp visitors , it was called . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he connect nature , science , movement , and sporty performance .
the members want to set up along the planned route boards and inform about stars and stell@@ ations .
during the first phase to 2018 , the association is planning to reach installations at five to six locations &quot; in the Ober@@ har@@ z .
in@@ quire , St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ e@@ ge@@ i@@ ß and Sie@@ ber .
information on the tables should be supplemented by Internet .
therefore , with the location selection , a good mobile network reception is a role .
also Acc@@ essi@@ bility is a crit@@ erion .
later the star@@ base train to be expanded by train .
&quot; on the star@@ ring , the viewer experienced a lot of knowledge , for example on the physics of the individual stars , &quot; declared the club .
in addition , they learned why stars different colors , or why a star stronger than another , although it is much further removed .
also , in which constellation can be found by the selected star and when he is best to see .
the Club has already been operating in the Berg@@ städ@@ tchen St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , the highest mountain Observatory in northern Germany since 2014 .
the location in the middle of the National Park is part of the federal government for nature protection for the six dark regions in Germany .
often from there from the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a galax@@ y with naked eye can see clearly .
since 2003 there has been a similar similar to the plan@@ et@@ arium of the plan@@ et@@ arium in the University of Göttingen , similar to the planned mortality rate - the plan@@ etary planet .
beginning before Geb@@ h@@ ards Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , the plan@@ etary of our solar system leads the planet route with its st@@ akes up to Hain@@ berg and the ob@@ servatory - as well as a &quot; non @-@ ear@@ thly &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( community ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the st@@ ems with the individual planets - including the d@@ warf plan@@ ed pl@@ u@@ to at the end point - are exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the earth sh@@ run@@ k like a ball of 6.5 millimeters in diameter while the sun measures exactly 75 meters ( 70 centi@@ metres away ) .
the entire distance of the planet is about four kilometres .
while the sunlight is needed up to the pl@@ u@@ to about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need good one hour to st@@ ele with Pl@@ u@@ to .
pedestri@@ ans are therefore faster than the light in the world .
the march to the next fixation would still take a half year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enk@@ o meet for the first time , discuss a possible show down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enk@@ o and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who should stand in a coll@@ age path in order to direct the most exciting pit struggle in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .

&quot; I am a former coil weight , &quot; remin@@ ded Gar@@ cia .
&quot; I got up for Br@@ oner &#91; on 140 lbs &#93; , but I &apos;m not so great .
I am small for 140 .
I want to reduce light weight .
and he has to move to light weight &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
that require the fans .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enk@@ o voted too .
&quot; boxing needs this battle . &quot;
climate asked if it should be to pay on pay @-@ by @-@ view , part of a strategy , the Lom@@ ach@@ enk@@ o with a 135 @-@ pound debut in this year to make a date to agree to the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell , following their Ligh@@ tweight championship battle at the Forum on September 23 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this battle could take place in the Pay @-@ per @-@ View mode because all fans asked him asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia , and pressed later on to fight with the network that offers the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other name can create this kind of attention .
when always they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enk@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lom@@ ach@@ enk@@ o as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an enormous com@@ bat@@ ants , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he may possibly participate in his Saturday battle . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Gar@@ cia said , the focus is to show stroke strength , then boxes .

&quot; this is the battle that must be carried out .
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am more than happy to work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enk@@ o said : &quot; I have been waiting for the top com@@ bat@@ ants , and that &apos;s Mi@@ key .
it will be a great fight . &quot;
four ver@@ t to tire plat@@ ers
when an accident on the A7 , four people were seriously wounded in the afternoon .
after the first information , the driver of a Opel Z@@ af@@ ira was lost shortly before the end of the market , presumably after a tyre tra@@ cker the control over his vehicle .
the passenger car pushed to the right into the goats , where he over@@ threw and then remained on the roof in the Gr@@ unge Stri@@ p .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were seriously wounded in the accident .
during the initial supply of the past through the rescue service the A7 in the direction of North for about one hour , then the traffic on the left @-@ left strip could be buried at the bottom of the accident .
Fort@@ unas Hoffmann : &quot; turning chain works better &quot;
Andr@@ e Hoffmann was hop@@ ing after 2 : 2 at the season open@@ er to Braunschweig , allowing the optim@@ isation of def@@ ensive information in Au@@ e points .
with the first seasonal game in Andr@@ e Hoffmann , Andr@@ e Hoffmann was happy with the result , because the two oppos@@ ites had been at the age of 2 : 2 .
&quot; that were two oppos@@ e too much , and we have to fit in Au@@ e even better , &quot; says the def@@ enders of Fortuna Düsseldorf .
in the Erz@@ gebirge the turning chain should also be further optimized .
and a fool according to a exemp@@ tion will not want to take advantage of the Fort@@ un@@ es .
&quot; for the future , there will be so that no longer next to Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) will turn onto the line . &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better right after the experiences in preparation with the turning chain better than with the quadru@@ ped chain .
&quot; even I don &apos;t know how we will act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is his case sure , &quot; because we just have in the turning chain in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and N@@ iko G@@ ie@@ ß@@ mann players who can build well , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ ite is , but we are even better harmon@@ ize and we don &apos;t aff@@ ord so many fl@@ aw@@ less errors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course Hoffmann also goes to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if one cannot speak after an un@@ decided start , don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the performance could definitely be okay , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we are able to concentrate on Sunday with four points and can be focused on the cup , we will surely be able to talk about an ordinary season open@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of which his trainer wanted to know nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the start into the season will I only talk after six to eight days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who doesn &apos;t want to speak of a benefit opposite Au@@ e , only because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be canc@@ eled . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ y and Hoffmann &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Funk@@ y and Hoffmann &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the player from Au@@ e might even be a little bit because they had no he@@ avi@@ est and complete game like Fortuna for a asc@@ ension in the bones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t know that 100 % where they are currently standing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the inner def@@ enders of Fortuna . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although guests from the Rhineland go as little favorite on Sunday in the meeting ( almost ) finished stadium from Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we should take them away , only because we have the right to come under the first six , Bl@@ ö@@ d@@ ity &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance sheet is quite positive against Au@@ e of nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team in the 2 . Bundesliga , which one must hit from the fore@@ head , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fort@@ is the Chief coach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a testimony to meet ar@@ ro@@ gant and adul@@ ter@@ ous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so Funk@@ el will experience his players on Sunday on Sunday .
new results of the Swedish As@@ ylum old evaluation tests were published
the latest results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , which were subjected to a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested people are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes on accuracy of these results .
the Swedish Authority for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( hard @-@ bearing ) has begun with the implementation of tests last year .
during the asylum procedure , the assessment of age should be more precise , since the Swedish migration Authority ( Mig@@ r@@ ations@@ verk@@ usen ) was critic@@ ised because of the assessment of the correct age of some refugees .
until today , Mig@@ r@@ ations@@ ellers sent 6,@@ 880 to test@@ end cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results from a total of 2,@@ 481 tests from the period from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 .
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in another 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency issued that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
in 432 the conclusion was that the person is &quot; possibly under 18 years old . &quot;
the tests will only be carried out in cases where the age of the person is questi@@ oned .
according to Johan G@@ ö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are resistant to last months .
&quot; we see no big difference in the statistics of the past months , the numbers are pretty constant , &quot; he said the magazine The Local .
the high proportion of cases , in which the person was judged as over 18 years , does not necessarily means that the asylum seek@@ ers has to be over his age .
in May , the Agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there were 4@@ 42 cases that the subjects had to be 18 years or older . &quot;
when the newspaper sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bl@@ a@@ det out the 5@@ 81 published results , it noted that in 243 of these cases the person had said that they would be 18 years old .
the method of medical age assessment , with the X @-@ ray recordings of wisdom teeth and MRI recordings are analyzed , which are then critic@@ ized by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , was critic@@ ised in some areas .
a sc@@ ep@@ tics is the En@@ do@@ kr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ inska Institut , whose work comprises the evaluation of the biological friction of people to see if they were earlier or later than usual by the pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think that the type of measurement should be used .
to evaluate the biological age in this way , is very un@@ certain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we cannot tell it , we should not do as if we could &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the newspaper Metro . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , G@@ ö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency def@@ ended the accuracy of tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of an adult is illegal to assess the risk .
the largest risk is in this case , if the person is under 18 , this case is about 10 percent . &quot;
full in the plan
the work on the three bridges of the Highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg come well .
on Wednesday a seven tons of heavy concrete was installed on the bridge at the eastern part of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good at the time , it works great , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , Building Manager at Road Network and Transport in the government office in Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in April , work simultaneously started on all three frozen bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the end is intended for October and is sure that the schedule is adher@@ ed to schedule .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg leads through the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a v@@ ault bridge made of concrete , which is dressed with a red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 meters .
built in 1900 .
as the two other bridges , it has come to the years now .
in order to ensure the stability and traffic safety , the three construction works are thoroughly rehabil@@ it@@ ated .
the two other bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built in red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were erected in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10,@@ 60 meters long .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach is now on Wednesday morning at the north side a 1.@@ 30 meter wide and seven tons heavy so called Br@@ ück@@ enk@@ o .
this is an edge fixing , which is used as operating time .
on the southern part of the bridge you should be used on Friday a 2.@@ 20 meter wide bridge .
then the pedestrian path should be left .
the special thing is that it is planned for finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already equipped with the patented Br@@ ück@@ enk@@ ins .
the laying of leads through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach has special finger@@ tips .
as there is a glass fibre cable , which are connected to many companies .
the residents were informed about the project in front of work through handic@@ ra@@ fts .
in addition , fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be f@@ ished .
for the bridges between the building site and the gathering in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg the traffic track is regulated by an traffic light .
for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ b@@ acher area , the street is closed in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; .
the costs for the three bridge markers amounts to 700 000 euros .
the whole is financed through the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ below protest at German potato salad
it doesn &apos;t come to pass that parties on a beach draw , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , what else is difficult to bring to a hat .
the parties in the Kre@@ ist@@ ag volcan@@ ic parties ( CDU , SPD , Grün@@ e , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Lin@@ ke ) belong to a wide alliance that shows peace@@ fully flag because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle Ron@@ dell invites to the &quot; large election campaign &quot; in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle Ron@@ dell .
and well @-@ known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , together with Alexander Gau@@ land , forms the top duo for the Bundestag election on September 24 , and the Deputy Prime Minister Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are already working hours before the start of the event , don &apos;t want to listen to the Af@@ D dealers , but demonstrate .
the &quot; Eifel remains colourful . &quot;
originally the city pic@@ nic was planned under the motto &quot; Show all at a table &quot; on the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but now take place on the parking place below the Ron@@ d@@ ells - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle .
a colorful image that has been here .
and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chair@@ woman of the For@@ ums A world and one of the main organizers , really pleased : &quot; great , how many people are joined here . &quot;
there are music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; &quot; German potato sal@@ at which could also eat the Af@@ D easily , &quot; says the woman who has brought him away .
the police opened many officials after Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence in particular on the railway station , which is just a few meters from the venues .
how is the Af@@ D actually came to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes from Af@@ s@@ Af@@ s@@ fel reported that he has been supporting such event and received an allowance .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ n@@ ers@@ dorf had first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation , because because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us kir@@ mes do not exist enough parking spaces .
so now the Ron@@ dell , Hom@@ pes are pleased that &quot; we can have a nice event here . &quot;
with a view of the event on the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ ó , he says : &quot; this is the good right of people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
it also does it : at 20 o &apos;clock the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ pre@@ platz is a band for entertainment , in the Stad@@ thalle several speakers , including the Rhineland @-@ pf@@ a@@ ische Af@@ D leader Uwe boy .
in the room there are about 200 list@@ eners that are waiting to wait for the German Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the Deputy Prime Minister Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
unchanged , the police station , but so far the officials had a quiet night .
a little more than one hour takes the Af@@ D event , the guests on the site have a longer breath , but also there is too short after 21 hrs .
police may g@@ aps - no special inci@@ dents .

Kri@@ sten Stewart speaks about her bis@@ exual
&quot; some people love gr@@ illed cheese and will eat it until the end of their life .
but I want to try everything , &quot; so Kri@@ sten Stewart is quite openly about her bis@@ exual .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I think once in gr@@ illed cheese , I think , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh that was cool , what comes next ? &apos; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the probably most famous relationship of the Hollywood star was that of her &quot; T@@ wil@@ ight &quot; colleagues Robert Patt@@ inson , who finally went bitter .
despite all of the insured the brun@@ ette Dar@@ stell@@ o opposite the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s B@@ az@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was in every serious I have changed .
or do you think about , I have played it ? &quot;
according to their separation there was Kri@@ sten that they are bis@@ exual : &quot; I always lived and seriously believed on the du@@ alism .
it never has never conf@@ used or imp@@ aired me .
I could not only never be taken away . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ang show bi@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in school time they prefer to clo@@ the like a bu@@ b : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that really was really hurt .
when I was eleven , I told me the children , I would look like a bu@@ b .
I really felt really attacked and damaged and damaged .
now I look back and remember : &apos; girl , be proud of you ! &apos; .
especially the public they don &apos;t love its love to live : &quot; people expect you to be a certain type and this anno@@ ys me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps I draw me some as a few , but I don &apos;t like it to justi@@ fy me before all the public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
governor of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
the Democratic Govern@@ or of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday night at a rally with President Tr@@ ump , that he will change the party .
whether you like it or not , the Democrats have removed from me , &quot; said Govern@@ or Justice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I will tell you with lots of prayers ... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rally broke out in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republi@@ can , &quot; added Justice .
&quot; as a trainer I would say that it &apos;s at the time to play a different game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised before a big announcement at West Virginia Rally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice not endor@@ sed the democratic candidate in Hill@@ ary Clinton .
Justice , according to Forbes , the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
Forbes represents that he owns the carbon dioxide in five states , and by his father a carbon business .
he is worth about 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee issued a declaration in which it said : &quot; the party change of Govern@@ or Justice is another blow for a Democratic Party that would rather than work to work in order to make our land great . &quot;
&quot; only 15 Government and the control of the least legal entities in history is the announcement of a party , which is from above to bottom without leadership , and not able to find a positive , reas@@ oning message , &quot; said the R@@ NC chairman R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel said in a statement to C@@ BS News .
CO@@ E engaged &quot; hon@@ our@@ able &quot; Russian sorry for d@@ oping @-@ sc@@ and@@ al
the world leader of the athlet@@ ics , Sebastian Co@@ e , lob@@ ster on Thursday , which he described as obvious exc@@ use from Russia to a d@@ oping sc@@ and@@ al , but he repeated it was not the moment for the country to be resum@@ ed in the sport .
Russian Athlet@@ ics Chef D@@ mit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ ak@@ ht@@ in said during the IA@@ AF World Championships on the eve of the Athlet@@ ics World Championships that the Go@@ ing of his country was correct and that he was determined to fight the d@@ oping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes who were cut off with competitions gold and silver medals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF congress voted for maintaining the ban on which in November 2015 , after a report by the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) was found on state @-@ sponsored d@@ oping in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open answer , a very hon@@ our@@ able presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF @-@ President Co@@ e the repor@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire Council and the entire Congress were pleased that Russian Federation has experienced in itself , that she has experienced some rather hot times and everything will do to ensure that the Federation shall be redesigned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am also happy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact that Russia must accept the criteria for his integration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very attractive day , and I think that adv@@ ances were achieved , but the Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to use Russia , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; we must do everything in the next few months to norm@@ alize this situation .
the gui@@ ding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the dep@@ ra@@ ved system , &quot; he added
ninet@@ een Russian athl@@ ete will begin with the Athlet@@ ics World Championships , which will start Friday in London after the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral actors .
the head of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must still fulfil some of the criteria for a re@@ vocation .
drug may still be an in@@ adequate and banned train@@ ers , he said repor@@ ters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council .
soldiers cut into Mali crashed into Mali
at a fun@@ eral service in Northern Fran@@ itz@@ lar , around 1000 people of the two were killed in a helicopter crash in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the Dom@@ stadt under high security arrangements .
to the un@@ explained crash , Defense Minister Ursula of the Le@@ yen ( CDU ) said nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she called the two &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ ner of their professional &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we tend to have told us before this highest cas@@ u@@ alties that they have completed in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old staff of Nord@@ h@@ essen had died on Wednesday a week in the West African Mali .
their coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and transferred on Thursday by a Total Commander of the Bundes@@ wehr in the Fr@@ itz@@ el Dom Sankt Peter .
at noon , only the relatives of the church was first abandoned .
after that , the fun@@ eral service began in the circle of family , close friends , from representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr , as well as the politics .
these were also H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CDU ) and the General Insp@@ ector of the Armed Forces Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
down the grape of the grape , the relatives stood in the arm in the arm of his arms .
in front of the church , Fr@@ itz@@ mann@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas .
def@@ endant of the Le@@ yen created the converted soldiers , decorated as &quot; highly decorated &quot; and sat@@ in .
the Stab@@ pt@@ mann had built the flight operation of the fighting th@@ readed joint tiger in Fr@@ itz@@ lar with one of the first six trained tiger pilots of his reg@@ im@@ ents .
also Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , Com@@ man@@ de@@ ur of the Reg@@ iment to which the soldiers belong , declared : &quot; if this crew could not turn off the crash , it would not have any failure . &quot;
doubt the UN mission in Mali showed no name from the Le@@ yen : the action is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he is also of high importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country where we only separated by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the fun@@ eral service the coff@@ ins were brought out of the cathedral .
when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr made no data .
Prince Hen@@ rik wants to take a grave beside his wife
the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be buried alongside his wife .
this is the royal house on Thursday .
traditionally , the Danish Royal Palace is buried in the cathedral &apos;s Cathedral of Ros@@ kil@@ de .
the sculptor Bj@@ ø@@ r@@ n N@@ ø@@ r@@ ga@@ ard made a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ agus to the two .
the queen of her husband &apos;s decision was to be made with the decision of her husband &apos;s decision .
where Prince Hen@@ rik was buried , be still un@@ clear .
but he didn &apos;t have the intention to be buried in his French home .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a command that he was not happy with his title .
after the thr@@ illing of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 he would like to be king .
in 2016 he retired from retirement and lays down the title &quot; prin@@ cess@@ es . &quot;
since Hen@@ rik in Denmark doesn &apos;t get the title and the function that he wanted to see himself in his wife , not even after death , declared L@@ ene Bal@@ le@@ by , the Chief of the Danish king &apos;s royal house .
where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old finally will be , be un@@ clear .
but he didn &apos;t have the intention to be buried in his French hom@@ eland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country for which he worked in the last 50 years .
the native @-@ Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of an French noble gender , had learned to know Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London .
on the Th@@ ames he worked in the French Embassy .
during his later female , Prince Hen@@ rik had always had a serious booth at the Dan@@ es in his almost 50 years of reg@@ im@@ ine .
in a auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik said about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did .
my Danish wine was fluctu@@ ating , I have preferred wine instead of beer , so@@ ck@@ ings instead of Stri@@ ck@@ so@@ cks , Citroën instead of Volvo , Tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ gy , I smo@@ ked in instead of Virginia tobacco , and those who agree to the reputation to be the brand of trade @-@ critical intellec@@ tu@@ als , I could not hope to hope .
I was different .
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not to be ashamed .
these were two mist@@ akes ! &quot;

obj@@ ectively Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) is after the loss of the red @-@ green government multilingual for a rapid re @-@ election of land tags , but he does not want to withdraw .
because he spoke to the dis@@ solution of the Parliament on Friday .
previously , the surprising exit of a Green @-@ group leader in Lower Saxony had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) in a severe crisis .
five months before the official date of the country @-@ election the red @-@ green coalition lost their cris@@ y majority in parliament to the opposition from CDU and F@@ DP .
the old Green Party El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets formed their step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in their elec@@ toral circle in Rot@@ enburg ( W@@ üm@@ me ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CDU , &quot; she explained on Friday in Hannover on Friday .
CDU Fra@@ ction Bj@@ örn Th@@ ur@@ ler wants to recommend its Group to record it .
with this , CDU and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the Lower Land@@ tag , SPD and Green 68 seats .
to date , the reverse was vice vers@@ a .
the new Parliament will be elected on 14 January next year .
Th@@ ur@@ ler said that the red @-@ green state government had to decide whether they could rise in this situation without majority .
Stephan Weil , however , does it hold of un@@ ce@@ able that the landing @-@ day quickly resol@@ ves his self @-@ resolution .
the CDU faction is expected to take on Tuesday over her further advance .
the country &apos;s constitution is also the possibility that the governor of the Prime Minister has cho@@ oses confidence and cho@@ oses a successor .
&quot; our Constitution provides several options .
these possibilities must be legally checked , &quot; said Th@@ es@@ ler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will be aware of all the questions when they are legally binding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Th@@ ings@@ ler named T@@ West &apos;s step &quot; but a little cur@@ i@@ os . &quot;
the policy of politics said : &quot; I &apos;m not a slan@@ ting .
I feel very good . &quot;

they decided to have no pron@@ unci@@ ation in the Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in front of the background , there was no significant differences , we cannot draw this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Minister of Agriculture in the Interview - How do we protect us from gyp@@ sies , Mr. Schmidt ?
Germany disc@@ usses discuss@@ ing eggs .
how could the sc@@ and@@ al happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves .
the Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is in an interview with the editor of Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and response .
Mr. Schmidt , how can the consumer protect eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumer goods and consumers , check out the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp up .
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the states represent the latest information about the affected eggs bat@@ ches .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if everything we know currently , a health threat is practically excluded .
now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis reaction - all the eggs get out of the offer - because the central role of the re@@ conn@@ aissance Minister is not really perceived by the Federal Minister ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
nevertheless , my house has reached immediately , and has since dis@@ closure of Germany &apos;s data subject to close exchange with the authorities of the countries .
all information and risk assessment are available for consumers .
the trade has just as the manufacturer to ensure that the sold products are market@@ able and health un@@ th@@ ink@@ able .
if in eggs the residual moisture content of 0,00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded , these are not traffic .
un@@ loaded eggs , however , can be sold and consumed .
this time is not to bl@@ ame .
sit production companies and consumers in the same boat ?
according to the ze@@ al characteristic , the production plants meets no immediate debt .
rather , it must be due to the alleged illegal practices of service firms with economic damages .
as always there is too little control in the harvest .
is it l@@ acks only on the staff or the killing of jurisdiction ?
there were just the official controls that have revealed the process .
however , to the truth , food and criminal energy never belongs to 100 percent .
just as a result , a consistent adv@@ ent of such events and transfer to the attor@@ ney are in the cases in which offen@@ ders are able to be crucial .
I have already made several times , that I expect a consistent re@@ conn@@ aissance commission from the responsible authorities .
is the regular alarm cabinet really necessary ?
consumers and consumers have the right to obtain exclusively reliable and transport @-@ capable food .
if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ ci@@ de in the food industry , consumer goods and consumers are subject to legal .
by means of pan@@ ze@@ al means , manufacturers , tra@@ ders and consumers come into a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
generally , it must be clear : the illegal use of the insec@@ ti@@ ci@@ de Fi@@ pro@@ il at the attitude of life @-@ proof animals is not acceptable and must be terminated immediately .
it has to be consistently implemented on all levels and with high pressure .
I expect from all competent authorities to clari@@ fy the atomic fact and con@@ sens@@ us .
how is the financial rules of football on Ne@@ ym@@ ars move to Paris
the rules that aim to prevent un@@ disp@@ uted issues of the European football clubs , Ne@@ ym@@ ars world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain are not distur@@ b .
any consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Germain of the UEFA , because the conduc@@ tive organization that monitors the European game has power , teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair Play @-@ Rules , which were launched in 2011 by the UEFA Cup , mean that PS@@ G must be able to re@@ prove that the transfer from Ne@@ ym@@ ar was financed without major losses .
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 262 million US $ ) to buy the Bras@@ ili@@ ians from his contract , and Ne@@ ym@@ ar will receive a salary that will amount to several ten million dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of Ne@@ ym@@ ars moved to France .
PS@@ G can make the money loosely , so that Ne@@ ym@@ ar under@@ takes care and bring him to a galax@@ y of other stars , given the financing of the team by the Energy @-@ rich Herr@@ scher@@ family of Qatar .
Ver@@ one may apply to the purchase of players a lot of money , but they have to communicate with legitim@@ ate income sources , which enable them to break the break @-@ even point in their football @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini , following his election to the UEFA president in 2007 .
the former French player believed that they had taken their support in their stre@@ ches after success , effectively g@@ ged and ris@@ ed to ru@@ in , if banks or owners leave their support .
in 2011 FF@@ P climbed from the concentration to the debt of clubs on the supervision of their losses .
the change meant that the business model was used by the Roman Ab@@ ram@@ ovi@@ ch originally used in 2003 in Chelsea - a club with potential and then invested strongly to build the team and build a global brand - to a har@@ der matter .
during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P deposits , which runs until 2018 , clubs may take losses of EUR 30 million .
and even though , Plat@@ ini has fallen from the presi@@ dency in inno@@ cence in 2015 , his UEFA @-@ successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander Ce@@ fer@@ in continues to make a constant expenditure .
&quot; surely , FF@@ P is not dead and we will strengthen the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ b , who is responsible for the UEFA for FF@@ P , compared with The Associated Press last week .
although PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out cl@@ ause from Ne@@ ym@@ ar in a package , it can distribute the amount for the invoice about the duration of his contract .
Ne@@ ym@@ ar signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the redemption for the next five years will be expressed in the annual financial statements of 4@@ 4.4 million euros .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has joined the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the he@@ avi@@ est sanctions .
the PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( at that time 82 million dollars ) , which was later lowered to 20 million euros , and it was arranged that the teams for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players , otherwise normal 25 players remain limited .
the UEFA is looking for clubs , trying to over@@ look their financial statements by increasing their revenues by companies that are linked to the owners of a club .
while a cat@@ astroph@@ ic company may sponsor PS@@ G , if the value of sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market rates , the UEFA should not apply as a legitim@@ ate regime .
this happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the value of the Spon@@ sor@@ ings of the Qatar Tourism Authority was puff@@ ed up .
it was reported that a part of PS@@ G payments to Ne@@ ym@@ ar can be found in Qatar about payments of the Organ@@ izing Committee of the World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar have disp@@ uted that Ne@@ ym@@ ar World ambassador will be simply trying to find out an active man@@ oeu@@ vre for UEFA regulatory authorities .
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G represent that the UEFA will be no more effective , every attempt to keep the rules .
the UEFA had no pre@@ paid convers@@ ations with PS@@ G on Ne@@ ym@@ ars transfer , said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .
they said among the condition of an@@ onym@@ ity with The Associated Press , since they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the last published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of € 54@@ 2.4 million .
the accounts for the last financial year must be published .
PS@@ G expects that Ne@@ ym@@ ars arrive a blessing for Spon@@ sor@@ ing Deals , mer@@ chan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ c@@ ot@@ ch sales .
the association proceeds from that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after signing the signature .
the Spanish League was clearly im@@ it@@ ated to see one of the best football players , and they tried to prevent Ne@@ ym@@ ars course by giving that PS@@ G would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P .
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financial di@@ oping &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the President of the La League , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Kat@@ h last owner at PS@@ G .
Arsenal @-@ Manager Ar@@ s@@ ene W@@ enger , whose association is owned by American Sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ ons , divi@@ des the Reserv@@ ation of La League against a state that financed an association .
&quot; it is the consequence of the owner and that has changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; said W@@ enger on Thursday .
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible .
it is very difficult to respect the Financial Fair@@ play because you can have different ways or different interests if a country has a great actor to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new sh@@ og@@ gil@@ ance
in recent years Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y Bord @-@ Chocolate has produced chocolate to the Swiss .
now the Coll@@ aboration of a possible end : the airline writes the job again .

how many applic@@ ants are available to the new call , the Swiss does not want to betra@@ y .
in question , however , only Swiss producers come .
according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make a renewal of the contract beyond spring 2018 .
for the S@@ DA , the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not accessible for a statement .

blow against drugs @-@ Mafia in the country
the police is a blow against the Italian Mafia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , in the Black Forest @-@ Ba@@ ar district , in Rot@@ tw@@ eil , Constance , Esslingen and Stuttgart , numerous objects were searched for the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office in Constance on Friday .
during the age of 15 years , 15 years and 77 years were arrested and already issued arrest warran@@ ts .
in addition , the officers asked larger amounts of mari@@ juana and co@@ ca@@ ine , weapons and several hundred thousand euros safe .
at the same Raz@@ or in Italy two people were arrested .
the German arrest warran@@ ts issued against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans .
the two are therefore likely to be delivered to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in action .
over 300 polic@@ emen were used in total .
the Mafia members organized drug de@@ crimin@@ ality , severe violence , su@@ bret@@ inal murder as well as rob@@ ber@@ y and er@@ ti@@ fication .
since summer 2016 , the Public Prosecutor &apos;s office has been determined by the Public Drug Administration in the south @-@ German room .
between the attor@@ ney in Constance and Palermo a re@@ an exchange and the investig@@ ator of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
therefore the big insert on Wednesday morning was accompanied by four officials from Palermo on Wednesday morning .

way compl@@ ains great g@@ aps in the fore@@ igner stops
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data of citizens that should not appear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a report , the fore@@ igner stops in Germany shows significant short@@ com@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the lead to partly gra@@ zing mis@@ decisions for asylum procedures .
the government manager for the refugee management of the German Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen , has made a media report that happened to large g@@ aps in the country &apos;s rural register .
def@@ ici@@ encies , in an analysis , could result in an analysis of the &quot; Southern German newspaper &quot; during asylum procedures and deportation . &quot;
according to the data , ten million people were recorded with foreign nationality , including 5.7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data are therefore administered by some 600 foreign authorities in Germany .
because the data has not been kept in@@ well maintained , the data quality in parts have not been good so far .
in terms of cases , data from 1921 were found , &quot; by people who have long been far from life , or citizens , who have become a citizen of citizens and not to immer@@ se any more in the register . &quot;
&quot; faul@@ ty data inputs can significantly decrease recur@@ ring processes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it to the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the statistics of travelling foreign people , the EU citizens have been recorded , which would not have to go out .
however , such wrong assign@@ ments were led to a debate on dealing with immig@@ rants , &quot; means it is therefore in the analysis .
the federal government evi@@ d@@ ently begin to return refugee families with under 16 @-@ year @-@ old children , returning to Italy when they arrived from there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this comes forth from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( B@@ AM@@ F ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New Markets &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( B@@ AM@@ F ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the paper it means that B@@ AM@@ F will lead such procedures &quot; concerning families with children - except infants and infants - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
since the end of 2014 , practically no longer was possible , the newspaper under reference to the difficult situation on site .
following Dublin &apos;s agreement , the EU government is responsible for refugees from the EU .
if a mig@@ rant travels to another EU country , this state can send him back into the destination .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the grounds of grounds the office now write : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile the recording capacity for families with minor children in Italy has increased substantially . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Italy made available for recording and accommodation of families warran@@ ties .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( E@@ GM@@ R ) are sufficient for sufficient .
other EU states would also send refugees in the context of the Dublin @-@ Agreement .
the internal political spokes@@ person on the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children above for lack of defects in the Italian As@@ ylum System and a end@@ anger@@ ment of childhood . &quot;

the Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation the spec@@ ulation over an increase .
the Bank of England has war@@ ned that economic growth will remain , when the interest rates remain on family in the middle of a reinforced pressure .
the political decision @-@ makers of the European Committee ( M@@ PC ) agreed with 6 to 2 to keep the interest rates to 0.25 % , with this month less people had a rise , since the weak economic growth has weak@@ ened the support for an increase .
in its quarterly annual inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7 % and for 2018 to 1.6 % and war@@ ned that the inflation would continue to rise to almost 3 % in the autumn .
but they signals that in the next few years of interest would be necessary to beat the inflation rate of the Bre@@ x@@ it , and they said that loan costs may be expected to rise more than expected to the financial markets .
the members also agreed to withdraw a part of the Mamm@@ ut business package that was published before a year after Bre@@ x@@ it .
it will require time for the financial plan to provide cheap funding for banks , although it is said that it is expected to provide 15 billion pounds more in the context of this system - with 115 billion pounds Sterling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; minutes after the decision on the interest rate the bank said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the central progn@@ osis of the M@@ PC remains weak ( GDP ) in short term , as the pressure will continue to reach the consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the interest rates , they repeated that &quot; a certain pen@@ ance of monetary policy &quot; to the cooling of inflation and a &quot; slightly larger &quot; magnitude necessary , than the markets are expected .
the markets forecast the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank stressed that increases &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gradu@@ ations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be limited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank revised revised growth forecast for this and next year are 1.9 % and 1.7 % compared to the revised growth forecast .
she retained its growth forecast on 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell down to the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision to no change is coming after the recent dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth are increasing expectations to a interest rate and GDP in the second quarter increased from 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % .
growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it is easy to recover after the Bank at the end of the year .
the youngest of inflation offered little enthusiasm for households who are affected by a rising inflation and mar@@ gin@@ ally salary increases , because the deep@@ ening is even worse before it will be improved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that monetary policy in the next few years can &apos;t prevent the revenue decrease &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but they added that the wages ended up to the end of their triple @-@ year forecast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , which is attributable to the weak Po@@ unds , which will compens@@ ate a part of lower consumption expend@@ itures .
the decision comes after the decrease of interest rates to 0.25 % in the last August after the sho@@ cking EU vote , which caused the sin@@ ks of the po@@ orer .
the Bank estimates that it is likely to last four years until the prices and the economy is complete .
prior to the last judgment of the Bank at interest rates , the reputation was increased after a interest rate since inflation increased its pressure on hard @-@ op@@ pressed households , with three political decision makers in July had an increase of 0.5 % .
the inflation rate in June last month dropped from 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % , although the Bank said that this was expected to come back again in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said that aims at the relationship with its goal of 2 % is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be ashamed of the weak pound . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andrew Mont@@ lake , director at Co@@ rec@@ o Mort@@ ar Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the recent back of the s@@ wap rate , the mort@@ gage market is likely to be more competitive since the lending service would like to seek after shops and end the year in a positive way .
the market looks particularly well for those who include the existing Deal and include the new mort@@ g@@ ages , and many are increasingly popular with free options and low rates . &quot;
N@@ HS ( The National Health Service ) should disp@@ oss@@ ess 10,000 people in controversi@@ al HIV drug .
in September after a fight against the High Court &apos;s High Court , patients will receive access to the financing of the medicine in N@@ HS . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HIV prevention treatment &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS England announced that one in front of the sexual intercourse ( Pr@@ EP ) , which may reduce the risk of infection in high risk patients by around 86 percent , is now supplied by the health service over a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he declared himself to finance the trial , after the Appeals Court confirmed a verdict of the Supreme Court in the past year , which the N@@ HS had to pay the powers that the authorities should finance him in spite of the asser@@ tion that the local authorities should finance him .
on Thursday , the chess train was announced by N@@ HS England @-@ boss Simon Stev@@ ens as &quot; important new intervention &quot; during the National AIDS Trust ( NAT ) as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Brigh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool , and She@@ ff@@ ield will be the first to make the registration of people , and other clinics will follow in October 2018 in the whole of England .
pre@@ defined sp@@ rop@@ hy@@ la@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) is a result of HIV drugs that are taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that Pr@@ EP reduces the HIV transmission to inf@@ ectious disease .
Pr@@ EP before sexual intercourse means that just enough medic@@ ations are present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection .
such medicines may be taken every day or so two hours before sexual intercourse .
those who come to question among the treatment , sw@@ ule or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexual and people with HIV positive partners , who were not successfully treated successfully .
in hospitals , suitable participants are identified , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who controls a partner whose HIV status does not have known as well @-@ known as anti @-@ retro@@ vir@@ al treatment .
people who live in England and are registered with a house physician , can also register for a possible participation in their local @-@ participating sexual clinic .
the program will award £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply medicines in this week according to an international competitive proc@@ urement .
the study will evaluate the entire potential of Pr@@ EP , which are collected and implemented in a large scale , as it is implemented in a large scale .
Stev@@ ens said : &quot; this great intervention should add the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful effort to prevention of HIV .
it is a further milestone in the more than three decades of progress in the awareness of one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot;
Deb@@ orah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National AIDS Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a decisive moment in the fight against HIV .
Pr@@ EP , if it is targeted to needy and end@@ anger@@ ed people , the possibility to change the English HIV epi@@ demic .
in September , people with high HIV risk access to this N@@ HS @-@ financed attempt in England to develop a new instrument , which is really individually controlled and is not subject to negoti@@ ate with a partner that leads to improving many , many lives .
we welcome you very warm@@ ly this announcement . &quot;
Ian Green , Chairman of the Terr@@ ence H@@ ig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; the priority must now be done quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV .
now , since the Pr@@ EP test medicine was created , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot;
Sharon Hod@@ g@@ son , Sh@@ adows @-@ Health Minister , said : &quot; the beginning of the Pr@@ EP process is welcome to months of del@@ ays and direct implementation by the government .
the evidence shows how trans@@ forming this drug as part of our approach to HIV Pre@@ vention and may termin@@ ate the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to the understanding of the Adv@@ ant@@ ages of Pr@@ EP .
now it is important that this study will be done quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people who are infected with HIV , and that they will be used to join HIV in the society of dis@@ sem@@ ination of HIV .
the big life live : mezzanine and cle@@ ver designers tricks have turned this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a generous home
Jo@@ anne L@@ eig@@ h , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , resi@@ zed by a large house in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court apartment in 2014 .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it &apos;s a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed their bags and sold .
&quot; before that I lived with my ex in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; says Jo@@ anne .
&quot; I searched for something that was comparable to my price .
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and she had the same high ceilings .
I have loved me in it and made a bid that day . &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot has been completely overhau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ room estate with a covered layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to get jo@@ anne storage space and a mezzanine to get the generous ceiling height optimally .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , much light .
that was my request , &quot; says it .
for this purpose she assigned the Architecture and Design Studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Notting Hill , which was not only a development but also a place to life for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not big enough to place two spaces , so that the architectural challenge was insi@@ sted to create a mezzanine in which one could stand .
Er@@ fan had to be creative thinking to solve the task .
&quot; the steel unit is quite complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stack@@ ed together , without having to g@@ aps .
it was not just to build a simple platform , but to make the steel so that he had the right height for the function above or below . &quot;
this arrangement made it possible to place two rooms in full height with a lot of additional drama .
for the mezzanine looks a classic copper light of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us down across the gl@@ am@@ our@@ ous living area .
woven gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille L@@ ille has the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays an role in adding theatre , space and light .
a short corridor on both ends can be mir@@ ro@@ red in order to work longer .
in the kitchen the mir@@ r@@ oring feels like a window in another room .
at the entrance we offer space for all cutlery bowls and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
through the perception of a smoo@@ ther space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen , if it is not used .
foldable kitchens are not new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bit of engineering art came in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important so that when you push the door , it is very easy to guide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the cle@@ ver@@ ing space of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne was able to win an additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the day you will sell the basic surface - or as your property is estimated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ ment@@ ary form , a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the soil size . &quot;
here they managed to enlarge the floor space and use high @-@ quality materials to use the room its luxury advantage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things you touch and are helping to create a emotional relationship in a home &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t love you into the electrical sockets in walls .
these are important but they are not playing with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself by good design and increased square met@@ ers@@ ness of something standard into something very aston@@ ishing .
in fact , as Jo@@ anne , you could decide to leave this not .
brothers fight for a 500 million US dollar real estate empire
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the d@@ ynast@@ y , in a meditation because of one of the largest real estate ad Vict@@ ori@@ as worth over $ 500 million .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and developers Colin De Lut@@ is lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors of his younger brother Paul . this has brought him to the Supreme Court to clari@@ fy how their property and their business assets shall be split .
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp meditation on the separation takes place in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , brothers have accumulated 38 real estate valued at over half a billion dollars , since the family bought a shop in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood .
there , the West@@ co family founded Je@@ ans and grew at a chain of 160 retail outlets .
it was sold to USD 85 million in 1999 .
this money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lut@@ is now comprises offices in the urban area , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sorrento , the apartments in gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping m@@ alls in the suburbs .
according to an agreement with their de@@ ceased father Colin - was described by Paul as the main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the De Lut@@ is family - about two thirds of the company &apos;s oil and Paul is about one @-@ third .
an act of jurisdiction says that Colin is owned by the value of 316 million dollars and Paul at a value of 176 million dollars .
the distribution of real estate and cash has proven itself as a pro@@ p@@ stamp .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proposed by Colin made him to leave what I thought for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in a first aff@@ id@@ av@@ it in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice took place on Friday last Friday .
the brothers fight now in order to control over the existing business - including Colin , such as Paul claims that I have excluded him .
Colin argu@@ ed , this is not true , but th@@ rows Paul before , to administ@@ er some owners .
in an early monkey id@@ av@@ it , which was submitted by Colin , he hope he hope to draw the war .
&quot; my Italian heritage writes that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote .
the cost increases in the case , with hundreds of pages with aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , among them Allan My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and from both sides of the law firms .
Ms. De Lut@@ is and her late husband Luigi were Italian immig@@ rant , the dairy bars and delic@@ acy business from the late 1950 @-@ ies and bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick .
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property , which was opened in Colin for the first je@@ ans of the family .
Colin says that he began in West Germany as he was &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lut@@ is says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hop@@ ed to pass their ownership to their sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi said to me that he never wanted to hold the brothers before the court &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no more part of the De Lut@@ is group , with Colin claimed that Mark at the leaving of the company 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars were paid .
in Luke , Luke , Paul says , &quot; says Paul &quot; on the conditions of their financial separation bitter . &quot;
Colin has held very back , although it was a former AF@@ L member , and after a biography from Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire the best friend of TV stars .
Fair@@ fax Media participated with Colin and Paul De Lut@@ is and their lawyers in contact with Colin and Paul De Lut@@ is .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Colin responded by SMS to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really can &apos;t say much &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the case was before the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very sad , that my brother Paul has decided to acc@@ use me and draw our family name by the courts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 Colin in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfil the demands of his brother &apos;s demands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father wouldn &apos;t have thought that Paul and I would like to end in our recent battle , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday , this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our issue is solved in the near future of the courts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Colin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tr@@ um@@ ps new Chief of Staff plans to restri@@ ct the Media Ab@@ st@@ in@@ ence of the President .
others have tried and failed .
perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it .
if yes , he will be the first .
political ico reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to restri@@ ct the information flow to President Tr@@ ump - including reports of the news media - in hope to keep the boss on a constant exchange rate .
here is a piece of repor@@ ter Jos@@ h Daw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , joined his first working day with senior staff , he exhibited a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps White House which he rep@@ ented : bad information that come into the hands of the President .
Kelly told the staff that information should flow through him - whether on paper or in mail@@ ings - because the President would make better decisions if he would get good information . &quot;
wa@@ ist diagnosis makes sense , but others tried to count Tr@@ ump , monitor his media reports .
President Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s relationship to television last decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Tr@@ ump was delayed due to a un@@ fair coverage , it was productive to show him that he received a fair coverage of places that were to convince , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the former election consultant Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February compared to political . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Polit@@ ic@@ os Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote to the time that &quot; the key , Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter custom amongst control , according to six former election campaign officials , insi@@ sts that his personal media consumption has a permanent praise . &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter custom ever &quot; was under control , &quot; is ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous .
perhaps this campaign is something that we don &apos;t know other things - that Tr@@ um@@ ps Twe@@ ets without their inter@@ ventions have been included .
we will never hear something about the twe@@ ets that the tr@@ ump has not sent .
if his employees were able to keep his collabor@@ ators , trouble shooting from him , then their efforts have worth it .
but nobody can consistently prevent Tr@@ ump contro@@ vers@@ y .
a part of the problem is that people in a white house , which are composed of competing parties , always try to present their own agenda by promoting tr@@ ump material that may promote their views from the world .
political - all with this history - reported in May about the pre@@ ference of consultants , to provide the president of strategic reasons .
this was an example described by repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former Tr@@ ump @-@ officials say that Tr@@ ump can react to negative press cuts , especially those with damaged Lec@@ ks , and that he could find out on it from whence they come . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this happened at the end of February when som@@ eb@@ ody gave a copy of a copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet Pro@@ v@@ ok@@ at@@ eurs Charles C. Johnson , who gave the Deputy Chief of Staff to K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; the source behind a cluster will be at the White House .
although Johnson was banned from Twitter because he has offered no specific evidence , or that he expressed false alleg@@ ations made in the past and contra@@ di@@ ct them .
Tr@@ ump read the article and began to ask employees about Wal@@ sh . &quot;
Gold@@ macher added that the then Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary @-@ General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the tr@@ ump . &quot;
how did it work ?
Kelly tries to do it three months later , the same thing .
perhaps he will prove as Pri@@ eb@@ us as Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his im@@ pul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ er still influence influence .
these essential factors make wa@@ ys mission very difficult .
Master searched di@@ min@@ ers get mail from Europ@@ ol
because the address is unknown , the ten@@ th@@ qu@@ ake of the population will pray and hop@@ ed .
the police in all Europe sent back in this summer ( virtual ) postcards to dangerous crimin@@ als on the run .
since the addresses of searched di@@ crimin@@ als are not known from the population , remarks from the population will hope and pray .
Europ@@ ol reported on Friday by the promotion , which follows the &quot; EU Most W@@ an@@ ted &quot; Advent calendar from winter .
the experience would have shown that many vol@@ at@@ ile holiday destinations hide it by Europ@@ ol .
you have put 21 postcards for selected crimin@@ als from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 , there has been the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ al , more than 2.5 million times has been viewed .
36 of the online orders could have been arrested , at least eleven of these are due to the announcement according to the publication on the website .
travelers negoti@@ ate over a gr@@ ating and return to the &apos; million@@ th series &apos;
some of the we@@ al@@ thi@@ est house owner of West Mid@@ lands have again tra@@ ded with some horri@@ fied trav@@ ellers on the foot of war , which have tra@@ ded a field from the municipality in order to re@@ claim a field in front of their hom@@ etown .
the trav@@ ellers have their 20 carav@@ ans on a field outside a we@@ al@@ thy street of soli@@ dly par@@ ked , which is called the &quot; million@@ th series . &quot;
they have horses , babies and an army of transport , after they had been cast out in May , without being thrown out of a tr@@ ench excav@@ ation in May to prevent their inci@@ dents .
the tac@@ kling group found a gap in the defense plants and pressed their vehicles by a section , which remained un@@ diluted to find a track .
&quot; &quot; &quot; without the waste inhabit@@ ant , the Council of Soli@@ fel@@ ong &apos;s Council said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; easy to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an anonymous inhabit@@ ant said : &quot; they were moved there on Monday evening after they were sent by Bentley He@@ ath where they were thrown onto the pass@@ ers .
the Council must be forced through Sch@@ am to implement in fact , since it was us@@ eless in dealing with the problem .
the trav@@ ellers were moved in May , and moved back again .
more came last night , probably today more . &quot;
she added : &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to re@@ use long sub@@ missions to protect their parks .
I dwell at the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to pay my local tax if the Council can &apos;t stop this once . &quot;
a resident who didn &apos;t want to be called , said : &quot; it is ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous , we just have seen the last round of this trip , just to be lo@@ oted by another round .
the numbers have increased this time and you even have seen a horse in the park area . &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of the Council of Soli@@ ds said : &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the country beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to move it as quickly as possible .
in order to support our white collection , it is very important that as possible as many lawyers as anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour in the police , they are asked to call 101 .
this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must check our case . &quot;
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof at Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof , the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is appointed .
the house is re@@ decorated with the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts and is scheduled to be reopened on 1 March next year .
that are good news for the city .
because with the closing of the hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof with the then ambi@@ ance of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof carried out about 30 000 overnight stays per year , and proceeds through the tourist tax .
in the fall of 2014 , in view of the numbers of refugees who came into the county , the hotel building was offered to the Regional Coun@@ cill@@ or as a collective accommodation , which led to controversi@@ al discussion .
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seek@@ ers by setting up a development plan to secure the area as hotel location .
the decision was not controversi@@ al at that time .
but before the Freu@@ den@@ stadt Commander of Julian Oss@@ wald def@@ ended the hotel location and said already from serious inci@@ dents in the house .
he should keep right .
the Group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ otels with headquarters in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ers bought the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it back to a house of the three @-@ star Plus category under the name of Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter building .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ers and one in Bad Her@@ ren@@ al@@ b .
you are hot Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ is@@ en@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the earlier Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof there are already a long time building sh@@ utt@@ container before the entrance , and when you enter the house , extensive renovation work will be made .
the floors were taken out , bl@@ ank@@ ets for partly dismant@@ led , old bath tu@@ bs from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
there &apos;s still much to do in March .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s actually a nice hotel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all should be renewed in the Black Forest .
the rooms are equipped with large guarded showers , the input range is converted , new window will be installed .
all that should be very nice to be beautiful , as Thomas Sch@@ erer is pressed .
&quot; we want to make a piece of jew@@ ellery . &quot;
the swimming pool , wellness area and meeting room belong to the facilities .
it would not be positioned at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad at the high level of the hotels , emphas@@ izes scar@@ fs .
the forest hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms can be set up wide , explains sn@@ erer .
both individual holidays , groups or business partners are to feel well in the hotel .
talks with O@@ B Julian Oss@@ wald and Tourism Director Michael K@@ rau@@ se have already led so sh@@ erer .
the performances of the city are cover@@ ings with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
in accordance with the amount of investment , Thomas Sch@@ erer does not want to define exactly .
just under one million euros , he calcul@@ ates .
the external systems are also brought to the fore@@ man , which is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard is a large terrace that is publicly accessible from the restaurant that is publicly accessible .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia Aff@@ air : U.S. Special Announ@@ ces Grand Jury
in the Russia &apos;s aff@@ air um US President Donald Tr@@ ump is supposed to have appointed Prin@@ cipal Robert Mu@@ eller to a so @-@ called Grand Jury in a report .
in the past few weeks the committee took up the work , the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; wrote in appeal to the familiar people .
the paper evalu@@ ates the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller has widened its investigations and intensi@@ fied .
CN@@ N was reported that there is already first inv@@ itations of the committee in connection with a meeting between the oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. intelligence agencies acc@@ use the Kre@@ m@@ lin to have been targeted in the presidential election campaign in 2016 .
Mu@@ eller exam@@ ines whether there were agreements between tr@@ um@@ ps election team and Moscow .
several men will focus on the investigations as an advisor to rep@@ ublic@@ ans in the election campaign .
according to reports , Mu@@ eller also took more and more tr@@ um@@ ps private and business environment under the micro@@ scope .
the Washington Post &quot; wrote some weeks ago that the special medi@@ ator of Tr@@ ump was personally arranged into the centre and search the alleg@@ ation , whether the President might possibly handic@@ apped the j@@ udi@@ ci@@ ary .
the main task of Grand jur@@ ys is to prove that evidence is to test and decide whether the indictment should be charged .
Grand Jur@@ ys will therefore also be called to count chambers .
mostly they are switched on if it is higher and controversi@@ al cases .
the procedure will always be closed behind closed doors .
the Panel can also be switched on by the Public Prosecutor to download people under E@@ id .
according to the CN@@ N transmitter , pre @-@ inv@@ itations have been issued before the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
people who were involved in the meetings were promp@@ ted to a statement , called it in the report .
in addition , they should provide documents .
in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. also Tr@@ um@@ ps Consult@@ ant and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner also , as well as his wife &apos;s election campaign Paul Man@@ a@@ fort he conducted with the conversation .
legal experts said on Thursday evening in the US television that the obj@@ ection show that Mu@@ eller should not be so@@ ber in his work , and that it should be necessary when it should be necessary to do quickly .
but it must not be hot , that the Grand Jury will be switched on at the end in order to decide on the survey of an indictment .
nevertheless , the inclusion of the committee of the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for concern for President Tr@@ ump .
in the midst of the new re@@ vel@@ ations , the President on Thursday evening took a talk in West Virginia , to depic@@ t Russia &apos;s aff@@ air as a campaign of his political opponents .
&quot; the Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; said Tr@@ ump .
the topic give the Democrats an option to feel good , because they have nothing else to talk about that . &quot;
his special advis@@ ers T@@ y Cob@@ b explained in a statement , he is ignor@@ ant from the translation of a Grand Jury .
but they usually work in the secret , he stressed .
the White House proposed any actions that accelerated the work of special speech to &quot; f@@ aire &quot; mode .
the former FB@@ I boss James Com@@ ey said three times , that not to be determined against the President .
I have no reason to accept that something has changed , it &apos;s further stated in the Declaration .
Mu@@ eller was only used since Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey fired .
because of this run@@ way , alleg@@ ations made against Tr@@ ump came out , he gave the j@@ udi@@ ci@@ ary to the j@@ udi@@ ci@@ ence .
Com@@ ey said in June before a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump made him a setting of investigations against the then national security consultant Michael Fl@@ ynn .
the president stands for the investigation under large pressure .
according to the presentation of US media , the White House gathered some material against the special medi@@ ator and its staff .
the dis@@ band@@ ed spec@@ ulations about it if Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller may be released .
unlike an independent special medi@@ ator of the Congress such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate aff@@ air around the later , Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position he could be fired by the President of the Ministry of Justice .
several must@@ ators of both parties want to prevent this step .
two groups of Republi@@ can and democratic trans@@ missions were submitted to the Thursday legisl@@ ature , after which the special medi@@ ator could not be released more so easy .
Antar@@ c@@ tica : gigantic Eis@@ berg drives in Antar@@ c@@ tica
in the West@@ ant@@ ar@@ Arctic , a gigantic ice@@ berg has solved just over seven times of Berlin@@ s from Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is .
this shared the Zar@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ Weg@@ ener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the above one trillion tonnes heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometers long Kol@@ oss t@@ les now to the north and will probably be two , three years until it be melted .
it is with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers of one of the largest sk@@ ill@@ ings that researchers have registered over the last three decades .
there is no danger for people from him .
to what extent , climate change has played a role in the crash of ice , is un@@ clear after research information .
however , since about 30 years there is a series of unusual inter@@ c@@ tures of iron car@@ c@@ asses in the region , writes the US research center for snow and ice ( NS@@ IDC ) in a factor .
according to many researchers , these are linked to global warming .
now the Kol@@ oss Kol@@ oss was a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is so far .
Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is floating on the sea and is fed by great gl@@ ac@@ iers .
it always grows into the sea and leaves regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is located south of South America almost at the top of the ant@@ ar@@ ctic Peninsula .
North of this scra@@ ping &apos; balance was the balance of w@@ ax@@ ing and dis@@ rup@@ ted some years ago .
a complete shot spring is broken there , A@@ WI @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen writes .
there is some evidence that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is in danger because the front edge has never pulled back as far as at present .
in addition , the ice plate at voltage and can be cr@@ ushed , if at a key point there is a piece of pick @-@ up .
the melt of Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is and Eis@@ berg increases the sea level as they swim on the water and mix as much water as it yields after the melting itself .
however , the loss of the scra@@ pers leads to the sea that gl@@ acier can flow directly into the sea and much faster than before .
this could possibly increase the level of sea level , however , only in the low degree , the British research project writes the observation of Antar@@ c@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is according to A@@ WI @-@ information with almost 50 000 square kilometres , the fourth biggest sh@@ an@@ fe@@ is of Antar@@ c@@ tica .
at the crossing from the mainland , it is up to 700 metres thick , on the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters .
there will be regular regularly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although there is no direct connection to climate change , the ice sign comes into a dangerous position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ Le@@ ary from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the far retreat since the beginning of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confirmed &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
among scientists have been disp@@ uted whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is now grow and may be together , and possibly together , his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man and said : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last decades .
even if these researchers have not lead the crash of this gigantic iron on climate change , however , in recent decades , the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula are cr@@ ushed out of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
this long drawing of Antar@@ c@@ tica extends towards South America .
according to data of the research programme British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has dropped by 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s .
the temperature increase has contributed to the decline .
the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have passed over the past 50 years by some three degrees and tell them about the areas where the temperature is on the fastest .
CDU wants house tariff at staff
because it is more difficult to occupy freely to become free , the CDU , from the German Emplo@@ yers of Emplo@@ yers to compete for more attractive .
just before the summer break , the Kre@@ ist@@ ag has reached 41 new jobs in the administration .
more than 1,@@ 100 employees and officials work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 trainees have left their first working day .
the instru@@ ctors at the circle are obviously very desired .
some 620 applications were expected to be recorded in this year .
nevertheless , the circle continues to handle staff to cope with the increased requirements and tasks .
at present there are not in the circle of M@@ ett@@ mann as close as 50 .
we are looking for doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration .
the CDU would like to take part in the Kre@@ ist@@ ag together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG initiative and def@@ endants in the administration of the United States .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the administration is expected to work after the request of the parties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concept for personal recovery and staff development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is to cover not only short @-@ term necess@@ ities on expertise , but future oriented to the applic@@ ability is called .
the overall concept should show itself according to the inside and exter@@ n@@ ally , concrete measures for trans@@ verse beginners and include a training offensive , ask for CDU , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
that sounds already after a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personal problems which is not known so far .
other towns will advertise good officials and employees and offer attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is from a regular &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of the public employer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this comes to a high number of employees , the disease or age @-@ age from the service .
the highest time to hand , so that no more places remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter Pe@@ oples , president of the CDU , continues to go beyond the joint request by his party .
he had long had long surprise in the Kre@@ ist@@ ag for a f@@ aust@@ o @-@ thick surprise when he publicly presented the number of personnel in question and the remaining parties .
people want to check all the possibilities that make a withdrawal from the municipal employer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we come here in short term to a satisfactory solution , the county administration with trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with circular cities - a pet cost increases &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; so people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this means that the CDU , the employees and civil servants are trying to pay better than the tariff for public service .
the sal@@ aries are currently pre @-@ written , enh@@ ancements or more money there is only if you are changing into a higher level , oriented to professional years .
but the tasks of the circle has grown steadily in recent years .
a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be set up , in which employees take care of the provisions of the new Pro@@ stitution Protection Act .
not least through the rising number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ director Martin Richter a problem : you have too little staff .
Italy Ap@@ proxim@@ ate the tone to NGO @-@ Mig@@ rants rescue boat
in Italy , NGOs , war@@ ned boats for migrants in the Mediterranean , war@@ ns that they may not continue to continue their new rules for their operations .
&quot; if NGOs do not under@@ sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can work , &quot; said Interior Marco Min@@ n@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a .
Min@@ nit@@ is warning a day after the Italian authorities had conf@@ is@@ cated a boat of the German aid organisation &apos; Youth R@@ ettet &apos; because their team had worked effectively with tra@@ ff@@ lers in a way which facilit@@ ated the illegal immig@@ ration .
the aid organisation , which has been in operation only since a year , refused to ut@@ ili@@ ze the Italian citizenship of Am@@ bro@@ gio Cart@@ osi@@ o .
&quot; for us and remains the salvation of human life our top priority . so we are sorry that we can &apos;t operate at the moment in the search and rescue zone , &quot; said the organization in a position on social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can do all debts that are currently raised , only after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities were the boat of &apos; Youth R@@ ettet &apos; , which monitors I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October .
it is thought that his crew of infl@@ atable migrants will be on board which will direct them directly from human tra@@ ff@@ lers , and that the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers can be used , so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such a meeting had allegedly took place only 1.3 miles before Libyan coast , according to the acquisition of the citizenship , whose contents were published by Italian Media .
the crew is suspected to susp@@ end on the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , which monitors li@@ fel@@ lows in zone of humanitarian reasons and not from any other moti@@ fs .
under the code of conduct , boats must be used as the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , primarily an Italian police officer , which monitors their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs who are involved in search and rescue operations have already been declared to hold to the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be un@@ necessary but acceptable , because they would not have &quot; essential changes or disabilities &quot; for their rescue actions .
among those who want to sign up is the Nobel Prize @-@ winner organization Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
Min@@ n@@ iti meanwhile said that the number of migrants who came to Italy after the rescue measures in Italy came in recent weeks , that efforts to strengthen Libya &apos;s efforts and cooperation with the local bourgeoisie .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last days we started to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he gave plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month on economic development initiatives and with Cher@@ ad , Niger , and Mali to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe .
asc@@ ents and tri@@ als
nine W@@ eil@@ er@@ mer B@@ iker , who met in Berlin &apos;s out@@ post , and two guest driver met in Wach@@ enheim in the North Sea to enjoy four days of tri@@ als and sights .
there were three left guides available .
the accommodation in Wach@@ enh@@ eimer Valley proved itself as good starting point for tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est from Wach@@ enheim was a welcome extra .
the first tour led to hot summer temperatures along the vineyards of the Micha@@ el@@ sk@@ ap@@ elle above D@@ ei@@ des@@ heim .
the view@@ points followed , partly on towers , of which one could find far above the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald and the pre @-@ bearing levels .
between there , there was again longer asc@@ ents , for the long tri@@ als .
on the second day it went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to Sal@@ ine and to the People &apos;s State Market .
the look@@ out spot to the look@@ out point , connected by &quot; flo@@ wi@@ ge &quot; Tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents .
at the last two days there were again many altitude difference .

in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim at@@ met@@ a the bi@@ kers in the free@@ z@@ hal@@ at@@ orio hal@@ lowed Sole .

after 173 kilometres and almost 4500 meters of altitude , the group had learned the Pf@@ äl@@ zer forest from his best side - sporty and cultural .
console instead of lawn - Bundesliga equipment for e @-@ sport
sit the sports stars in the future of computer consoles , instead of through wind and weather about the stadium to fight ?
fact : E @-@ Sports has become a serious business to become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high g@@ ages .
this also known the first federal states that increasingly eng@@ age in this area .
at the beginning of 2015 V@@ f@@ L Wolfsburg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last of the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded a E @-@ Sport division in mid @-@ July and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to inspir@@ ing all new young target groups for V@@ f@@ B &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the Board of Jochen R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is safe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is still a few clubs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on this train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
next weekend , the FIFA World Cup FIFA organizes the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; where the Gam@@ er of various clubs compete against each other .
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfsburg , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or PS@@ V Eindhoven will be qualified .
Robin D@@ utt also looks great potential in E @-@ Sport .
the ex @-@ Trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen has meanwhile become a agency for virtual football players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real football needs to settle in particular with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ old that young people still go into the stadium , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 52 year old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : they tried to capture all possible markets , especially the Asian , to conquer .
with prominent e @-@ athletes under contract , one could be online far from more often on these markets , than just once a year the Federal Republic shall be sent to Asia only once a year .
what is it exactly ?
when E @-@ Sports will play computer games like &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike , or just hit the FIFA simulation FIFA to the competition level .
long , as in normal sport , Li@@ gen was established , in which the professionals compete against each other .
and in Asia Pacific , E @-@ Sports is already part of the official program .
but is it a real sport art ?
for many , the performance is safe and needy .
also Ingo F@@ rob@@ ous has made herself long with the question .
for the Professor at the German Sports College in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because it is competent and many biological and physical reactions show that you also find in classical sports - for example , increased heart rate , stress actions , hor@@ m@@ onal changes .
there is also cogn@@ itive performance , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and quick reaction ability .
professional gam@@ ers should not only exercise at the console but also exercise their body and keep the diet .
&quot; the f@@ itte player is a good player . &quot;
however , F@@ rob@@ ous looks like problems : &quot; d@@ oping will always be a theme . &quot;
controls are heavy through online games , and the scene lack@@ ed the structures of classic sports .
scientists have positive positive impact on the high integ@@ rative effect of the E @-@ Sports .
players are internationally on the road , which is like a large global family , there is no intercultural shirts .
a study of business consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) tells the E @-@ Sport a rapid growth ahead .
in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented , mainly in advertising , sponsor@@ ing and large tournaments .
in three years , turnover is expected to be 130 million .
against the nearly 2.4 billion euros of the Bundesliga , this is true .
however , the E @-@ Sports is not far from the well established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice @-@ hockey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte @-@ Consult@@ ants .
there are many countries for many countries .
large markets are Asia and the USA where Ex @-@ basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ guez is participating in the US Team N@@ RG e@@ Sports .
Hollywood Ac@@ tor Ash@@ ton K@@ ut@@ cher invests in the e@@ Sport @-@ Wet@@ tan@@ kers Uni@@ kr@@ n .
some in Europe also does a lot .
in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sports was introduced as a class@@ room , F@@ rob@@ ous says .
in the Netherlands and France , the football @-@ first liga @-@ Ver@@ one according to D@@ utt has been committed to establish an e @-@ sport department .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Compar@@ ison of Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; V@@ f@@ B @-@ board R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only in nost@@ al@@ gia to fall , and the old times are to clari@@ fy , today is no longer enough .
it is therefore , to preserve the tradition of the association , but the company was set up at the same time on the modern market .
&quot; we live in a dig@@ ging world , &quot; also D@@ utt also believes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not possible to keep that only in football , just as it was always . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of their convic@@ tion behind G@@ nights and five years have been exposed to prob@@ ation .
on 13 July 2014 , Carter was sentenced by Conrad Roy , who took his life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at his hearing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My family is innocent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to stay free until his appeal .
she was con@@ fron@@ ted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but their legal representatives argu@@ ed that both them and Mr Roy suffered from a psychological illness .
dressed in red tro@@ users and a cream coloured bl@@ ouse , Carter da with tears in the eyes , with folded hands and down@@ wards eyes when they were condemned .
&quot; their actions took Conrad Roy , &quot; the lawyer &apos;s lawyer said .
&quot; she finished his life to make her own better .
she has no responsibility , &quot; she said .
&quot; she has no Reu@@ e . &quot;
but Car@@ ters lawyer told it , it is a &quot; horri@@ fic inverter which they were completely un@@ fortun@@ ate . &quot;
Judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said , he did not found that their &quot; age or ri@@ pen@@ ess or even their spirit @-@ illness brought a significant influence on their actions . &quot;
a state prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys Mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who told it &quot; no day , in whom I &apos;m not bet@@ ro@@ asted the loss of my beloved Son .
I would like that he is proud of me and how I am proud of all . I try to be with all my pain , which we shall bear for eternity with us , for his sisters , &quot; says it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ d@@ yn Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said that they will never participate in the knowledge of her brother or would never be an a@@ unt for his children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no more this one person , with whom I had been working every day since my birth is a pain , I will always retain for the rest of my life forever &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case appears to set a right precision in Massachusetts because there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime to request others to request suicide .
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in a vehicle by a carbon mon@@ oxide po@@ is@@ oning in 2014 .
the case with@@ drew national attention , after Car@@ ters text@@ books reveal that they encour@@ ages him to end his life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spring , spring from a building , do you know yourself , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said in several messages that she had sent to his death during the two weeks before his death . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the sight of his suicide she wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must do it , Conrad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything you need to do , is to switch to the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judges Mon@@ iz said that Carter sought attention through the death of Roy and ordered that they should benefit through any of your press .
the case has the legal opinion .
among the few that Carter def@@ aul@@ ted , Am@@ anda Knox , who was convicted in 2007 for murder of their British co @-@ inhabitants in Italy before she was acquitted two years ago .
Ms. Knox , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Michelle Carter deserv@@ es compassion and help , not in prison . &quot;
Joshua K@@ imm@@ ich : learn from the new mini @-@ Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
that Joshua took part in the Audi Cup as a captain in the Audi Cup , is no co@@ incidence .
FC Bayern S@@ ign up a large season on the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner for a large season - Extra motivation .
anything that was different at his place in the cabin , which saw Joshua K@@ imm@@ ich immediately , even if the extra garment was very small , very small .
but because far and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , of course no , Philipp Lah@@ m , and also no Manuel New to see , he made his appeal to the arm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trainer didn &apos;t have announced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; telling the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner , after his first use as Bavaria @-@ Captain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
good , the entry would have better run than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but the sign of the Coach could also be as de@@ mar@@ ed .
not the eight years older Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal was not chosen by youth leaders , deb@@ unk@@ ers and just out of the Holiday professionals existing C @-@ El@@ f , but he was chosen .
sugar is distributed to those who want to keep a lot to those who want to hold on La@@ une .
so those who want to get out of Lah@@ ain@@ es , a small extra motivation can only be used good .
K@@ imm@@ ich confirmed : &quot; this is what a player wants to take responsibility : responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old as mini @-@ Lah@@ m over the field .
right back , that is now its position , the white Bin@@ d at arm did its rest .
and at all , K@@ imm@@ ich worked on this starting formation as the one who can take the ru@@ in also at the best .
he gave instructions , tried to turn the un@@ inserted tro@@ upe .
he had a look for the whole , while many others were busy with himself .
Vi@@ dal thus , to play his lack of fitness ( fol@@ ly hardly ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches made it out of the achievements of the Asia voyage to follow the achievements of Asia &apos;s journey ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le therefore did not fall negative at their first performance in Bavaria @-@ Tri@@ als .
this is quite good .
Sü@@ le ran apart from K@@ imm@@ ich , Rud@@ y before the ri@@ f@@ le , both ag@@ ated sover@@ eign .
the well @-@ occupied Nap@@ oli storm was heavily bad@@ ly , in addition , Sü@@ le tried to succeed in a couple of time .
his colleague Rud@@ y gave heed that the result was &quot; not so , as we hop@@ ed it . &quot;
but also he showed an ordinary performance at the debut .
game shift , Tem@@ po@@ on : &quot; for this style I was also brought . &quot;
as un@@ used this Bayern world still exists for the new length , one looked at the end of game .
Rud@@ y was there for example in the Kat@@ ak@@ om@@ bs not one or two , but definitely six or seven interviews .
K@@ imm@@ ich passed after a few cris@@ p statements in the back of his new fellow player .
there he heard of the sweet@@ ness an interesting proposition : &quot; what here goes , I &apos;ve already noticed .
you just need to win any game in Bavaria . &quot;
after all , he does not need to raise the new one more .
Al@@ aba Moti@@ v@@ ates Ö@@ FB @-@ Damen
David Al@@ aba believes on the success of our Ö@@ FB @-@ Damen
Austria &apos;s most famous foot@@ b@@ aller fell short before the game on Twitter and the Ö@@ FB @-@ ladies had all the best wishes .
the Bayern @-@ Leg@@ ion@@ aire is a quasi @-@ mate of Ö@@ FB @-@ Chap@@ ters in Schn@@ ader@@ beck and fi@@ e@@ bert with our shop with our shop .
the 2009 Austrian football player of the year and Champions League winner should be a special motivation .

company satisfied with Rhineland @-@ corn@@ ering Minister : economy lo@@ ges W@@ iss@@ ing pace
it was often ignor@@ ant , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as Ev@@ eline Lem@@ ke ( Green ) , was still the Minister for Economic Affairs of Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
this shows itself after more than one year , in which the new Minister of Economic Affairs Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak on T V @-@ request from a change in economic policy - and t@@ add@@ les at the same time the old Minister .
Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association Tri@@ ger Company ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; Wis@@ sing g@@ athers the desires of the economy , and the Lem@@ ke has blocked all of them . &quot;
in the infrastructure policy , Nat@@ us sees the infrastructure policy : the bridge of the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au stands at the priority list of the country now .
this year , the ministry is hop@@ ed for a plan procedure until 2021 is intended to be the building right .
an important role in the plans of the country also plays the western leadership of Trier , which is in the pre @-@ ur@@ gent matter of the federal highway .
the aim is to take the route in December 2020 , says Minist@@ eri@@ dic@@ tor Cornelia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
Nat@@ us sees a sign to support regional , but internationally competing company .
in Trier , the Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( I@@ HK ) Trier is aiming at the wine a Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate label to increase the sales volumes in Super@@ markets and to stop the trend of German wine exports for ten years .
Moreover , Wis@@ dom has an open ear for people who want to establish an own company , lo@@ dges the I@@ HK .
in the new master bonus , the Handwerk@@ skammer Trier is an additional incenti@@ ve for young apprentices , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
a premium of 1000 Euro is provided for the constitu@@ ent championship check and 2500 Euro if graduates are independent within ten years after the master &apos;s education .
the house@@ work list for the country remains long .
at the planned road construction , there will be quickly facts , at the same time , it commands the country on the necessary staff , says Jan Glock@@ auer , the main leader of the I@@ HK Trier .
of 56 new engineers who wants to take mobility at the state duty of mobility , only 29 positions have been occupied .
the I@@ HK calls for orders to use more orders to external offices .
CDU Fra@@ ction vi@@ ze Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf refers to the calculations of the host family , the country spend more than 20 million euros in the preservation of the country &apos;s roads in 2017 and 2018 .
in addition to Frank Nat@@ us , Frank Nat@@ us also anticip@@ ates a concept of the country as it wants to solve experts in the region .
in addition , the present broad@@ band expansion was also in the country .
in 2016 , regional companies had evaluated the power supply in a I@@ HK @-@ survey only with the note 3.4 .
they decide on mol@@ ded Internet connections and abor@@ tions .
ex @-@ Economic Minister Ev@@ eline Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and is still seated at the Supervisory Board of the wind power company Pro Wind .
the Green leader left Lem@@ ke on April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe , where she had already dre@@ amed the field after four months .
Audi is expected to change 85@@ 0,000 diesel vehicles - auto manufacturers at con@@ fron@@ ted with a counter@@ action .
one day before the announcement of Audi said BMW that it would offer to update the software in more than 35@@ 0,000 vehicles .
the BMW Group said , the company is the opinion that &quot; there are smar@@ ter options as driving restrictions , &quot; and thus moved to European cities - including Munich , where BMW resident is based on diesel vehicles - diesel vehicles .
Daimler announced on Tuesday , that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the companies as a return call .
European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
but the nitrogen oxi@@ des that em@@ itting diesel engines are regarded as car@@ cin@@ ogenic and may cause as@@ thma .
the cost of car manufacturers , facilities to neutr@@ alize the diesel vehicles of diesel vehicles will also take advantage of what it makes difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of ignore the massive auto companies to ignore and ignore the problem of the problem .
the company try to avoid the error of Volkswagen , which could regul@@ ate the use of so @-@ called @-@ off @-@ devices to regul@@ ate the regulations when a car was tested but under normal driving conditions .
several employees of Volkswagen were indicted in the United States , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of the Ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ ch@@ eo Giovanni Pam@@ io , is Italian and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be placed in the United States before the Court .
at the beginning of this year , Audi has been involved in German criminal investigations in Volkswagen , after the authorities have accused of use an system to handle the emission regulations in Europe , and a request that focused on the United States has been expanded .
the inclusion of Audi into the investigation could be tough at the time of Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer carries out disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ately to profit from Volkswagen .

Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ us@@ ation and the laugh@@ ter against the g@@ rief
Mor@@ di@@ llo was one of the most widely published Cart@@ oon character , the Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ ess of his figures are his trademark .
even with 85 the Argentin@@ ian became even more and works in a film .
his message : laugh@@ ter , &quot; because there &apos;s too much sorrow in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immig@@ rants in Buenos Aires .
in the first few years as an artist , he encouraged himself as a cartoon for lucky maps - which is fru@@ str@@ ated .
&quot; the happy day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he said once .
after stations in Lima , New York and Paris , he succeeded in the end of the 60s . with the publication of his Cart@@ o@@ ons in Paris Match &quot; and then also in the &quot; star &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
in China Mor@@ di@@ llo found lots of fans .
and again , the artists were inspired by cities .
large , quiet Mor@@ di@@ llo figures are moving into drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
at the early morning he s@@ itt@@ eth his own details today at the drawing today , working for nearly ten hours .
about cal@@ end@@ ars , puzzles , books for Gross and Klein , T @-@ Shirts , pl@@ ush favorites and watches are still a lot of spread around the world .
he has also been working in a cartoon animation and a TV series with its figures since six years .
the main person in the movie &quot; Crazy Island &quot; is a gi@@ raffe - Mor@@ an &apos;s most popular beast in his drawings , which has a thousands of feet as a counter @-@ player .
for the first time his figures are talking in the 3D movie , which should be placed on the chin @-@ up wall .
&quot; I don &apos;t know what they say , it is strange for me , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo .
the script will not be written by him .
this is why he rather reli@@ es on the TV series , which is produced like his original drawings , wor@@ t@@ less .
Lav@@ ender from the Provence threat@@ ens Climate Change
he became a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change .
the Lav@@ ender is due to the conditions in d@@ rought and due to the in@@ crimin@@ ating insec@@ ts and due to the diseases of the insec@@ ts , which are trying to find solutions , great head@@ aches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the agricultural research institute CR@@ I@@ EP@@ P@@ AM in Provence , said : &quot; the Lav@@ ender in Provence is effective because the plant was exposed to climate change in spring much less rain and in the autumn much more .
this has impact on the lif@@ esp@@ an of lav@@ ender .
there is also a small Z@@ ik@@ ade , a micro @-@ bacteria , the d@@ warf @-@ ca@@ des transfers , and with very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and it is much on the game .
lav@@ ender oil lo@@ ys not only for vacation , it is also very popular for perf@@ ume and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of very long vegetable oils with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , UN@@ TER@@ EN@@ TW@@ IC@@ K@@ EL@@ TE and either missing or weak@@ ened .
so we have less parts with essential oil . &quot;
for solutions that are considered to be considered , a better water distribution and slow@@ down of evap@@ oration from the ground , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are resistant to dry .
the town of Ge@@ isa will be celebrating its 1200 @-@ year anniversary .

the assassination of a journalist under@@ scores the growing threat in Mexico
the employee of the weekly Ri@@ odo@@ ce is usually on Wedn@@ esdays to review their plans for the recent chaos within the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a through which organized crime , corrupt civil servants and un@@ audi@@ ble drugs .
but this day , in the shadow of her own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
it was told them that it is important to change their rout@@ ines .
two high @-@ level journalists discuss what saf@@ er feel : you should take their children to the office , who were the aim of a attack with granite or at home in 2009 .
safety experts have submitted three words to a table on the front of the room : ad@@ versaries , Neutr@@ ale , Al@@ lies .
they ask repor@@ ter , names for any column - no evidence is necessary , perc@@ ep@@ tions and abdom@@ inal feel .
there are drugs dirty , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected to stand on the vote list of the government or the cart@@ els , a catalog of crimin@@ als that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there are no rest of violence , and during all the country the bodies are frequent , there are more journalists at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto took office in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are after attacks and thre@@ ats under federal law and until now there were at least seven dead in seven countries .
among the latter , their editors and their In@@ spir@@ ator of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , the co @-@ founder Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books about violence in connection with drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his lack is felt deep , although his presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Val@@ dez , which shows his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; hangs on the facade of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce @-@ building . two repor@@ ters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez , carry T @-@ shirts , which show his sm@@ iling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop will take place less than two months after his death , and the repor@@ ters discuss their shared topics , trau@@ ma , their night@@ mar@@ es , ins@@ om@@ nia , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although in 2010 , a special Prosec@@ ution was established to process the cases of journalists , according to the Committee for the Protection of journalists only two pen@@ alties .
as with most thousands of murder , which are associated with drugs and organis@@ ational crimes , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are only rare in court .
at Ri@@ odo@@ ce , they still have to treat the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are in@@ tr@@ ample , and even though the Ter@@ rain is still more toler@@ able .
without information about the mur@@ derer , without righteousness , the meeting for the discussion of safety , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very stup@@ id , turning my time in this workshop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as long as we know not the why we don &apos;t know everything . &quot;
on the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the state capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he only managed to drive a couple of blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was forced by two men . it was shot out of his car and was shot on it for 12 times , probably because of the name of the newspaper - that is translated with &quot; 12th river . &quot;
the cap went away in his car and damaged it in the vicinity .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but there &apos;s practically nothing about silence in the theme of Val@@ dez .
since Gu@@ z@@ mans was arrested in the past year and the extra@@ dition in the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a became one of the bloody batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , as riv@@ eting fra@@ ctions are fighting here to fill the vacuum .
it does nothing that anyone can be shot in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day or more people on the road or that the cemetery is full of en@@ ched , two @-@ story mouse ol@@ ques for drugs , which are larger than many houses for the living .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if only one map is the control of the coastal road with its valuable ports and drugs trade routes in the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot;
yet despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware that Val@@ dez was aware of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , with the gu@@ ilt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ understanding have contributed to the murder .
first published in February the publication of an interview with Dam@@ asc@@ o L@@ op@@ ez , a leader of a riv@@ alled cart@@ el fra@@ ctions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ mans sons .
this publication may have been off@@ ended , the Gang@@ members bought each copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ k .
the second fault was that Val@@ dez was not to force to force , after the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper , which had published the same story to leave the country on its own safety .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing will be regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he had so long survived , that his friends and colleagues ann@@ ah@@ ms that he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced repor@@ ter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 when he sold five colleagues to the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism without turning to the noise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the time the newspaper had been a reputation because of the cour@@ age@@ ous and hon@@ our@@ able coverage , and sales and advertising took part .
repor@@ ters love to publish hard drive investigations without fear of c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship , and the readers were fascin@@ ated by the publication that nobody could read anything else .
eight years after the foundation of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors Cab@@ ot Prize &quot; for their coverage in Latin America .
in the same year Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee for the Protection of journalists for his courage to persec@@ utions on the Mexican &apos;s history , wherever they lead them .
he gave himself up to that he was afraid .
&quot; I would like to live , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J Award .
drug tra@@ ff@@ in Sin@@ alo@@ a is a way of life , &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV in October last October .
&quot; you must take the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would not want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what did you do in view of many dead ... why did you not tell what went before ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ odo@@ ce team van@@ ished Val@@ dez , the fun bird that was like a harbour worker , the friend who was generous with emb@@ race and advice was a teacher who knew how one survived .
they trusted in his routine .
he would always bear his hat .
he would always be to El Guay@@ abo , the bar opposite the office , and there always sit on the same table .
well , they ask : was his love for the routine his destruction ?
his death has also forced them to ask their own concerns about how they can do their work on the best and stay alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t like to deal with their wives , their children , their secret stores , their secret start and run@@ ways &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ scen@@ ic and self @-@ accounting .
trust his own inst@@ alls .
if it sm@@ ells wrong , stay away from it .
the trouble is , the editor of Ri@@ odo@@ ce And@@ res Vill@@ ar@@ real that &quot; od@@ our is a sense that can be get@@ away ... and then the cause of Javier happens . &quot;
the old rules , such as he and others say , are not in Sin@@ alo@@ a , not even as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states , in which a toxic mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative sm@@ ug@@ es , weak institutions and corrupt government officials .
the landscape is constantly changing .
in the room where employees from Ri@@ odo@@ ce to security training were suddenly not allowed . days previously announced that sp@@ y@@ ware that is sold exclusively to governments to monitoring journalists and activists in Mexico .
without , two polic@@ emen sought protection against the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ story building in a mid @-@ class quarter of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in the sh@@ ear , some of the repor@@ ters asked whether those officers belong to the 50 per cent of the polic@@ emen who also called the governor himself as a tru@@ st@@ worthy .
it is months ago , since the repor@@ ter have gone into the mountain landscape where the drug bound de fac@@ to are under control .
for the issue of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ce has ro@@ asted on three main stories .
there was the assassination of the brother of the former famous Box@@ ers Juli@@ o Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an ex@@ pos@@ é to the state spending , concentrated on the hom@@ etown of the governor .
and there was a group that is in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , one block from the Office of the Prosecutor , a kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word about it that was ab@@ duc@@ ted or as it happened , so was careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favorite local local drug tra@@ ders and authorities .
a repor@@ ter learned from public records that the restaurant has been registered under the name of a policy that the Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( pr@@ i ) belongs to almost the whole century all political levels .
recently , several pr@@ i @-@ govern@@ ors were accused of corruption of corruption of corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real asked repor@@ ter to write about predic@@ ting inci@@ dents in this locality , among them one , in whom a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military incident .
only a few months before the readers visited the column of Val@@ dez to be found on the best inform@@ al source about kidn@@ apping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had already known what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El FLACO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of its slim body nature . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
the office of Val@@ dez was dedicated to the storage room for signs and st@@ ic@@ kers , dedicated to the murder of journalists , because the employees have become something that they never expected : activ@@ ist in the name of the press .
repor@@ ter Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez s@@ akes a few signs and went to a demonstration on the next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist for the Office of the State Prosecutor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed , in the western state of Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ an .
a burned body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA tests that it is .
throughout the country , journalists became stronger , by organizing the &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; organized by organized protests and buildings .
this day , Director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez was gone in Washington and tries to collect international support for the justice in the Val@@ dez case .
during a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assassination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities to gather journalists and destroy them , because they said the truth .
she has since then asked that it is divided again by the government because it is concerned that their rage has injured their mission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were organised by organis@@ ational crimes , about the government officials and an equally valid society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that repor@@ ters are not only killed by drugs , but also on the order of policy and security forces that led with the organized crime under a ceiling .
in the past year , the media group &quot; Ar@@ tic@@ ulo 19 &quot; has more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials .
&quot; in Mexico you die , because they would like that you do the mouth , Ram@@ i@@ rez said .
obviously the mur@@ derer have a deter@@ rent effect .
no one will forget the death of the blo@@ g@@ inist Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
your body was found along with a note that allegedly signed by Z@@ etas @-@ Cart@@ el : &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and headphones were next to its cut head .
some branches have chosen to close the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border of Ch@@ ihu@@ ah@@ ua after the assassination of Cor@@ ros@@ lava in March .
other things continue to make El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo after the assassination of her director in 2004 .
in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed to the drug board with a leading article on the front page with the heading &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists have fled from their home states or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it &apos;s hard to find work in exile , and still observe the streets and search for d@@ angers .
and sometimes they are ch@@ ased , as evi@@ den@@ ced by the photographer Ruben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in a residence in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who continue to remain and the job , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once said Po@@ et , gives to that the drug tra@@ des him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico comes to hell and therefore I became repor@@ ter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was completed , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce were sitting on the brush before the office and d@@ row@@ ned beer than once all of her phones started .
a series of shooting paintings with Band@@ en@@ ri@@ val@@ en and security forces near the seaside Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war es@@ cal@@ ated further , as it was promised by a number of Kart@@ ell messages in the region .
they have published the news on the Ri@@ odo@@ ce website from the on @-@ board walls .
the front page had to be changed to the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens he@@ ul@@ ts near - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the polic@@ emen who held the guard to see if they were in read@@ iness .
if they had fear at all , they did not show them .
among the strong portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for all Sin@@ alo@@ a , the employees of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his tracks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you just think of it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the same day was murdered on the same day , the intern@@ ship was assassin@@ ated to send them to the streets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ouflage to soak for his enemies
at first sight , it looks like a statue , when a fri@@ gh@@ tening .
now researchers found that the first findings of the incredible Nash@@ or@@ ns of a Canadian mountain worker were so well preserved that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the Din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so good to determine that they could even determine that his fl@@ am@@ ous skin of red@@ dish Braun was - and they said they would have had something of a &quot; un@@ quiet past . &quot;
the report in the &quot; Current Biology &quot; journal called him as &quot; the ster@@ ile d@@ din@@ osau@@ rs , who ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs specimens of the world . &quot;
F@@ ossil is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ sh@@ rier who lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ace@@ ous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
its incredibly well preserved state has researchers that it seems to describe it as &quot; really remarkable . &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the paved plant stress has the best preserved F@@ ossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk when he was on 21 March 2011 at Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alberta , Canada , green .
he met something of what seemed to be seen from the surrounding Rock Command at Plat@@ ze , and decided to look at a closer look .
F@@ ossil discovered that F@@ ossil was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pale@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to cover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy duty .
after all these hard work , the final result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you just blind a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that it slept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the main aut@@ or Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum , where the creature is visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it will enter science history as one of the most beautiful and most preserved Din@@ osau@@ rs copies - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the Din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
researchers found that this plant bro@@ ress@@ ors , although it is covered with a arm@@ or , and resem@@ bles a carrying tank , probably threatened by flesh f@@ ress@@ ish din@@ osau@@ rs .
the heavily damaged din@@ osau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ouflage to hide themselves . it used a control technology that is known as counter@@ f@@ att@@ ing , which is also used by many modern animals .
this could have been allowed to mix well into its surroundings and to soak his enemies , experts predi@@ ct that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million years old creation from the family of the No@@ dos@@ sier has made first head@@ lines in May and is now in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and found it Bo@@ re@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli named after the museum techn@@ ician Mark Mitchell , one of a team that has spent more than 7.000 hours to cover it carefully .
the amazing conservation of the specimen made it Dr. Mitchell and a international team of scientists , the pattern and the form of sheds and arm@@ or over his body .
they discovered the sh@@ ady sh@@ ady , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , meaning that the top of the creature was dar@@ ker than its under@@ side .
although the sh@@ ady sh@@ ady is custom@@ ary , the results are surprising as the size of Bo@@ re@@ op@@ el@@ ta is far beyond the living animals .
it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ rs of the din@@ osau@@ rs should be ch@@ ased by meat f@@ ress@@ ors Din@@ osau@@ rs , evolution of the con@@ front@@ ation as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals that use the sh@@ ady sh@@ ady , remember to remember , zeb@@ ra or belt @-@ animals - are much smaller and viol@@ ate as a prey , which was sign@@ alized that this No@@ dos@@ sier was exposed to a real struggle .
&quot; strong Rau@@ b@@ tier behaviour on a massive , highly ge@@ ared din@@ osau@@ rs show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs cra@@ b@@ ating of the C@@ ret@@ ace@@ ous must have been , &quot; said Brown .
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ rs was brown @-@ brown .
scientists continue to investigate the animal on critics about his life , including its ser@@ rated Dar@@ fur , to figure out what it has eaten as its last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ rs , when he died , moved into a river , and moved into the sea , where he sank on the back to the sea .
since that time Alberta were so warm like South flu@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably spread much more land@@ ward than they are today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this No@@ dos@@ sh@@ rier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with ser@@ rated skin , but also in three dimensions , the original form of the animal is ret@@ ains &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the result is that the animal looks like today as it looks like in the early C@@ ret@@ ace@@ ous period .
you don &apos;t need a lot of imagination to re@@ construct it . if you only believe a little with the eyes of Sch@@ iel@@ i , you could believe almost believe that he is sleeping in the sleeping . &quot;
the chal@@ k time was a time when gigantic ther@@ op@@ ods , car@@ ni@@ vo@@ res din@@ osau@@ r , which stood on two legs , spread over the earth .
although the king of them , the ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex lived , millions years after Bo@@ re@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the paved din@@ osau@@ rs was exp@@ elled from some of his fur@@ y ancestors .
the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus is part of the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 feet ( 11.5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters .
the scientists , their latest findings in the journal Current Biology appear to believe that Bo@@ re@@ op@@ el@@ ta has sunk in the sea after the death of the sea and in mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk when he was on 21 March 2011 at Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alberta , Canada , green .
according to the museum , it is the covered din@@ osau@@ rs in the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the sn@@ out until th@@ igh .
the creatures had an average of approximately 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long peaks that were ra@@ ged by his shoul@@ ders .
the researchers believe that the paved plant stress has been w@@ asted by the western Canada until a floo@@ ded river was floo@@ ded into the open sea .
but the underwater circulation of the din@@ osau@@ rs keep its arm@@ or in exquisite detail detail .
the vest@@ ed remains of this special specimen are so good to keep the skin &apos;s still hol@@ ge plates along the din@@ osau@@ rs .
like Michael Gre@@ sh@@ ko for National Ge@@ ographic , it is such a level of preservation so as &apos; rarely like a win in lot@@ tery .
the more I see it , the more conf@@ using becomes .
use rem@@ n@@ ants of the skin still cover the hol@@ lows , which carry the skull of the beast .
his right front foot is on his side , his five fingers are donated to the top .
I can count the scales at his sole &apos; .
in the thunder@@ storm : mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on the A8 : many injured
severe accident on Thursday evening at the A8 : almost 30 vehicles have been involved in a mass deposit .
there are numerous compar@@ isons , kil@@ o @-@ long st@@ ems - and G@@ aff@@ er .
at the Stuttgart @-@ Munich motorway ( A8 ) , about 20 people have been injured in the late morning afternoon .
according to the first information of the police , at 17.00 hrs there were about 30 vehicles between the connection set no@@ zh@@ ausen and O@@ del@@ zh@@ ausen ( Landkreis A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm just under 30 vehicles , including trucks and trucks .
over the exact number of the last population did not exceed any data .
it action for mild to medium injuries , said a pol@@ ze@@ al pre@@ cher .
a large attach@@ ments to rescue vehicles was at the accident of the accident .
the A8 was completely locked in the direction of Munich .
in the direction of Munich , some ten kilometres long back@@ drop was formed .
like a AZ repor@@ ter , it also occurred on the counter @-@ road to massive disabilities - by numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire brig@@ ade not@@ ted the characteristics of the vehicle hand@@ leb@@ ars , which now have to be reck@@ oned with sensitive pen@@ alties .
shortly after 18 : 45 hrs there was another second accident on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ le@@ asing .
it was a coll@@ ision between a car transporter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident .
Deutsche Bahn : Group test@@ et &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot;
it &apos;s a moment that almost everyone has experienced : nothing is sitting in the train and sleeps .
or it is deep@@ ened in his work and has just a brilliant thoughts .
and then : buff@@ ered .
comes the workers , and wo@@ ke up a man or provoke the g@@ ast in the midst of the workflow .
tickets control .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are over soon .
the Germans are currently testing the portable driving card control .
it is just confirmed by phone , that one has taken its place and evalu@@ ates the ticket .
currently , a test run is running on two routes .
&quot; comes the offer , wide we expect it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is then expected to be available in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a train speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; calls the train to the driver evaluation without Schaff@@ ner .
in order to use the use , some requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to booked an online ticket - what would you have to do in most passengers .
it is also necessary to have purchased the DB navig@@ ator app , which is the most convenient type of ticket office .
and recently you need a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works : one gets into the train , calls his ticket under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the test customers the button appears to be an electronic distribution .
the train atten@@ dant to their mobile devices is a message that the g@@ ast X has taken in the train and has taken the booked seating area Y .
comes the train atten@@ dant to place Y , he knows that a passenger has already s@@ lit online ticket there .
one can therefore continue to sleep on , continue silent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the railway , which again should use the passengers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; those who want to travel without ticket control by our train stations , check in the DB Navigator .
this allows the passengers to transform your travel time in the train &apos;s personal travel , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing @-@ Management of DB Fern@@ Traffic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to enter to individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who often goes train , know that besides del@@ ays and missed turns the ticket orders to the biggest doctors .
because often , in any case , one of the trav@@ ellers don &apos;t have any documents involved in any case you need to re@@ use online tickets .
either the credit card or the identity card or otherwise a document that you must have .
the result are endless discussions between train atten@@ dant and driving g@@ ast , which leads to worse atmosphere in the part or greater space and del@@ ays in control of your own tickets and aff@@ ecting the workers at the end of time to take care of others .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and this is also only available on the 915 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
other access numbers on the same route are still un@@ locked .
how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 , Britt@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was sh@@ aken by its core .
just one day after they arrived in New York City , sitting in St. Louis Geb@@ or@@ ene on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment , which she rented and sc@@ roll through Facebook on her phone .
they proud of a mail from som@@ eb@@ ody from the High School .
&quot; the police have just killed an 18 year old child , and it still lies on the road , &quot; called it .
conf@@ using , since nobody had posted information on their feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Ph@@ aro@@ ah has been constantly prayed for their tim@@ eline .
the Rap@@ per from the territory of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white polic@@ emen in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , was killed , live .
he posted a picture of Brow@@ ns le@@ bl@@ os@@ em body , which was stretched out on the road and remain there for four hours .
&quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; I thought at Fer@@ rel@@ l .
but death was for them and their fellowship nothing new .
she put her mobile phone to returning later on the evening of Twe@@ ets on the Can@@ field Drive .
there were photos of the police band and people who had cried out , and from a man who claimed to be a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ ons Police has just killed my innocent son ! &quot;
they observed a live feed where a polic@@ eman stands in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bell@@ ished dog .
in another video , she said , failed another polic@@ eman and cried , saying , &quot; I will kill you ... animals all kill . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l remin@@ ded their statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder , which we are acc@@ ust@@ omed to us and we are typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at this moment I felt sc@@ ams .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
they booked a return flight and went home to the next day .
after landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she took her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two next morning would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on .
what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in the cinem@@ as from the 11 .
it is a history of the survi@@ vor@@ s and the protest , the strength and the power , the strength and the resistance , which consists of the perspective of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to ask answers .
when Fer@@ rel@@ l carried her daughter , a flower dress , and a matching crown , after F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two of them had a conversation , which they had numerous occasions in front of this morning &quot; on the black experience and the black condition . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember , as I have taught you when black people have to fight for they ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she remin@@ ded of what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we now go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , because the police killed an 18 year old boy , and that was not true .
I could not take it , &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l later .
&quot; what happens today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
she must know and see it and be removed in it .
it must be well developed , not only acti@@ vis@@ m and organization , but also know the various layers of the black experience and the black Constitution and what we must do to free to free ourselves .
even if I have the luck to give her an experience in which she does not have any ec@@ cl@@ onal rac@@ ism , it is not different than the next black women child .
I have the feeling I would have a bad service to keep it far . &quot;
the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the Police Department , which was waiting for a camp as the activists in the potential non @-@ indictment from Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there is Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter linked to a local business owner who made lunch .
they prepared bags before and hal@@ ve them on demonstr@@ ators .
slowly began a new type of acti@@ vis@@ m for Fer@@ rel@@ l &apos;s shape .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my acti@@ vis@@ m has changed after 9 August totally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said and noted that she was a student at the University of Missouri @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student N@@ Course Association , and focused on eating justice and health ine@@ qualities in black congregations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it &apos;s all come . &quot;
weeks later , Fer@@ rel@@ l met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an evening , one of the co @-@ directors of the film .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said , she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r wanted only &quot; document &quot; what happened .
a question came by Fer@@ rel@@ l in the meaning : &quot; would you document or try to find a story that you can use ? &quot;
this sk@@ ep@@ tic@@ ism was nur@@ tured by countless cases of people , often of white - in a community that benef@@ ited from their pain and resistance .
as fol@@ ay@@ an recently declared in an interview : &quot; we had heard that people who were born in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on and grew up , their voices were not cent@@ red , and we wanted to do it . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area that is known for its acti@@ vis@@ m around the death of death .
his commitment brought by Fer@@ rel@@ l the project together with six other nati@@ ves the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ns shooting .
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talking with us . we speak , &quot; said Davis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the main thing for me as these people are displayed , because I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was to focus on Fer@@ re@@ ll@@ s experience - to show that it is not a Messiah leader , but for a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be the obvious number of participants in the film .
what are the documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; sur@@ pris@@ ingly personal aspects of Fer@@ re@@ ll@@ s lives as she loves and mar@@ ries their wife .
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; she said Fer@@ rel@@ l and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that there must be certain vulner@@ ability during this work and the human of the black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Fer@@ re@@ ll@@ s history repe@@ ats the role of black pregnant women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves movement .
two of the three fo@@ unders of the movement that have influenced the film &quot; Black@@ liv@@ es@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in 2012 , identi@@ fies the film &quot; Black@@ liv@@ es@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in the social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , pregnant women in man@@ ag@@ erial positions took the movement altogether , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and therefore we fight at different fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
black , pregnant women have to bear the main load of everything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an voted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement really is held by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it insi@@ sted that &quot; this is not an innovative type of action , &quot; at the Fer@@ rel@@ l has been selected as hearts of the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was the person who contra@@ sted these energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is no co@@ incidence , although it was in front of the front , because with a life on those clo@@ aks as a black , pregnant woman is as much on the game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can feel the energy through the screen . &quot;
meanwhile , the news @-@ cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long disappeared , but the ra@@ iny connections between the community and the police continue to stand .
Fer@@ rel@@ l is on prob@@ ation for 2 ½ years due to the blocking of a highway with a demonstration .
she describes the social atmosphere of the area that she calls their home : &quot; a chaos . &quot;
however , she kl@@ ed on a voc@@ als and she feels the memory of this memorial since she went three years ago in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on .
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we need to love one another and support .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; up to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; size &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : TV @-@ reader discuss a bit gallery
the bit Gallery moves the human being , even though it is not yet built .
but the idea of a shopping centre at the south @-@ end of the pedestrian zone has been ob@@ sol@@ ete since the first presentation in 2009 , the population in Be@@ aches and opponents .
the topic hardly leaves the theme .
the theme will also be discussed on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg . &quot;
while the one to the bit Gallery say : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; This would be real class &quot; ( Nicole Becker ) , comes from the other side : &quot; needs no man &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ eds ) or completely : &quot; size w@@ ahn ! &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) .
while the fears build that a gallery contains more customers in the city , they also benefit from the other business , fear the ad@@ versaries , that the pedestrian zone would be bl@@ ut@@ tered .
in addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the plot in which the pe@@ asant market hall is available , in the 13 directors are mark@@ eted their products .
the construction work will be completed by the end of the construction .
the Gallery M@@ acher want to integrate a market hall in the new building - namely to the Bed@@ a square with possibility to sit without sitting outside .
Simone Room : &quot; we &apos;ve been buying back almost weekly in the pe@@ asant market for many years .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cake of the women are still very happy .
we also have discovered the but@@ cher for us .
we would wish that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also .
especially the Klein@@ mark@@ thalle in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct market in a market hall in the gallery comes to the amount of rent .
the new project is likely not to be low in the new project . &quot;
Eva Kil@@ ic : &quot; what &apos;s shopping in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , shoes , drug or supermarkets : I find the super@@ flu@@ ous .
there are already enough in our city .
you can see how many shop transactions are empty here - some for months and years .
but there is not even a regular weekly market here , it is so important that at least it remains the market hall .
for all the goods offered there is fresh , mainly directly from the producer , and is offered at low cost .
as you can see , shop transactions in a shopping centre is rented only from larger firms , because the rental rentals are often not portable for one retail@@ er .
too bad , special transactions , there are almost no more and what is still left , will probably disappear . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping mall with a market hall is not suitable for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
above all , where is the pe@@ asant market hall during the construction time ?
the old E@@ DE@@ KA would be the solution - even in duration when the bit Gallery comes in fact .
or does it manages to drive the bit of bit to drive all businesses from Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; that &apos;s just not work .
and shopping center , which stands empty , does not need any one .
my view after it would have been better to promote a real farm market instead of this gallery .
but for a pe@@ asant hall , it is also possible thanks to the mad@@ ly many - as I find - sen@@ sel@@ ess building projects in Bit@@ burg no place anymore .
when the pe@@ asant market hall is made , a piece of culture will disappear . &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits of Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
in the middle of the room of Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces are visible - white , black and brown which are almost invisible - which hang on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits have been created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ lights and hair@@ s , which were sent by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the ex@@ cer@@ pts from the prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former secret service analy@@ tics obtained a 35 @-@ year prison sentence after she made public diplomatic news about the site of Wik@@ i .
the new exhibition , which opened on 2 August , is called A Bec@@ oming Res@@ em@@ bl@@ ance ( A matching simil@@ arity ) .
it is the product of two years Cor@@ respon@@ dence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , their discipl@@ ines in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a Trans@@ ition and ground@@ breaking dis@@ sid@@ y , whose condem@@ nation was converted by Barack Obama , when he had only three days in his office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg created by the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA , which was created by Mann@@ ing , and out of the 30 portraits of DNA - the many wise men can be interpreted and the tough@@ est determin@@ ations of these interpre@@ tations - but also for identity .
Mann@@ ing , which was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but has been talking about the identification as a woman , was convicted in 2013 because of 20 charges , including six viol@@ ets against the sp@@ y law , computer and theft .
by the prison its picture was supp@@ ressed , so much that it was only one photo - a gra@@ ined , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in the man@@ ing is definitely sitting on a seat and a plat@@ in bl@@ onde is wearing - it was associated with them .
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg arrived from the great success of their 2012 @-@ Project &apos;@@ Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions . &quot;
in this , the artist produced portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts such as cigarette bl@@ unt and chew@@ ing g@@ um by extracted the DNA from the waste , to produce a picture of it , like those people could look like .
that was the time that she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they led an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; stated De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press review of the new exhibition .
and she couldn &apos;t visit at that time and she couldn &apos;t be photograph@@ ed , therefore they took contact with Chelsea and asked them whether they wanted a DNA portrait .
the artist and their in@@ car@@ ded m@@ use were taken to un@@ disp@@ oss@@ ed Bri@@ cks who ruled several letters over the course of two years .
they even known one of Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o illustrated com@@ ic &quot; Supp@@ liers Images , &quot; which would convert a future , in which the President Chel@@ y@@ righ@@ tly would be able to see the exhibition personally .
that Obama actually had just a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing release after seven gross years in a military prison was a welcome kind of happ@@ ier meeting .
there is also now at the opening of the exhibition a little depth and Star@@ kes , da Donald Tr@@ ump leads an war against in@@ forman@@ t from the government camps and against Trans@@ gender forces to find new , twe@@ et@@ able paths to prevent the rigid sphere which he actually is to escape .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked after the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen in a certain reason . &quot;
in one on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing called Mann@@ ing with its super@@ se@@ ful signature ( that &quot; i &quot; in her family name is equipped with a heart ) an end of the &quot; automatic tre@@ ats , whose foundation gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture have been . &quot;
on the opposite wall , its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thousands of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hop@@ ed , through the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nu@@ cle@@ ot@@ ide according to the highly developed scientific enc@@ y@@ clo@@ pe@@ dia of the artist ) , like aston@@ ishing , at least in biological terms , we all are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what people are hop@@ efully use that our gen@@ ome will not take care of , who we are and how open genetic data for a interpretation and how sub@@ jective them are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video artwork from 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous memories , will also be seen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , hence the 30 of these stories are .
the last piece in the exhibition that is kept in an own room is a side from the mentioned Com@@ ic @-@ Nov@@ elle .
it shows Mann@@ ing how they diving with a free hands @-@ free fall from the discipl@@ ines of the United States as King @-@ Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they ch@@ ill your words , then they have won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; so is never the mouth . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter which she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist that gre@@ et out of Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I still get tired when I speak about it . &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition yet - as it was predicted in the com@@ ic book - but if they should do it , then it will be greeted in the middle of the room by their own gen@@ om@@ ic simulation , which are summarized as hor@@ den of Protest@@ ants .
that was also targeted as everything in the exhibition until the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ings St@@ ature ) , where their genetic ti@@ met@@ ering were written with a pencil .
&quot; in the past , I had it on the wall , but I wanted to feel like a crowd , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg by the portraits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted to feel like a mass movement that broke themselves with Chelsea , just as the movement that goes behind their liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor of the University of North@@ western and an employee of the University of Oxford for murder
a nationwide man @-@ hunt for a professor at North@@ western University and a staff of the university of Oxford which was looking for susp@@ ects , after a man had been killed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with dead@@ ly injuries .
on the Monday for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham L@@ ath@@ em ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warran@@ ts for murder of her alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ emp@@ au , like the Ak@@ ers of the official court of Cook County .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , after several engra@@ ver died .
a shared warning system was published by the Chicago Department of Foreign Affairs , that the Lei@@ che was discovered on July 27th .
officials received a call , came to Grand Plaza Apartments and found victims with several injuries in his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared on the site of the event for dead , and Det@@ ectives investig@@ ates the bul@@ che as murder while the police actively seeks to susp@@ ect the two susp@@ ects .
L@@ ath@@ em has been Professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at North@@ western University since 2007 .
Alan K. Cub@@ bage , Vice @-@ President for college relations , said in an e @-@ mail declaration that L@@ ath@@ em was now in be@@ ur@@ ks , and from entering the campus of North@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a criminal issue which exam@@ ines by the competent authorities , and the North@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cub@@ bage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford .
a spokes@@ man of the University and the Som@@ erville College said in an e @-@ mail declaration that &quot; we are in contact with the police in Great Britain in contact and ready to help the U.S. investig@@ ative authorities in any way . &quot;
the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens colleagues sho@@ cked and wanted to be that he turned himself .
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Office of Chicago , Anthony Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi , said he challenge the susp@@ ects to make a susp@@ ect to the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police has a presentation of her dwelling place , and our efforts to loc@@ alize them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects .
Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said , the police received a call from the building of the Grand @-@ Plaza building that has just received a lau@@ ght tip that had just happened in apartment 1008 .
the police described the scene as very fierce .
Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said it is clear whether the incident happened on July 27th .
it was confirmed by security cameras that L@@ ath@@ em and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victims had a relationship , &quot; said Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi .
the Management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation about the residents : &quot; the police is currently working on the tim@@ eline and the background of the sacrifice and sear@@ ches a variety of moti@@ fs , including a possible domestic approach . &quot;
&quot; we will conclu@@ de the WA@@ DA schedule in the near future &quot; - Russian Vi@@ zep@@ re@@ mi@@ er Mut@@ ko
Russian Vi@@ zep@@ re@@ mi@@ er Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said it will not take long until the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; in a certain stage of the criteria of the schedule , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in collaboration with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) .
the WA@@ DA schem@@ atics has been updated in this regard , &quot; explained Mut@@ ko on Thursday .
the PM commented on the second part of the schedule of the WA@@ DA in compliance with the code , which describes the criteria for re@@ integration of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the website of the organization .
according to Mut@@ ko , he doesn &apos;t contain any thing that could give the reason for Russia .
&quot; everything was announced , everything is implemented .
and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and the WA@@ DA in the near future . &quot; he added .
one of the criteria mentioned above criteria , however , states that the Russian anti @-@ D@@ oping authorities approved the reported results of the WA@@ DA by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren to alleged nation@@ ally sponsored D@@ op@@ ings in Russian sport .
in relation to the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; we lead the investigation into our anti @-@ d@@ oping system .
all measures have been implemented .
but there was no state programs , and we will not release any thing that doesn &apos;t exist . &quot;
Mut@@ c@@ os &apos;s words agreed with those of Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v , the head of the independent Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping Commission .
in conversation with the Russian sales office R@@ sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v gave problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping organisations , but then added : &quot; we said to repeat that the report has controversi@@ al positions and regulations .
no one has to accept this report un@@ conditional , &quot; Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v added .
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded in November 2015 as part of the D@@ oping Sk@@ and@@ als from the WA@@ DA by the implementation of D@@ oping control in Russia .
however , you were allowed to plan and coordin@@ ate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK anti @-@ D@@ oping ( U@@ K@@ AD ) .
following a visit to the main quarters of the Organisation in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA @-@ Director Olivier Niger explained that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA is moving into the right direction &quot; moves to be used again .
Al@@ di sells no eggs more
they divided the corporate groups .
it is handy for a pure precau@@ tion that could not be assumed for any health impair@@ ment , it was said in the Noti@@ fication .
from now on , only eggs are delivered to Al@@ di , which have been proven to be tested negative at fi@@ as@@ ive anti @-@ lung cancer .
Al@@ di may produce clarity and transparency to his customers .
the Start @-@ ups that can help your company will not be to the next U@@ ber
A@@ my deliver@@ t wanted to measure the happiness at your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but did not work .
answers were often v@@ ague , little helpful or - even worse - fr@@ au@@ dul@@ ent .
and even when she promised An@@ onym@@ ity , some workers didn &apos;t do the process .
&quot; there never has never been consistency and lens , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t who operates the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care company Madison Re@@ ed .
it has people from outside to help .
a new race of human resources start @-@ ups is on wax to help companies find out how their employees feel .
through the creation and licens@@ ing of software that has the specific purpose of the measurement of employees , it allows companies to organize , speci@@ fying groups and demo@@ graphic groups , and in some cases W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ n permit to apply the C @-@ suite exec@@ u@@ tives and to apply directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; you are now tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for the persecution of their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your business ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analy@@ zer is used by companies to measure employee commitment .
Er@@ ret@@ t said that she has a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t .
in addition to the Sn@@ ap surveys and surveys from certain teams , it offers a heat map of the company that shows the majority of most complaints and what managers have low condition results - so you can re@@ boot why .
companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture , you will not have to stay at the top of the workplace , which has been published in Sk@@ and@@ als , since then a former employee describes a blog post which describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ess@@ ments , with those who have spoken , pen@@ alised .
for start @-@ ups like G@@ lin@@ t , this wish for an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business possibility .
the global govern@@ ance , regulation and compliance checks could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion , according to the financial technical website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments .
Denver , Colorado , start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps prevent evil behavior and to detect , saw an increasing interest and activity beginning of this year in the middle of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ all in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
Conver@@ cent has almost 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tesla .
u@@ ber has recently signed as a client .
how G@@ lin@@ t , Conver@@ cent Business Custom@@ ized &quot; Pow@@ der &quot; will send confi@@ denti@@ ality to view confi@@ dential responses in real time and watch the heat maps of your problem .
it also offers an anonymous SMS hotline , with which employees can report bad behavior .
and if the main managing director is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; the Court of Public Opinion has captured the Reg@@ ul@@ ators , &quot; says Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Conver@@ cent .
if a company is found that his staff is po@@ or@@ ly treated or in@@ eth@@ ical , it can experience precious consequences by consumers @-@ boy@@ cott , employee fluctu@@ ation and complaints , said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations , has Conver@@ cent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures , and have a simple way to achieve their corporate headquarters .
previously , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he had to submit or send a telephone number or e @-@ mail to the company &apos;s headquarters , a formal complaint and hope that he was seriously .
it was often a duty and un@@ comfortable experience , James Vit@@ rano , Ruby TU@@ ES@@ DA@@ Y@@ S General Coun@@ sel , who said there was no good opportunity to track the complaints of employees .
well , since the Conver@@ cent Conver@@ cent puts problems , the previously mentioned by exec@@ u@@ tives who were in offices in cities or countries , were hidden - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or no more practitioners .
&quot; I can be closer to this holi@@ stic , 360 @-@ degree view over the experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who heads the risk management Group of Ruby Tuesday .
&quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment laws . &quot;
companies began to take Eth@@ ics , Values and Emplo@@ ye@@ es in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed because of the En@@ ron @-@ Sk@@ and@@ al by En@@ ron @-@ Sk@@ and@@ al , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social Media &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came to their right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that they knew not that you could not prevent their dirty clothes online . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before using technology to monitor the eth@@ ics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ cent offer your software as service , and do the company with recur@@ ring fees for use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance to find the approval of Venture Capital investors , which supports both start @-@ ups .
Conver@@ cent received $ 10 million in financing in February of companies such as Sapphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , where the total capital was raised to $ 47 million .
gl@@ itter@@ ing secured $ 10 million in November of Bess@@ emer Venture Partners and brought the whole financing to $ 60 million .
these investment is hardly surprising , in view of a connected nature of businesses , culture and Venture Capital .
there is a growing complex in research that shows that the employees from their jobs more than before .
there are high sal@@ aries and interesting projects in competitive markets such as Sil@@ icon Valley .
the employees want to have the feeling that you are accepted and appreciated that you will give your time a company with a positive mission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if people are glad to be happy to make their voices , and that the work that you are doing , then they will feel stronger , and they will feel stronger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and Sp@@ ye@@ e Experience in Link@@ ed@@ In , which is both Conver@@ cent as well as G@@ lin@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot;
investors can reach R@@ end@@ ites when their portfolio company run well . companies run well when employees are working and involved .
if the Analytics Tools uses third parties to increase commitment and use of employees , it is no wonder that you will find assistance .
the data on employees work is important according to experts of the workplace culture .
but the data are us@@ eless if the administrator of a company does not take action .
in fact , if a company asks employees according to your feedback , it may have a anticip@@ ation that the change is on the way .
and if the change is not fast enough , or at all , this dis@@ appoint@@ ments and employees can be dem@@ oti@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you ask for 4.000 suggestions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the business management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen the company to have left the collection of data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you do not follow the workers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you take care of yourself ?
and who doesn &apos;t take care of this , why should I ? &quot;
Madison Re@@ ed , which is now monthly employee trans@@ missions , was able to initi@@ ate measures on the same day if a problem is reported on G@@ lin@@ t , so er@@ ret@@ t .
and after collecting feedback from fru@@ str@@ ated employees it was able to re@@ organise multiple teams within the company and to add multiple teams within the company and to add a communication training to tackle the problems .
with Ruby Tuesday , the company will always receive new in@@ sights about the staff , and it hopes that in a long sight , this leads to a better binding of workers in a sector which is known for high income .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose human beings , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and if you lose people , you lose our customers .
and if you lose customer , you will lose the company .
N@@ CAA remov@@ es two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the fra@@ ins
it goes on 23 : 00 when a lot of U@@ CL@@ A footprint on one side of the new exercise fields of the team are talking on campus .
some have pulled down their tri@@ c@@ ops and show the back full of swe@@ at from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team represent these un@@ ten minutes lunch break .
players who are enrolled at the summer courses are returning to their aud@@ iting exercise , before they return to the Water Football Center in the next morning at 6 : 30 am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is for the guys the next three days a real t@@ ret@@ mill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a short before Monday to Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CAA elim@@ in@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the burden of players , and it has actually extended its days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore the first three training sessions of the U@@ CL@@ A should start at 7 : 15 a.m. to meet the already packed tim@@ ings of the players .
the compromise between the two days is more than one day , which the brood joins the start of Camps almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six playing times in West@@ wood practical exercises .
they should hold 18 exercises during the course of August . 20 before the beginning of the formal fair preparations for their kick @-@ off against Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he under@@ line the rules of the N@@ CAA itself , even if they add the complex routes of the players a further point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous load three or four days on it , and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and they simply pushed it down , they pl@@ ets down , they are great people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think once we come up to Saturday and we will have more time , it will really great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U@@ CL@@ A will termin@@ ate their practices as soon as the camp is terminated , which was rejected in view of the clear visual lines of its fields from a adjacent car park and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the highlighted class , which had already been w@@ asted with foot@@ balls , which will be a slight task .
Bru@@ ins players will occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a dre@@ amed that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem , and it &apos;s not far back to think that people rent a room there and then set it to draw a practice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the video and have a exercise , it is quite good business .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best , with what we have .
so I &apos;m not wor@@ ried to worry about this .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit messages
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with folding messages from third parties and their results under the original contribution , the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called f@@ ake news .
the company said in a opinion on his site that it will begin with the use of updated mechanical learning methods to recogn@@ ise possible folder messages , which may display the results of the quoted test results from the original article .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the major distribution points for so @-@ called f@@ ake news , many of which believe that they have also affected the US presidential election in 2016 .
the problem is also become a major political theme in Europe , whereby the French voters were floo@@ ded in May with false stories , and Germany will support a plan that succe@@ eds social media networks , if it didn &apos;t succeed to eliminate hot water @-@ filled post@@ ings as before the elections there in September .
on Thursday , Facebook in a separate explanation on German , in the United States , France , the Netherlands and Germany , a test of the new facts review will be launched .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides the knowledge , which stories of fact exam@@ ining third parties , people want more context to make sure they read and share , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sara Su , product man@@ ag@@ ator for Facebook messages in a blog . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she added that Facebook will continue to be able to test this feature in conjunction with the article &quot; in conjunction with other changes to its news feed , to reduce wrong messages .
create a Com@@ ic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his younger past , the small Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squ@@ e@@ eze music video and was for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ he and 1980 @-@ he was a sle@@ eper .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of tur@@ bul@@ ent history of his cozy seat in the wat@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a mop@@ ha@@ zi Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a pre@@ ference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I find it so nice to look at the hand of someone who is dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . every story was illustrated by another , coming British artist - Isaac Lenk@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des that was based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection which was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project which he was unexpected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only re@@ acts on the thum@@ b @-@ print on the side of a letter which was written for the 1700 @-@ s , who worked for the Jac@@ o@@ bin@@ s &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is his thum@@ b impression ! &quot;
and letters always smell after smoke , because at that time there was fire because of light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has a effect as it would be even though .
Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is sm@@ itten with old pap@@ ules , it is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England , and almost four months in a castle was living ( &quot; To be hon@@ est : I have got my welcome mine &quot; ) seems to be true to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days to explore the Vict@@ orian &quot; Castle to explore the archives and the many treasures and cur@@ ios@@ ities of the castle , such as the mon@@ ed Hy@@ ra@@ ps on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the grave .
he emigrated through the grounds and ruins of the old castle , and spoke with land @-@ makers , mer@@ chandise and sometimes also with the artists who worked at the illustrations of his book .
then , at night he drank of &quot; whis@@ key and began to write . &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust received the full access in 2006 when the last I am , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey died .
when Rho@@ des arrived one decade later , the employees began to take care of the archive , which he said as &quot; hundreds of years , in which Arist@@ ro@@ rates said &quot; Oh , cast it on the attic . &quot;
diary , letters from the time of the English Em@@ pi@@ res , maps showing what possessed : &quot; it could mean that land conflict would be bor@@ ing , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to fight two families .
guys , let &apos;s go all his ais@@ le ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to spread on bro@@ ader base in the English history , among them &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which leaves the newly built castle in order to join the farmhouse of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record of a ri@@ ot that occurred in 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book with the title &apos; Kn@@ igh@@ tly Famil@@ ies of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; says Rho@@ des .
&quot; the pe@@ asant movement began in this area and I thought , an uprising was a good start .
perhaps the two are connected together ? &quot;
other stories are firmly ro@@ oted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; that tells the story of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ rons , who lay the history of Dar@@ rel@@ l seven years during the British Reformation .
or &apos; The Sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers &apos; in which the sm@@ ug@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l is depicted in the 18th century , who filled his own fun@@ eral , being filled a sar@@ g with stones ( a discovery , which was only dug only years later ) .
the Dar@@ re@@ ll@@ s are Rho@@ des &apos;s favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gent@@ l@@ emen is appropriate to be able to make debts and spend money for things that they could not aff@@ ord .
other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l @-@ men swe@@ ets their debt crisis by giving rich old women , I present them as a he@@ ap @-@ looking guys , with a talent to advertise the land@@ locked . &quot;
after the end of his use in the castle Rho@@ des in search of other unique write experiences
he has brought a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a com@@ ic novel about Als@@ ati@@ m@@ ä@@ ki in the early 20th century , which has been re@@ claimed by nature since then .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; says he .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ah , now I have to get ready with the dam@@ ning life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign started : over 300 years old Mari@@ c@@ rats covered in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the inv@@ alid of the 301 @-@ year old Mari@@ et@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f started on Friday their campaign to launch a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau of Thursday ) .
until Thursday , Mayor Otto N@@ EU@@ HO@@ FF and his marketing team will keep the logo and the slogan .
at the end of August , it will be a highlight of the campaign on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; too nice for us .
or ? , &quot; ask the makers of action since yesterday on the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer Chapel .
&quot; we think this ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; write them on their yesterday registered website .
&quot; but we use this measure to win your attention .
and to make clear that lack is better than it seems .
basically , we are the firm that we are as bad Hon@@ ne@@ cks citizens to know the beauty and attrac@@ tiv@@ eness of our city very well . &quot;
in the action there is more than &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it continues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true to form@@ ulate a stand@@ alone promise that gives the city an un@@ mist@@ ak@@ able unique feature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally , they stand in the contest with other municipalities .
a medium @-@ digit amount allows the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f will cost their new umbrella brand and the campaign .
military re@@ forms in Turkey - Erd@@ og@@ an An@@ xi@@ ety before the Army
each year at the beginning of August in Ankara , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ as ) lies on pension funds and exploitation in officer .
so this week also .
at first sight a normal process .
but nothing is routine for the Turkish forces a year after the coup attempt .
the session no longer took place in the building of the General Staff , as previously , but in the office seat of the Prime Minister .
under the presi@@ dency of the government , ch@@ aired by the leaders , including the ministers for Defence , the Interior , Justice and Foreign Affairs .
this was the number of civilians in the Y@@ as in the number .
the government attrac@@ ts the government in the military .
Chief of Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in the position , but the commander of the host , Air Force and the Navy .
since the failed coup , Staat@@ chy has fired 169 of 326 gener@@ als and ad@@ mir@@ als since the failed coup .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to con@@ genital connections for the Movement of Ex@@ ile Pre@@ dig@@ ers Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , the Erd@@ og@@ an as an inter@@ locking of the sli@@ pper .
around 486 people , which should have been involved in the coup attempt , will have been involved in Ankara since this week .
already on the day after the coup attempt , Erd@@ og@@ an refers to the overthrow of the Lord &apos;s present , as he would give him the opportunity to clean the armed forces . &quot;
but did Erd@@ og@@ an the army really in handle ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article with the heading &quot; Un@@ certainty &quot; in the military headquarters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the general Staff , there is a concern about an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ist &quot; of the army which mani@@ f@@ ests itself among others in the repe@@ al of the head of soldiers , wrote the newspaper .
the big puri@@ fication in the army and the security forces will go on any further .
in mid @-@ July , Erd@@ og@@ an &apos;s decree issued another 73@@ 95 Heads of State , among them 230@@ 3 police officers and 546 soldiers .
it seemed to be the military . it seemed to be the military .
gener@@ als earlier than the real lor@@ ds of the country .
three times p@@ aired by calling on her role as gu@@ ardi@@ ans of the world@@ ly state of State .
following his election victory in 2002 , Erd@@ og@@ an ur@@ ged the power of the military step by step , not least under appeal to the reform of the European Union .
former officers say , Erd@@ og@@ an are targeted specifically an Islam@@ isation of forces .
in the magazine &quot; Voc@@ al Europe , &quot; a well @-@ called officer , who sought after the coup attempt from persecution in persecution of persecution , the Turkish army would be in a few years &quot; full of extreme extrem@@ ists and sal@@ af@@ ists . &quot;
it strikes that NATO could not be cold so cold .
in this alliance , there are doub@@ ts in the alliance for the acidity of the Turkish army .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the guide structures and operations are weak@@ ened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nato diplom@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington change the rules for the Green Card
there will be a new U.S. immig@@ ration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , President Donald Tr@@ ump , quoted from the media .
he sees to lower the legal immig@@ rants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter requirements for a temporary work permit and limitations for families @-@ oriented Visa .
the new rules are proposed by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , save wages and billion dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers , and will do this by the United States to get the way to the citizens from other countries Green Cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Act shall prevent chains migration and replace the current system .
this new application procedure will come to the candidate , the English speaking , which have the financial resources to support themselves and knowledge that we will benefit from the economy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted from the American media .
Ministry wants to maintain track for racing transportation
again , in the past months , over the future of the race of the race , it is now to go quickly .
before the end of the year , the main railway station is to be built on the tourist railway station .
in order to safegu@@ ard the future of the race track @-@ long term , according to information provided by the German Ministry of Transport , construction work will begin in this year .
&quot; with the decision to continue to order and hold the route Ilmenau @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country knows mainly for tourism important connection , &quot; explained by the state Secretary General Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Erfurt .
the costs for the repair of the route he increased to about 2.5 million euros .
this sum will take 75 percent of this sum .
the contract , on whose basis the shuttle is to be ordered in the future of the country , will currently be voted defin@@ ing , declared S@@ üh@@ l .
the Ministry and the Southern Rail@@ ways are already visible over the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are the road@@ map that tra@@ ded vehicles and quality standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
this means that the race @-@ platform shuttle should be re@@ ordered on December 2017 .
the racing bike shuttle is one of the most popular railway connection between the railway stations of Ilmenau and Renn@@ sti@@ g .
in the past few months , in the course of a pilot company , the distance of enough many people have been used to order them again in the future .
the route is also largely di@@ lap@@ id@@ ated in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real , and we should be wor@@ ried about
just as you thought that in 2017 there can &apos;t be a mad , a new report on technological developments in the area of sex robots .
yes , indeed .
sex robots are currently a big thing .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ) ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , emer@@ itus , professor of rob@@ ot@@ ics and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we have to start their way up .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pp@@ le and type of fing@@ ern@@ a@@ gel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people do funny about her , but the company deliver any amount of it , and we will still get much more common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Shar@@ key with the release of his new report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with deliber@@ ately human reaction that can be achieved by artificial intelligence .
the user can also custom@@ ize his robot according to its belie@@ fs &quot; and do everything to select from the eye color of the robot via the form of breast canc@@ ers to type or the color of his fing@@ ern@@ ails .
but there will be still in@@ qui@@ eter , as many robots have the &quot; personal@@ ities , &quot; which would look like a step@@ ford woman progressive .
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have developed to robots with a silicone skin .
the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot allows for example its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they are appe@@ aling like rel@@ ap@@ ses .
and then there is still the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold Sex robot developed by true personal@@ ities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which gives the impression of rel@@ ap@@ ses and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with a &quot; advent@@ u@@ rous &quot; personality .
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality who has been adapted to your personality as well as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the website of True Compan@@ ion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so you like what you like , and it doesn &apos;t like what you do not like , etc .
she has also got their mood during the day - quite as real people !
they can be tired , fixed on account or it can be &quot; in mood &quot; ! &quot;
there are many trou@@ bl@@ esome aspects in that rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the under@@ gone female characteristics that goes on ra@@ gi@@ d ( called here : resi@@ den@@ sely ) Far@@ rah is in@@ tran@@ qui@@ l one most .
on his website , True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) have a vibr@@ ator , why can males then have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; says it on the website .
however , these sex robots not only need a fet@@ ish or just a different sex@@ es .
their emergence and increasing refin@@ ement show a slightly dar@@ ker and deep@@ ening in our culture , to retreat from the Ideal of Gender equality , to a wish of sex with sub@@ jug@@ ation as optional .
most men , of course , no sex robots keep , and while FR@@ R re@@ members their rising popularity , however , they remain a preliminary on the edge of the consumer culture .
but what went out of the border areas , in regards to the spirit of time , in which we live , very instru@@ ctive .
and many people are not strange or bel@@ ong@@ ated until they have the free market for permission .
there is a certain rem@@ over that these high @-@ developed sex robots in a period appear in which the rights of women worldwide are threatened globally , in which the White House has given a president that h@@ ack@@ ed to have women .
the most horri@@ ble aspect of the television series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the ma@@ id@@ servant &apos; ) are not the graphic images that acts ir@@ rig@@ orous body and the out@@ bound eyes , but how realistic these vision .
the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it feels like a big jump .
the goal behind these sex robots , there is a physical simil@@ arity to real women as realistic as technically possible ( if also with por@@ no@@ star propor@@ tions ) .
their car@@ ic@@ kers want to feel human being that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
but , to the point , if it goes around their &quot; personal@@ ities , &quot; the robot do not represent a real women .
they can not separate or go away from their companions .
they don &apos;t have a placement or background history , nothing that could be in@@ depen@@ dency or anything that could distur@@ b the imagination of total failure .
unlike different : they are counter@@ f@@ ancy slaves .
or to express it in the expres@@ sions of 2017 :
tr@@ um@@ ps great power ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney to the In@@ struction of the healthy human being
it has become a B@@ ins@@ en@@ co@@ ish@@ eit of the Tr@@ ump era that the political divisions that have polarized the U.S. voters , even families in small format .
around Christmas and harvest , there were in the USA newspapers with advice about how to select the hor@@ ror from tr@@ ump .
we ad@@ ore to us all supp@@ os@@ edly in order to burst our filter bub@@ bles .
less not@@ e@@ emed is the power of Tr@@ um@@ ps , Famil@@ ies to accommodate families .
I chose this because my c@@ ousin , a left @-@ directional di@@ chter@@ in who lives in Chicago and has long been involved with the Republi@@ can in our family , who visited me this week in New York .
they remin@@ ded me that the unit may have a mighty effect against any common enemy .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone who knows it , including the republi@@ can transformation , with whom she had fought for decades because of politics suddenly and completely independent on the same side .
in order to find the dining table it is certainly a good thing , but it falls in a further context that this also brings significant risks .
the left hand was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the greater impact of his presi@@ dency has the power to push us all to the right .
when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and Tr@@ ump , we refer to the gr@@ us@@ el@@ ige option that we will not encounter his k@@ itt@@ ens of a day anymore .
however , there is a terri@@ fying long @-@ time scenario , in the Tr@@ ump Rep@@ ublic@@ ans of the right wing &quot; norm@@ alizes &quot; which appeared in comparison to his standards suddenly as an in@@ ep@@ it@@ eness of failure .
I found myself from an active nost@@ al@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s Com@@ preh@@ ensive version of the betra@@ y@@ ach , the 14 % income tax ( but at least , we knew how his tax declaration saw ) - both in comparison to Tr@@ ump in fact a very mild criminal off@@ ences .
when Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans must only be spiritu@@ ally healthy to qualify as an indisp@@ ens@@ able improvement .
when my c@@ ousin in the city was , we brought our children to Car@@ ou@@ sel in Central Park , the biggest of the car &apos;s car park , and the best three dollars that one can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need caffeine .
the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are cris@@ py and the animals are turned to look full of their own shoul@@ ders - extremely fin@@ ster and the lim@@ estone music convey@@ s this on a remarkable way .
as many cl@@ auses of a city , the views of high buildings are become old , the Sky@@ lines are familiar to provide a lot of exc@@ itement , and the reality of the city will not be justified .
five @-@ five years later , and I am not yet gone over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss Cottage - the themes Pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage does not count , but a great roundabout in the north of London .
but the Central Park Car@@ ou@@ sel is still a strange magical experience since two two @-@ year @-@ old , an 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ year @-@ old , and all have a great time .
if I had to evaluate the car@@ ou@@ sel , I would have given to him the full score , but fortunately no one asked after that .
on the other hand , I was forced to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I was able to pass through my credit card .
in coffee at the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to purchase an average of 15 % tip - this to buy something about the shop .
this does not only result in a slow@@ down of what is actually a neutral replacement should be , but pract@@ ising pressure on the server to bring personality to a situation where no required is required .
the poor woman in the department store stood exc@@ itement , while I tired the experience , your credit card with five stars would be enough .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us with chest pain from the prison to hospital
for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital visit .
last year he was transferred to the hospital for the treatment of Schn@@ itten , which he suffered the prison authorities according to a case in his cell .
Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to murder of the prosec@@ uting attor@@ neys for murder of the prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
he killed steak in the early morning hours of Valentine &apos;s early morning by offering them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ t@@ oria on it .
Pist@@ ori@@ us maintained that he held his gir@@ l@@ friend for a night penetration , who was hidden in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors announced their intention , this time against the six @-@ year prison sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , from which they say is to op@@ aque .
the National Prosec@@ ution Department said that they will lift up the appeal against the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the obj@@ ection could be heard this year .
Pist@@ ori@@ us is risk that his penalty will be increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as a farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the four @-@ cl@@ amps made from f@@ ers and ov@@ ens were released into the holidays and on the secondary schools .
three of the students go to school in future , four at the secondary school .
school teacher Angel@@ ika S@@ itte greeted the parents and representatives of the public in the Bi@@ es@@ ental Civil House in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen .
as a symbol of the school release , 29 students of four classes elected under the direction of Sophia Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der a young eagle that grows in the chicken , but then put into freedom .
in this way , the m@@ tr@@ il@@ ar led a musical with the title &quot; Der Eagle in the poultry farm . &quot;
farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and made it extinct from his chick@@ ens .
instead of a chicken , there came a little eagle .
but the hope of him to make a chicken , cr@@ ushed out , the eagle spread out its wings on a high mountain on a high mountain .
after that , the classes showed three and four in the study of Y@@ v@@ onne Frank a chicken dance .
the h@@ ens dance with the young Go@@ ck@@ les , the cylinder contributed to the bet .
the eagle stand for integration , said school leader Angel@@ ika S@@ itte .
although the young is different than the other young ( ch@@ icks ) , but they are .
but he will never be like a chicken .
his determination is to be free .
they wanted to show every quarter of a quarter that he feels to be accepted in his new school .
this was followed by grat@@ itude to the col@@ oration , the former school leader Michael Müller , who jumps back again in school eng@@ es , and the parents represented .
the Kü@@ ken@@ ess is over now , explained class@@ room Sophia Schumacher .
they leave their students after two years of lessons only very un@@ married , because it was a really great time .
finally , you can rely on the square ir@@ rig@@ ation .
to conclu@@ de all students a song from summer time and vacation period .
it broke great joy in the children .
eight first applic@@ ators have already registered for the new school year .

software update for diesel vehicles : what do you need to know now
how accurate is the software update ?
do diesel drivers need to participate in action ?
the most important questions and answers on an overview .
in the diesel @-@ summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW @-@ Group software updates for a total of approximately 5.3 million cars are offered .
they should improve exhaust emissions of cars of Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 emissions .
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are excluded .
Anja S@@ met@@ anin vom ACE Auto Club Europe are estim@@ ations :
is the new action compulsory ?
no , the negoti@@ ated software updates are voluntary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the oblig@@ atory updates previously apply only for the vehicles , the Schuman software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Office of the Federal Office ( KBA ) has arranged its retro@@ fitting .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
the manufacturers have announced a rapid conversion in the next few months , but no exact date is called .
Daimler informed those interested parties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it be due to an inspection , it will be done in their frame . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long will the exchange equipment go up ?
&quot; difficult to say , &quot; mean S@@ met@@ an .
the closure of the manufacturer &apos;s commitment as well as from the political pressure .
&quot; because we have seen will@@ ingly , the car manufacturer did not act on the subject of the environment . &quot;
how long shall the update last ?
the conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ up could be , a date to get an appointment .
what are motor@@ ists who do not drive a car by BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?
the ACE to wait .
presumably foreign manufacturers would follow , so S@@ met@@ anin would .
is now a massive sale of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE fears this .
but just in the regions where the s@@ verb@@ ank you are above .
in rural areas there are no impair@@ ment losses for older diesel .
the ACE does not have to wait for sale .
LL Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the gl@@ am@@ our@@ able events in Washington .
the first prize ceremony under President Tr@@ ump promises to become polit@@ ically .
one of the winners will not come - from protest .
LL Cool J ( 49 ) gets the first Rap@@ per one of the cov@@ eted awards from the renowned Kennedy Center .
like the cultural institution on Thursday , there were also singer Gloria E@@ ste@@ fan ( 59 ) , Li@@ on@@ el Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the chore@@ ograph@@ er Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) .
the awards were delivered at the beginning of December .
traditionally , US President Donald Tr@@ ump is holding a reception and together with his wife Mel@@ ania at the award ceremony .
the award winner of the Progressive TV series is a pri@@ z@@ ew@@ inner winner of Le@@ ar announced to w@@ ai@@ ve the participation in the gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this presi@@ dency has decided to neg@@ lec@@ ting the arts and human rights to neg@@ lec@@ ting - even the means of understanding - and the dis@@ bur@@ dened me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old E@@ ste@@ fan stressed that she will use the conversation with Tr@@ ump in order to clari@@ fy their vision .
that is named after the former President John F. Kennedy named Kennedy @-@ Centre , is the biggest cultural institution in the U.S. capital .
among the former premier@@ es are Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Franklin , Robert De N@@ iro , George Lucas , Tom Han@@ ks and St@@ ing .
we make the city li@@ worthy
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ master , continues in R@@ ente in the next year .
but the site is already written - but suitable applic@@ ants are ra@@ r .
for 31 years W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister
and the work still makes it great fun as he convey@@ s up in the press conference .
it &apos;s reports of varied , but challenging tasks that wait for his success@@ ors .
at the same time , it appears that there is no application to fill the requirements .
the city is searching for the next possible time a architects or construction engineer .
so - under the cont@@ emp@@ t of the regular period of notice - even enough time for a el@@ aboration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; da Has@@ lach was responsible for the administrative community as a sub@@ ordin@@ arily building authority , the applic@@ ants must submit relevant financial statements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this function wants to keep the city in any case .
if they cannot be able to fill them out , the citizen would have to go to Offen@@ burg to Offen@@ burg .
but civil proximity to the city and himself are important , says W@@ acker who reports from a good operation lim@@ a as well as good mood between the authority and citizens .
more than 30 years in the office , some important projects were collected , looking back to the wi@@ pers with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city of life &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is about the building &apos;s office and his staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future , varied projects on the agenda : re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a areas and the low lift parking space are approximately .
the old bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , also the stadium san@@ itation is still on the topic .
the latter alone will strike at around 1.5 million euros , &quot; if we are doing it right , &quot; it was doing .
&quot; all in all , great tasks are waiting for my success@@ ors .
the work here is fun . &quot;
stone age is available for a Stadt@@ bau@@ master of large games room .
Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s &apos;s own building yard and gar@@ dener could be flexi@@ bly responded to many thanks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so W@@ acker , and the design of the green plants will be praised by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the Old Town is as Ensemble under monument protection , it is important to have &quot; an eye for it , &quot; if Neu@@ haus has been approved , emphas@@ ises the separ@@ ating Stadt@@ bau@@ master .
the Stadt@@ bau@@ master bears high responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is the builder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end everything goes on my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with care and coordination , he can count as many years of experience : Markus Neum@@ ai@@ er ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been in existence for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( deep construction ) has been working for 15 years .
even though his successor is long , W@@ acker wishes : &quot; we are looking for someone who really identified and want to stay in the place . &quot;
for continu@@ ity is not only important for a good operational climate , but also for the further design of the city .
whoever wants to be inher@@ ited by Roland W@@ acker , should have completed studies as a diploma engineer or Bachelor with the development of architecture , and have a good knowledge of technical knowledge in the fields of construction and building plan@@ ation .
urban development and civil engineering , building planning , civil engineering , municipal farm house with building yard and municipal gar@@ dening equipment , as well as sub @-@ civil authority , including monument protection .
bike on leads thrown : southern route
according to the police , the previously unknown k@@ iller developed the blue bike from the railway track in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ese road ( B@@ 116 ) on the lines .
these were so bad@@ ly damaged , that the coming freight trains had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male perpet@@ rators and search for the night hours after them .
near the Tat@@ ras were a thr@@ ott@@ le roller and a bike driver was observed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ anno@@ ying kingdom , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said E@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
or the perpet@@ rators have brought itself in great risk and end@@ anger@@ ed the train traffic .
in addition to the damage to the Lo@@ k and the system , as well as the late @-@ minute drive and the costs for rail transport , even more @-@ ray of the railroad customers could also come to the perpet@@ rators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a total of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to go out of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damage was fixed on Friday afternoon , rail traffic on the ground floor could be guided without disabilities .
just under ten staff were dealt on Friday morning , two of which were to the remote traffic .
freight trains fell not , but they had delay .
according to the Ö@@ BB spokes@@ person Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be exchanged around 200 metres of upper lines .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , milk products and chocolate could help IB@@ D ( anti @-@ infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory loan )
red meat and chocolate can sound for your digest@@ ive system such as a night@@ mare .
but a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products could have the symptoms of patients with infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory bo@@ wel diseases .
the un@@ common condition that affects approximately 1.3 million in the US and in Britain 300,000 , causes mag@@ nets , recur@@ ring or blu@@ epr@@ ints , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
while those affected are usually come to avoid meat and dairy products , researchers found that the essential amino acid tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an of proteins found that the essential amino acid tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an of proteins that promote a toler@@ ant al@@ m .
the conduc@@ tive researchers , Dr. Marco Colonna , declared that immune cells in Dar@@ m pat@@ rol , to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide themselves in the food , did not enter into the body .
cells that are able to resolve inflamm@@ ation , are balanced of cells that protect the tolerance and protect the body without sensitive tissue .
if the balance is due to inflamm@@ ation , it can result in an anti @-@ infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory not@@ ation .
in experiments was found that a type of tolerance transport immun@@ cell in mice is required to bear a certain bacter@@ ium in their bow@@ els .
and bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an - one of the blocks of proteins - to resolve the appearance of the cells .
Professor Colonna said : &quot; we have a connection between a bacteria art - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ illus reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the intest@@ inal micro@@ bi@@ al , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an the mice in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and an in@@ tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an rich nutrition is toler@@ able , less infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory intest@@ inal mil@@ ie@@ us , if the same system also uses people .
the post @-@ doctoral researcher Dr. Lu@@ isa Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan was seeking a kind immune cell that had the tolerance found that a group of study mice had such cells , but a other group of the same tribe , but had not accommodated it .
they suspected that the difference with the intest@@ inal micro@@ bi@@ ans of mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , who usually live in the stomach &apos;s intest@@ inal tract .
the mice of mice were found DNA sequ@@ enz@@ es and were found six bacterial species found in mice with immune cells , but without them were missing in mice .
mice were detected in a ster@@ ile environment , so that a intest@@ inal micro@@ bi@@ ome was missing and they were not developed this kind of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and immune cells .
in order to understand how bacteria results in the immune system , the researchers noticed L. reu@@ ter@@ i in a liquid and then led small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ripe immune cells , which were isolated from the mice .
immun@@ o@@ gens developed to toler@@ ant cells .
as the active component of the liquid was cleaned , it proved to be known as an additional product of tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an Met@@ abol@@ ism , which is known as In@@ do@@ l @-@ 3 @-@ Mil@@ k acid .
if the researchers have doubled the amount of tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an in the feed of mice , the number of such cells were hal@@ ved around 50 percent , but when the tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ onist were hal@@ ved , the number of cells fell by half .
Dr. Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan declared that people can protect the same toler@@ ant cells such as mice , and that most of us will protect us in our gast@@ ro @-@ intest@@ ines .
it is not known whether tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an an@@ nex products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i have found the cells in humans such as in mice , but defects in genes were found on tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an in people with infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory loan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote that these cells are inflamm@@ ation on the inner surface of the gut . &quot; &quot; &quot;
potenti@@ ary can lead high tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i to an expansion of this population . &quot;
Jose Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has committed a &quot; gen@@ ius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
in Manchester United has signed a &quot; gen@@ ius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , &quot; Jose Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho believes after the mid@@ fiel@@ der on Wednesday evening his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria .
the 40 million pounds signature from Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre@@ season game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid starts on Tuesday , and impressive in the holder role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira .
however , M@@ atic was excluded from the Prepar@@ ation @-@ Asia tour of the blues and only managed to return to Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho in just 45 minutes that he had to improve before the beginning of the Premier@@ ship season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a gen@@ ius in the way , as he think - he th@@ inks football , &quot; said Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho .
&quot; we will help him to be ready to be later than later . &quot;
in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u in the Avi@@ va Stadium , as Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho his start @-@ XI had formed for the start of the season .
the Independent In this week that Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho wanted to wish three further new liabilities , but it insi@@ sted that the club has already provided a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to meet three of its four priority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three of four to get to the association , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happy if they have been four of four , but they have given great effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; painted &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pilots flew from Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in US state of Michigan , and moved to the form of a Dream@@ liner over the USA , which are several thousand kilometres .
the action took 18 hours and one minute .
on the radar screen the form of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole was a cardio test for new engines .
Boeing had already made such advertising earlier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the number &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 787 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the Boeing logo was painted in the sky . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new underground car for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
but how the wind rot@@ ates : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still chief of the SPD boss , he also looked before elections before elections , with a certain concern to Berlin .
only no interference from the party central , merely no counter wind from the covenant - so was the most important desire for election campaign .
since Martin Schulz , the party has changed dramatically .
since then , employees from the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus watch the events of the SPD @-@ reg@@ ated state capit@@ als in the SPD @-@ reg@@ ated state capit@@ als .
what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year , would not be described in the case with the counter@@ wind .
there were dr@@ ills .
and one after the others .
the German CDU CDU looks at the end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony a general signal against Ko@@ al@@ itions of SPD and Gre@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s once more : red @-@ green , simply not reliable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said CDU @-@ Secretary Peter Tau@@ ber the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the surprising leader of a Green @-@ de@@ pu@@ ties , the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) over@@ thrown into a severe crisis .
five months before the Parliament election , its red @-@ green coalition won their one @-@ vote majority to the opposition from CDU and F@@ DP .
the Green Party Leader Michael Kell@@ ner has called the ab@@ tr@@ ater@@ restrial Green Party El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets to return to their mandate .
the super@@ vis@@ ing for the CDU means a clear deteri@@ oration of the elec@@ toral .
El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets must immediately give her mandate , &quot; said the Swiss business leader and election campaign of the Green Party ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I sig@@ ills a SPD election when on Friday morning the new Hi@@ ob@@ s@@ message reaches the party central . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Weil , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands after the survi@@ ving of the green de@@ pu@@ ties of El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets for the CDU without their own government .
it is the preliminary highlight of all the rows of large and small cris@@ es in the SPD state associations .
and no one knows what next comes .
the mis@@ ery began with the unexpected defeat at the Saarland election in March .
a blue eye , no longer , the com@@ ra@@ des were killed .
according to the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
it was then - and indeed , everything was considerably worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the de@@ mar@@ bles , the Düsseldorf @-@ Ple@@ ite hau@@ te the party smooth .
in the weeks , the com@@ ra@@ des were cum@@ ber@@ ed in the weeks afterwards .
then , when they had just got a new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg .
and with him came the next deep .
Mayor O@@ la@@ f Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD land@@ lord , lost his Nim@@ bus in that weekend , because he sat in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie during his city .
and because he had been wrong in the crisis communication then pretty everything that you can do wrong .
since then fighting for his political survival .
so now Stephan Weil now .
because of the VW @-@ exhaust air and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Lower Saxony Prime Minister has already been with criticism in criticism .
Mi@@ ese outline values came added .
nevertheless , or perhaps , because , because in the past few weeks , Weil tried more strongly to set acc@@ ents in the covenant .
the purch@@ aser of the former Mayor of Hannover , to build his power in Berlin , was not hidden in the environment by Martin Schulz .
they let him grant him , because they spoke a stabil@@ ization of the party .
now the exact opposite could occur .
in this case , because there is no fault in the existence of internal affairs , there is no fault .
and doesn &apos;t know about it .
therefore , the com@@ ra@@ des p@@ itted themselves to hold their own rows .
her anger is based on the gre@@ enery , and here primarily on the ab@@ domin@@ ating par@@ li@@ ars in T@@ jack@@ ets .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and demo@@ cra@@ dle about the interests of all others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , chief of the parties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , Chief of the Parties in the SPD Bundestag , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. T@@ jack@@ ets has not been elected as a director for her person as a director , but on the country &apos;s list of Lower Saxony , elected Lower Saxony .
the logical consequence , it would be that it returns to its mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , Chief of the SPD Bundestag , compl@@ ains a &quot; un@@ democratic man@@ oeu@@ vre . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the voters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; voters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people have made Stephan Weil appointed Minister @-@ President , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann who performs the Lower Saxony as a leading candidate in the Bundestag election , the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the personal career solution of a future CDU de@@ pu@@ ties , the election result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he asked to clari@@ fy the back@@ grounds .
I want to know if there was more or more that the CDU Lower Saxony has been given .
conveyor belts for local core III
anyone who wants to renov@@ ate his house in the years can be coming soon from the country .
about this inform@@ al Mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler , and three representatives of pi@@ g city development on Wednesday in sensation .
at the beginning of the information event Sch@@ in@@ dler gave once a look back to the so far .
since 1991 , there is a sensation in sensation .
at that time , in the area of san@@ itation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the country of Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two third of the funding amount .
in the san@@ itation area II from 2005 to 2016 , the surplus was still 60 percent .
for Sch@@ in@@ dler the existing san@@ ings are a &quot; successful project &quot; - it is finally important to promote internal development , and not only new building areas .
on April 4 , one of the government agencies of Karlsruhe has received the information that there will be a san@@ itation area III .
the funding amount is 8@@ 33 333 euros , of which are 500 000 Euro from the land , the rest of the church sensation .
how is a san@@ itation area now ?
you will continue to investigate your sk@@ in@@ dler , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are .
but it plays an important role in the planned area at all , to renov@@ ate .
this may also be post@@ p@@ one if the territory limit could also shift again .
the Ste@@ er came on Wednesday evening by Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
cell@@ ars presented the contents of the federal states program &quot; Social City , &quot; in whose framework the structures would be carried out then .
the core of the program are the Rev@@ olt of the City , improving the residential and working conditions and the expansion of the infrastructure .
the measures would be object @-@ continu@@ ance , that is carried out per plot .
the san@@ itation area would finally be determined as a statute .
the approval period for funding is from 1 January 2017 until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
however , until September of this year , however , only the survey was carried out , in the framework of those involved in the san@@ itation area , a questionnaire should be completed .
in November or December , as possible as a set of propositions , it should be possible to begin with the plum@@ bing in the next year .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann subsequently declared that each commune had to perform the forec@@ asted pre @-@ investigations .
it is therefore , to evaluate the municipal abuse of abuse and to decide when to be rehabil@@ it@@ ated and in what extent .
there will also be a san@@ itation letter in the land register for the respective plot .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come again after feelings and make a picture of the location , she promised .
Got@@ zel stressed a substantial success factor for the project to be the participation of the parties .
this is why there will be questionn@@ aires who will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and will be filled out until the end of the summer holidays .
the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; buildings and land arc &quot; in which it is among other things around the building condition and the san@@ itation prospects .
in the grey questionnaire , the &quot; household and housing , &quot; can be used to size , distribution and residents of a home .
the blue &quot; operating bow &quot; is only filled to fill in the premises business premises .
however , in mind that , Got@@ zel , pointed out that a filled questionnaire is not simultaneously an application for funding .
in addition , new construction measures cannot be eligible .
Sch@@ in@@ dler emphas@@ ized that the distribution of funding according to the &quot; Wind@@ policy principle &quot; functional - who first comes , m@@ ah@@ lt first .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t book a conveyor belt later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; finally , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; village of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; village of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was shown in order to make a restoration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fl@@ ashing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
British invent@@ ors itself sets a micro@@ chip to come with a hand@@ motion in house and car
a British inventor is the first in the country , which is equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his office , and can even start his office with a hand@@ motion .
Steven North@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thum@@ bs and index and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simpli@@ fy their lives with technology by his company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he has joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , a consult@@ an@@ a@@ esth@@ esia in the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , in order to ensure that the im@@ plant process is performed after medical standard .
the technology resem@@ bles a cats and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. North@@ am also wants to change the pal@@ aces of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , everything for a surcharge of £ 300 per lock .
the married father of one has now installed both at home and at his BMW Z4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel .
the promotional costs of the White House cost the tax@@ pay@@ ers thousands
the decision of the White House , an Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter to fly to the South La@@ wn for an event that accounts for American production in the last month , cost tax@@ pay@@ ers to the information of the military , which was transferred to the TI@@ ME Magazine , up to $ 24@@ ,000 .
the green white S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president was on board , was the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American architecture .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice @-@ President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour through products from all 50 states .
the helicopter in Connecticut was made in addition to a yacht from Ma@@ ine , a fire @-@ fire car from Wisconsin and a forkli@@ ft from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
the Military Office of the White House demanded the presence of helicop@@ ters in a frag@@ ment@@ ary order or FRA@@ GO , barely 36 hours before helicopter in the South La@@ wn , after records of the Navy Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 ) , the unit , which is responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just wanted to be aware of this , because it is an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Com@@ man@@ de@@ ur of H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote on the eve of the event for its pre@@ set , Deputy Nav@@ al Command Commander for Aviation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the message showed that the helicopter arrived on 17 July at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning at the South La@@ wn at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning , and so long until the lawn was vac@@ ated between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening .
the note adds that if your departure from the White House should be delayed , due to the limitation of working hours a second crew for the return flight would be needed .
the original air@@ crew was found during the helicopter in the helicopter while the security staff remained at the plane during the time at the plane .
excerpt from the TI@@ ME records were not clear if ultimately a second flight of flight was necessary .
at Brands Hatch , the Bundes@@ rat Act provides state ownership for political purposes .
data sets show that H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 is asked if the event could viol@@ ate the determination .
&quot; a question that we introduced , was whether it was a violation of the Hatch acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; he wrote the commander .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sounds , as if you are closed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was Deputy Commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the &quot; Made in America &quot; event was called &quot; Made in America &quot; from the White House as an official event and had not been covered by the Hatch Act .
but there &apos;s official events have political col@@ ones .
at the event , the president issued a violation of the reform of health reform that was in the Senate , and prop@@ ag@@ ated the efforts to influence the government regulations .
the use of the plane , known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly any new phenomenon .
pre@@ sidents are obliged to use them for the trip .
but your use only for a photo @-@ operating system is unusual .
Tr@@ ump led an investigation into an investigation as the Presi@@ dential plane in front of his first campaign in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that use the use of the presidential aircraft by its predecessor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House is thr@@ illed by the show &quot; Made &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 states that are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Deputy Commander of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 cre@@ ws often lead training trips around Washington and South La@@ wn to depos@@ e the US President in the White House with precise cuts .
at the beginning of July , when Tr@@ ump was at the G20 summit in Germany , H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 led 58 practice sessions across the White House .
the flight for &quot; Made in America &quot; event counted during the training requirement of the flight crew for the month , said an official .
hel@@ ik@@ op@@ ter units flew in addition to 11 hours on that day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions . &quot;
the White House said that the tax@@ pay@@ ers won the burden for no other pro@@ ps which were presented at the event .
a speaker of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky said , the company was not involved in it to al@@ locate the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 does not have bud@@ get@@ ary drawings for presidential trips , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to St@@ und@@ ent@@ ari@@ zation of the US Ministry of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D attachment rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D was 24.@@ 380 USD per flight .
recording of the unit recorded flight time of the plane as 30 minutes from the home base of Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House argu@@ ed that the actual costs for the operation of helicop@@ ters were far below that rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers on the basis of estimates for issu@@ ing kits is highly ir@@ re@@ leader , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs which are included in the annual funding . &quot;
according to a RA@@ ND study from the year 2015 , the replacement parts for Do@@ D do not contain the personnel costs , but consider the cost of fuel , maintenance and conclusion .
at this time , the former Press@@ ing pre@@ cher of the White House , S@@ ean Sp@@ encer , the use of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present these week things that are produced in America , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sp@@ acious . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know that S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and the State of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I go out that hundreds , if not even thousands of people depend on it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think , like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have un@@ ti@@ relessly .
it is appropriate to raise that . &quot;
it was not clear if Tr@@ ump was inter@@ viewed with the helicopter when he entered his tour through the South La@@ wn to the event , but he sat down in the seat of a fire brig@@ ade .
in the White House , Tr@@ ump came to representatives of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and scher@@ sleben with the media about his own fleet of corporate products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky very good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the president , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have three of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

top re@@ iter of the Second tennis league occurs at the table third Su@@ ch dor@@ fer SV .
the TC Blue @-@ Weiss Ne@@ uss will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m. in Kiel at the table third Su@@ ch dor@@ fer SV .
despite five games still mac@@ ell@@ os@@ er balance , the leading position of the Second tennis league has given the sense of reality for reality .
team@@ head Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has respect the ad@@ versaries before the opponent .
&quot; this is a compact team that plays in quite similar formation .
just on the back positions I find the crew very well . &quot;
for class and stability at the Su@@ ch dor@@ fer SV , especially the imports from the high North .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Dan@@ es and Fin@@ ishing can even refer to the Davis Cup in the Davis Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and they are too strong in the double , &quot; Z@@ ay with view on Har@@ ri Hel@@ i@@ ova@@ ara ( Sweden ) , Andr@@ e G@@ ö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ör@@ en and Es@@ ben Ol@@ esen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen , and Andreas B@@ jer@@ re@@ h@@ us ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s always hard for us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you need a good portion of luck . &quot;
the Ne@@ uss@@ er team is practical for the trip to the high North .

how America could harm OMV
really happy , Donald Tr@@ ump is not happy when he was on Wednesday evening his signature under the law of forced sanctions against Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his work , the law en@@ acted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I packed a few &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels cont@@ um@@ bled against the US pre@@ cl@@ ash .
after all , the design does not see the design that help the Russians will help to build gas pi@@ pel@@ ines into the EU .
since then , since then , investors have been financed with local OMV since then , together with other European firms , North Stream 2 has been co @-@ financed with other European firms .
the thre@@ ats is enormous .
nevertheless , it is too early for a estim@@ ation of the consequences , so the official statement of the oil group .
in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump would have to raise the sanctions even by Executive Order to life .
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has looked at what the Group could ab@@ duc@@ es and who really can do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , Deputy Head of the Department of youth welfare , is that a good message : &quot; we are all very pleased . &quot;
bo@@ iled still except house : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and delivers fresh@@ ly cooked cooled .
the city operates in the area of 46 kinder@@ gart@@ ens area , in 44 the children get to lunch a warm meal .
2,@@ 800 children are at the tables each year , and the need grows steadily .
&quot; meanwhile , not only children who are taken care of 45 week@@ days in the K@@ ita , are discussed by Pom@@ mer@@ ance .
&quot; the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour supervision when children stay until 14 o &apos;clock . &quot;
46 participation forces from the 1st of September kitchen : you can warm the delivered meals , supplement the food , raw food and fruit , por@@ tion@@ ate the meal , enter food from , rinse and clean the kitchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employees are assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ its . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the size - there are two groups just like seventh troops - decides about the hour range .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the kitchen staff now belong to K@@ ita @-@ Team , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ ance &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much stronger and it is easier to implement educational concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of course it is : healthy eating and cooking lessons .
&quot; the kids should help you prepare food . &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen @-@ power supply to the team is useful .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a well @-@ known power in K@@ ita , a person who tru@@ sts in them , and not constantly changing people . &quot;
this continu@@ ity is important for children .
the pur@@ ge of the K@@ ita spaces - so far as the task of kitchen workers - will be done by special cleaning agents in the future .
this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has also the charm thanks to the quality improvement of the kitchen performance even the charm that they have been issued in the cost between own reg@@ iment and foreign citizens as the most economic service , is called the Press Office .
and this , although 46 participation forces will be newly set .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours fall at around 750 people in the educ@@ ating range , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ ance &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

G@@ MB concern about investments in the Mc@@ Vit@@ ie factory in Glasgow
a union union wants to make a long @-@ term commitment to the production of the bis@@ cu@@ it manufacturer Mc@@ Vit@@ ie on the long @-@ term commitment to production in the Glasgow plant .
G@@ MB Scotland said that the company would weigh over the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross site .
more than 500 employees work in the plant , which was created next to other products Hob@@ no@@ bs and R@@ ich Tea K@@ ek@@ se .
Mc@@ V@@ ities owner Pl@@ adi@@ s said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
he added that employees and trade union representatives &quot; would be &quot; first experienced , &quot; if their activities would change their activities .
in a letter to the branch manager of the company called G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vit@@ ie &apos;s to external &quot; concerns that financing of production lines are not required . &quot;
G@@ MB @-@ Senior @-@ Organ@@ izer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; the fact that we cannot win by General @-@ Site Manager for the future of need and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross , affects our members .
families of families have been working here and working forces strongly concentrate on the local community and the large @-@ room Glasgow , an important pillar for de@@ cent employment in a field of high unemployment and social action .
hence , under the perspective of work@@ places , the wage and prosper@@ ity , and before the background of the Bre@@ x@@ it , the increasing life management and the chronic production decline , the eastern end of Glasgow ur@@ gently ur@@ gently need a flor@@ ent@@ eous production licence at Mc@@ Vit@@ ie . &quot;
a spokes@@ man of pl@@ adi@@ s said : &quot; the branch manager at T@@ oll@@ cross took only yesterday a letter of G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will respond directly to that , since we appreciate the continuous commitment at employees and trade union representatives .
two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were discussed open .
we discussed with the staff that we are working as all companies that are active in an extremely competitive and un@@ certain economic climate control , as well as for all our business areas and locations - to stay competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years we invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross site , particularly in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we recogn@@ ise the inheritance of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production facility and quite an . if our company runs at the site , the employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to learn this . &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona war@@ ned three years ago ?
the site of La League likes her interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Germain is not sent in their persecution by Ne@@ ym@@ ar after they had given an offer of £ 189 million to resolve his free@@ wheel cl@@ ause , but they war@@ ned in Barcelona three years ago ?
the sensational approach has been heated up in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the existing brand , where Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United last season for 89 million pounds .
after the termination , Ne@@ ym@@ ar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the most affordable professional athl@@ ete in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is angry with the way , how Ne@@ ym@@ ar has under@@ gone his way to the outside , although a source in the vicinity of the Catalan executive board insi@@ sts that the club always has given his best to worry about his arrival from Santos in 2013 .
but was the soccer world war@@ ned three years ago by the PS@@ G President before this view ?
in Manchester City 2014 , at the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ i@@ di , Nasser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for each club to sign one of the best players of PS@@ G .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not concerned because they don &apos;t touch one of our players , then we will contact them in opposition to them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
but if they try to sign one of our players at sign , this will have consequences . &quot;
in Barcelona , this line seems to have exceeded the Spanish association at the beginning of this summer interest in the PS@@ G middle field player Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti .
PS@@ G made clear that it would not allow it to travel to the International from Italy under any circumstances and in Barcelona the consequences of this intervention could feel that they lost one of their price offers for Ne@@ ym@@ ar .

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Report dis@@ bur@@ dened by Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ estic Policy report on the ab@@ uses of the Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
the author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the abuse sc@@ and@@ al at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ estic atzen continues for discussions .
Christian prophecy , spokes@@ person of reform movement &quot; We are church , &quot; declared by the former Reg@@ ens@@ burger bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller , as well as from the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the emer@@ gen@@ ius Benedict XVI .
it would be very serve to see the Catholic Church if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger all of its own sub@@ missions or their then false assessment of the processes would press .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast , the Vatican City &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Os@@ servat@@ ore Rom@@ ano , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; on the other , critic@@ ised that in the coverage of violence in the Dom@@ estic Policy with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two @-@ degree measure &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
regarding the inter@@ ventions in Regensburg , no one that it should be prevented for &quot; con@@ front@@ ly and damaged deeds &quot; that would be avoided , but the &quot; degree of media man@@ ipulation , &quot; such as the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , hist@@ ori@@ ans and member of the National Italian Bio@@ eth@@ ics Committee .
&quot; the attraction , the Catholic Church as a source of all evil experience , is already part of the everyday experience and prepare the public opinion that for normal , &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia .
also prin@@ cip@@ ally Gloria of Th@@ urn and tax@@ is thought in an interview with the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk : &quot; you would like to go on the church and this is a folded thread . &quot;
Moreover , they pointed out that in their youth &quot; hits a very normal educational agent , &quot; to be done with children , as I was one , finished . &quot;
they are un@@ fair to use today &apos;s standards for earlier decades , because the world have changed .
in connection with reports about the mis@@ fortune cases , Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared .
in completely wrong , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who was translated with R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; My brother of Pope &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he considers the results of the final report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report presented by the dioc@@ ese of Regensburg with the re@@ conn@@ aissance lawyer Ulrich Weber ?
a total of 5@@ 47 Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ estic Policy were used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s &quot; with great pl@@ au@@ sible &quot; victims of over@@ handles , 67 Dom@@ estic sexual abuse .
in the final report it is called Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg : &quot; summar@@ izing , that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases of physical and psychological violence have been applied .
the punishment for school@@ children could even fall heavy for the pupils .
in contrast to numerous other things , many victims , estimated that many victims , estimated the general humanity of R. estimated and therefore , in numerous cases , despite violence even more positive memories were linked to him . &quot;
in the interview , Hes@@ emann , why the final report on the abuse of abuse during the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ estic Policy Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in his opinion .
Mr Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the inci@@ dents of violence against the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ estic Policy , &quot; is a contra@@ dic@@ tory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a lifting of many students his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Human@@ ity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the other , it appears also as a Chol@@ eri@@ ker and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , which has been handy for the Ö@@ f@@ teren when a domain rate is musi@@ cally no top performance .
how can you be as his Bi@@ ograph@@ er this final report ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you read the trouble and read all the 440 pages long report from the front to the rear , it is necessary to ask what is the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger at all in it .
just 8 pages dedicated to him and it is clearly acquitted of any sus@@ pic@@ ion of medi@@ ation or co @-@ knowledge in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the violence of violence at the pre@@ school was also taking place outside its efficiency .
one can cause him to know here@@ after , too late or first clari@@ fication was not seriously taken enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sky &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; heaven &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was taken from practically all respon@@ dents than - so lit@@ eral - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so the wide majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger describes a very excellent witness , as &quot; warm &quot; , &quot; really good , &quot; expert &quot; and &quot; intelli@@ gible Teacher , who supplies the guys regularly with cake , cookies and Bon@@ b@@ ons and &quot; always from grapes of children . &quot;
only a minority is concerned about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high quality moti@@ fs , which led to W@@ ut@@ ab@@ ov@@ chen already .
that he did not only cast along with chairs and cast the key and on the floor , but also ear@@ thly guys ever moved to the hair or ears , he had already regre@@ t@@ ted himself before years and has become exc@@ used .
however , to its hon@@ our@@ ing , however , such gu@@ ardi@@ ans must have been widely used in frag@@ ile time , the 1960s and 1970s , widely used to parents such as teachers .
do you know such breeding methods yet ?
of course , I think each of us who was born before 1968 .
I have experienced this still in a world school , a state gymn@@ asium .
compared with what it goes in this report , namely to the de@@ struc@@ tive sexual abuse and the violence at the pre@@ school , the fre@@ il@@ ich Bag@@ at@@ ellen are .
it is asking you whether it was not rather with his acquain@@ t@@ ness and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI that many media have just moved on him .
at the Bavarian Pope , many of them who have never understood it , still je@@ al@@ ous .
the truth is : the report re@@ lie@@ ve Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
in connection with the report a lot about the subject of abuse during the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ estic Policy was reported in connection with the report .
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the final report also any processing or co @-@ knowledge associated with regard to sexual abuse on the load ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : very much no .
no one of the 67 victims of sexual ass@@ ess@@ ments claims to have entrusted to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were consecrated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never have forgotten me to speak with my father or my mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a person responsible for the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was all very embar@@ r@@ assing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real problem in the En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment of sexual abuse was and is , that most of the victims are silent .
if they trusted not even parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then definitely not a ch@@ orus , who would have been working as a collective of the perpet@@ rator .
how do you rate the Dom@@ estic student of R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of failure ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a questi@@ oned student formulated this way : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case , in which he would have been able ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) tim@@ est@@ able and could have been able to stop the perpet@@ rators .
I think it ... also for really ab@@ sur@@ d , to accept that ... Bu@@ ben ever or clear@@ er or clear@@ er , as opposed to their parents , inter@@ nat@@ s@@ senior managers , confi@@ denti@@ als etc .
that one speaks with him about sex ... - un@@ th@@ ink@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in advance to the affected students and / or their environment , the report could not be confirmed in the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in terms of sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is really free of charge .
so it cannot be accused him to prevent him or to display him .
therefore there is no reason to bring his good name with these rebel@@ li@@ ous crimes , as it was unfortunately happened in some cases .
in the media there was a lot of &quot; non@@ violence &quot; at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ estic Policy .
the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of &quot; Weg@@ ener &quot; in the report .
does he have to live with this design ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : that &apos;s the great problem that miss everything missing and men@@ tia in the coverage became a giant mel@@ ange of sexually abuse and non@@ violence and somewhere , in the middle , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but this is exactly what is a mis@@ use of the report .
there is therefore clean separately : between the pre@@ school and the gymn@@ asium of the Dom@@ estic Policy , between sexual abuse and violence as well as , we say once , other inci@@ dents .
the report also covers inci@@ dents from the period since 1945 , so also from four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not ch@@ oral for Dom@@ estic atzen .
the whole horri@@ ble test ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases , in which young men of sa@@ c teachers have been regularly colored and mal@@ ign@@ ited , all of them were present at the pre@@ school in Et@@ ter@@ zh@@ ausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen where really sc@@ and@@ al@@ ous states have to have reigned .
but with whom Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he got the boys only to face when they were already at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ ic school .
on the same as the very most witnesses were bet@@ aine , the theme of &quot; Pre@@ school &quot; tab@@ oo .
it was only happy to be escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; par@@ a@@ ean &quot; states .
what was different at the Dom@@ estic atz@@ mar school ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there was already discipline , but no longer @-@ dist@@ al violence .
and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , at which the report comes to the conclusion that &quot; many victims were estim@@ ating the general humanity of R. , and therefore , in numerous cases , despite violence even positive remin@@ ders of him . &quot;
only the alleg@@ ation remains to have taken away .
but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods , in which it was reported by the states on the pre@@ school .
the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish and responsible for their predecess@@ ors at a school , which he had not worked and responsible for it ( so the witness ) would not hear anything , and then again in 1993 .
Georg R@@ atz@@ inger stopped the ears in front of the states ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , since 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ ymn@@ asium who even re@@ produced the report .
he insi@@ sts that in the pre@@ school , he will continue to practice the test penalty . &quot;
already in view of the danger of negative pres@@ sur@@ ing public investigation , he was ur@@ gent in@@ adequate .
that was of course at a time , as legal clarity , as a test in Bavaria had been banned in Bavaria .
before that they took place in a legal grey zone , as each of us knows still white .
there was also heavy for him to estimate , where the suffer@@ ers were perhaps ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated or dramatic , and where really the permissible limit was exceeded .
but they can &apos;t say , he would have taken away always .
that is not true .
the test penalty was officially abolished in Bavaria in 1980 .
Fürst@@ in Gloria of Th@@ urn and tax@@ is claimed to apply today &apos;s ped@@ agog@@ ical standards at the time of time .
how do you see that ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : we were talking about the &quot; Fall@@ out of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; so the danger of the past to present moral standards .
since the prin@@ cess has already right .
but this is true of course not for sexual abuse , who was ab@@ hor@@ red at all times and also not for what was broken up in the pre@@ school and violence against innocent children &apos;s school , that goes far beyond that time .
that &apos;s all really aw@@ ful and I &apos;m glad that it is finally closed .
but at the same time I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , because all this had nothing to do with him .
his means to discipline and Pun@@ ishment , so ear@@ chers and ears to go to the hair and ears were widespread in the 1970s .
then , as physical punishment then was forbidden , he also kept stri@@ pped .
what is the image of his reg@@ burger time Georg R@@ atz@@ inger for the talks with you for the book &quot; My brother of Pope &quot; ?
did the issue check out also for the language ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it &apos;s about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedict XVI , tells of his perspective , there the domains played only one side roll .
nevertheless , I don &apos;t forget that he conducted a new reg@@ iment there .
but also this must be said : without these perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without the un@@ conditional discipline , it would probably hardly been possible to form a UNESCO World ambassador to form the true cultural ambassador in Europe and its musical tradition that went straight to the US ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with cookies and Bon@@ b@@ ons alone , you have no big singers and in front of every success , right in which area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ win@@ dy .
than what a person do you have experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger on the talks at their book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : thanks to the work on the book and beyond that I experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really good and always to be wonderful , hum@@ orous , deep glaz@@ ing and warm people , from whom you can &apos;t imagine that he could do something like a fly .
I get regularly with how many former Dom@@ estic Policy still exists today , 23 years after his retirement , regularly visit him to visit him - he is almost blind - and he is as a member of their family .
those who did not forgive him today , that he once was strictly to them , are clearly in the minority .
most of the domains are grat@@ eful to him today that he has enrich@@ ed their lives and brought to them the world of music .
and that he always had a good , v@@ ä@@ ter@@ nal teachers - a str@@ ingent father , that may be , but it was a del@@ ight@@ ful resp@@ ect@@ ful , to whom they still watch and honour them .
and please , even quite clear : everything that is necessary for him are educ@@ ating methods that were at the time on the agenda .
we can be happy that we have long been overcome this time .
but it is highly un@@ just , a man only because he is promin@@ ently and has a prominent brother to make a medi@@ al sin .
there is the evil intention , that is behind , only going to be obvious .
because the report that has just been published , reli@@ eves him .
now the attack area would have acquired a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who had acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bavaria and maybe nobody wanted to know the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ estic Policy , finally in peace .
