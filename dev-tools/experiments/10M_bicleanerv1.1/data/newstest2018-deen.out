Munich 1856 : four cards that change your view to the city
a w@@ ander @-@ st@@ alt , where you@@ ths are to meet today .
a tomb chapel , where the tunnel is dug for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small gar@@ den@@ ers manage the impact of farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories about days .
it is nerv@@ es when landing cards are not currently .
that knows everyone who had to be off@@ ended , because the Auto @-@ Nav@@ i takes place a green meadow rather than the Auto @-@ Nav@@ i .
the historical maps of the digital Bayern At@@ l@@ ases , an offer of Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as Bayern of the State Government , are all other than currently - but just therefore very in@@ clusi@@ vely .
especially when you compare it with current online cards .
then it is clear how cities and municipalities in the area of Munich Mercury has changed since the 19th century .
the digital Bavaria Atlas is a flip @-@ carpet , which is not equal to such as such as such .
in the large over@@ sight card we have been working for cities and communities more detailed cards , so @-@ called Ur@@ ph@@ onic sheets .
according to the Bavarian survey@@ ing Administration , between 1810 and 1864 , the first measurement of Bay@@ erns were created .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leaders occupied Bavaria since spring 1800 during the Second coalition war with Austria .
Napoleon wanted a overview of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographic survey of Bavaria in order - of course for military purposes .
even if the French troops moved to Lun@@ é@@ ville from February 9 , 1801 , they were the present neigh@@ bors who created the idea of a surface area of Bavaria @-@ card .
Kur@@ für@@ st Max IV . Joseph drove the project further , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bavarian survey@@ ing administration .
the document for Munich dates back to 1856 and is like all others at the Bavarian State Library .
the comparison early / Today is in the example of the state capital at the most impressive .
the city has expanded into all directions and has grown together .
one example is sub@@ missions that is still isolated in the map of 1856 in the map .
S@@ end@@ ling was founded 21 years after the creation of the card , i.e. 1877 , in Munich .
today Unter@@ send@@ ling is located in the middle of the city .
the houses sub@@ missions are located around 1856 along the Pl@@ ing@@ ans@@ erst@@ raße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ ans@@ er , a leader of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where the West@@ park is , you can see nothing as a fields - at first glance : when it appears on a smaller map with d@@ utz@@ ing lines and numbers : handwritten entries from the so @-@ called &quot; Ur@@ intake &quot; which was derived from the basic tax .
there are no farmers in the land there today no farmers - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; land in the sun . &quot;
a large green area distingu@@ ishes north of Unter@@ send@@ ling .
the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 1810 , was in the position of the Oktober@@ fest , was actually a meadow - and no concrete desert .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the Ur@@ b@@ ons@@ leaf@@ let , in the field of today &apos;s au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen district , not only the street name &quot; at the host &quot; or from the height &quot; on the fan &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; w@@ ander . &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ Field Road there were once people with honey@@ s .
there was in 1858 / 59 the Munich circle @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; was created at the Au@@ er fan . &quot;
in 1872 Dr. Bernhard von G@@ ud@@ den managed the institution - the psychiat@@ rist who brought to the death of King Ludwig II in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was advanced for its time and finished for example , to w@@ ander the so @-@ called . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , he has led the personnel to apply violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , Head of the Museum Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who employs an exhibition with the an@@ st@@ alt .
for 280 patients there was first place , later it was extended to 500 places .
sometimes this capacity did not include this capacity - the reason for the construction of the Kreis@@ spar@@ kling wine in the hair of 1905 .
since 2006 the Is@@ ar @-@ A@@ MP@@ ER @-@ Klin@@ ikum Munich @-@ Ost is one of the largest psychiat@@ rist@@ les in Germany since 2006 .
at the age of the former Au@@ er An@@ st@@ alt , young people meet in Munich Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and walked in a youth home with training .
west is the football field of the TS@@ V Munich East , east residential houses from the 1980s .
in 2015 , one built the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; - in architectural re@@ jection to the original building of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt , which was destroyed during the Second World War .
the Marien@@ platz was listed as &quot; Head Square &quot; in 1856 , the department store called &quot; Kauf@@ inger street . &quot;
a decisive change brought the Second World War also in the heart of the mouth .
the allies of the Al@@ lies took many holes to the city centre in December 1944 .
a big continued until today - at Mari@@ enhof .
the English Institute , small business houses and a Gru@@ ft@@ kap@@ elle from the Middle Ages were once again at Mari@@ enhof , where these days will work on April 5 , 2017 on the ground@@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn line .
the old Munich @-@ map with the aerial photograph can be seen today with the aerial view of today - and the hole at Mari@@ enhof .
civil rights published rice @-@ drying for Missouri
the National Association for Promot@@ ing Colour has issued a warning for colour people who travel to the dis@@ crimin@@ ating policy and the ra@@ cial attacks of the state to Missouri .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri , which is to enter into force until August 28 , 2017 , calls for af@@ ro @-@ American trav@@ ellers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans , as a series of frag@@ ile , re@@ conn@@ aissance inci@@ dents in the entire country , and can be noted here , &quot; it is written in the opinion of the group .
a recently passed law of Missouri that it might make people serious , discrimination against discrimination , as well as the prosec@@ utions of the state , which aim to qu@@ eu@@ e to min@@ orities , ad@@ mitt@@ edly the group to release trav@@ ellers , said the NA@@ AC@@ P .
&quot; you have injuries of the civil rights that happen people .
they are incub@@ ated because of their skin colour , they are defeated or killed , &quot; said the President of the Missouri NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , the Kansas City Star .
&quot; we listen complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard . &quot;
it is the first such warning that the organization has been issued for a state in the US .
the group cited inci@@ dents like ra@@ cial insur@@ rection against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee .
S@@ anders died under frag@@ ile circumstances at the beginning of the year , after having taken no petrol during the journey through the state of Missouri , and was charged by the police in custody without a crime .
the Council also shows a recent report of the Office of the General At@@ tor@@ ney General of Missouri in which black drivers will be more common in the state 75 percent more than white .
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware of people and their families , friends and employees what could happen in Missouri , &quot; said Chapel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must be ready to bring whether there are Kau@@ ts@@ money or the relatives that they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2015 , Missouri recorded 100 Hass@@ elt , according to the latest figures from the Hass@@ elt I report of the FB@@ I , who entered the state in relation to the number of such injuries to the 16th rank of the country .
the travel time is also a response to a new Missouri Act that would be difficult to acc@@ use a company because of residence or employment discrimination .
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) had published travel regulations for Texas and Arizona , after the states of immig@@ ration authorities to susp@@ end people to susp@@ ects people for immig@@ ration to further rein@@ forcement authorities .
travel regulations are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , but during the last time , stak@@ eholder groups have used the measure as reaction to certain laws and trends in the United States .
electric fence project is Elem@@ ental
the Fisch@@ dez@@ au@@ n project is a successful project and will continue in the next year .
the CDU of the German Bundestag ordered Peter White and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac have a painting in front of the place .
at the court excav@@ ation of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family , representatives of the CDU city council met together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members .
Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann granted first in@@ sights into its operation , where he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 milk kiss@@ es and also many young animals and houses in five apartments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schwar@@ zw@@ al@@ d@@ milk &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is intended for him of the alternative advertising market for the milk of his cows , and Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the table of the Feri@@ h@@ uts come exclusively regional .
since he is also important as the BL@@ HV @-@ Chairman of Fisch@@ her@@ ach , he called the electric fence as a &quot; Elem@@ ental project . &quot;
I can non @-@ profit on der@@ art steep areas .
green past@@ oral care for much work , much must be processed with the motor sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have here with the conditions and the top@@ ography &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; emphas@@ ized Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 , he took over the elev@@ enth operation and acquired this without chemical plant protection and fertilizer , even if he do not lead bio@@ operations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commune has recognized the meaning of the consec@@ u@@ ity projects and is glad through the leader funding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare , the farmers would have to be supported .
it is hop@@ ed that the view of the surfaces could be pulled out for a whole while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have , are people who work in agriculture and thought about how they continue to bring their operation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the farmers are often involved in criticism
a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013 .
the dis@@ closure surface is thus 40 hectares , which can not be stopped until at least 2023 .
of the total cost of 71 500 Euros , half of the leader was funded by leader , a quarter wore the community of Fisch@@ her@@ ach .
in this way , the farmers had to invest 12 610 euros , which they had to invest in 16,@@ 2 kilometers of electric fence .
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; declared Schwen@@ de@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do not make a good job , without farmers , and land vir@@ gins . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also for Peter White : &quot; here the best food is produced . &quot;
the State Court ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg , the State Promotion of Wei@@ de@@ ceased .
the goal is the re@@ tention of the Black Forest .
pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ ite is the presence of one of the L@@ PR convey@@ ors .
Moreover , it must not be a tough area of waste management ( hang@@ b@@ ital above 35 percent ) and must be threatened by the collection .
for the 2018 Fisch@@ fence project 2018 , the application of eight participants are currently running 24 plots , which would like to build almost 16 kilometres fence .
the dis@@ closure area corresponds to 35 hectares , the calendar costs are more than 112 000 Euro .
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump is now taking the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est character of a regime change is if they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans estimate this as well as any other - therefore the fall @-@ staged Saddam H@@ uss@@ one on the Fir@@ dos square in Bagh@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump regime , knew what he did when he was a symbolic Ax@@ t in a heat dispute with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CN@@ N on the proposals of the dra@@ stic immig@@ ration to the Statue of Liberty .
to stay fair , Miller didn &apos;t handle the statue himself .
a hor@@ de of bo@@ ilers and Liberty Im@@ it@@ ators have suffered him , if he had done it .
but in particular , he took their significance , and in particular the importance that her was attributed to the famous po@@ em by Emma Lazarus , 17 years after the completion of the monument , its base was added .
when Miller A@@ co@@ sta writes : &quot; I don &apos;t want to enter a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that ligh@@ tens the world .
the po@@ em , which was added later , was added later , and not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
Miller is obj@@ ectively right , but as he formulated himself , it &apos;s not really about history .
it goes around the contemporary reson@@ ance to the raised words of Lazarus , the only one in which a state not only invites any old immig@@ rants , but the p@@ oo@@ rest of the poor : &quot; your rub@@ b@@ ish , your poor , and your poor masses , which are going to bre@@ athe freely , / the end of your rich coasts . &quot;
there was never a time , in which the &quot; el@@ ating waste &quot; was better to see our screens better .
Miller was not involved in literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ um@@ ps USA .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural conflict : it is indeed a conflict around the importance of America .
Lazarus and her friends who had to place their words after their death in the base - did very well that they had a highly political action .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and amer@@ ican rep@@ ublic@@ ism , in an un@@ used classical style depic@@ ting the female bo@@ di@@ ment of freedom .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her po@@ em is the female figure no more abstract - it has a voice .
and she himself gives a different name : mother of Ex@@ il@@ ant .
the connection of the po@@ em with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist cou@@ p and a devastating attack on the American extra vis@@ m .
and just like Lazarus the meaning of the statue changed , people wanted to change the people from the right wing .
the great cry as Rush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argu@@ ed in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was paid , but rather an early neo @-@ conservative , who wants to bring the American flame into the re@@ mun@@ eration world : &quot; Lady Liberty continues .
it should carry the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch shall not shine the way into the United States . &quot;
quite unusual is lim@@ it@@ gh here on anything .
the meaning of the statue is quite and even a matter of perception of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus was in it to see how they were seen from the exhau@@ sted , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible trips on the Dec@@ ks of ships .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it goes on the true sense to see the world from perspective of people who seek refuge and improve your chance to improve their lives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her statue says to them the words of hope and the welcome that they must hear .
and that is of course not the perspective , the Miller and Tr@@ ump ever want to know .
their tor@@ ch shall not shine the way , but the hat@@ red that is their only source of power .
world Championship 2017 : Neil Black is Scottish members of the United Kingdom
Eil@@ id@@ h Do@@ yle remin@@ is@@ cent of a time when only two s@@ uss@@ ers belonged to the UK team .
the performance of the Athlet@@ ics of the United Kingdom , Neil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent of the world championship race &quot; will aff@@ ord a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which starts on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Scotland has developed something special &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the athlet@@ ics of the United Kingdom &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome you , and we try to understand and we will continue until we &apos;ll need to figure out &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and think that it has something to do with what they did .
the Scottish athletes think that it has something to do with what they did .
British Athlet@@ ics : it has something to do what they did .
and also with the type on the street corner .
whatever the combination of the circumstances is , absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are med@@ alli@@ ons , among them Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5.000 m route , while Eil@@ id@@ h Do@@ yle was elected by the team to team@@ work .
&quot; Eil@@ id@@ h is quite modest .
her surrender speech was incredible , &quot; says Black .
&quot; a series of athletes , whether they were Scottish or where they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motiv@@ ated .
the passion and the real feeling , the Eil@@ id@@ h was very natural , were great . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Commonwealth @-@ silver med@@ alli@@ sts who compete in their fifth world championships with the 400 @-@ m hur@@ d@@ les &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says that it is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that 16 Sch@@ otten in the British team are &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were in 1983 and 2015 .
the middle @-@ route Mu@@ ir leads on this road and has set five European records last year in the past year .
it will be able to participate in the 1.500 m and the 5,000 m runs .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , which runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ s@@ man who was looking for a great season to observe the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games .
Do@@ yle reminds me of their first world championships , when the only other Scot@@ s@@ man was in the team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell .
the trade capit@@ als says that they are &quot; enorm@@ ously proud of the fact that many of their coun@@ try@@ men did not only belong to the team , but in some cases the medals and the fin@@ als .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the special thing about team surrender to be found that she was chosen by the other members of the team , but to know that my team mates voted for me and have chosen me , making it something very special for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; obviously I &apos;m very proud of all the sc@@ orn that belong to the team .
it only shows how far we came .
and they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to go on Po@@ or .
what my speech relate to Chap@@ ters ?
yes , I think it went well .
I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation , since we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from it that we are back in the Olympic stadium .
I get a second chance to go there and compete , and it simply will be so a great atmosphere there without . &quot;
block from critics on Facebook : be@@ ats not for a public office , if you don &apos;t wear it from voters .
the Father of our country knew something of bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it took not long until the newspapers struck him for all those who struck him up to his political principles .
he sh@@ ain about the cr@@ iti@@ que , safe .
but he did not put his critics to silence .
because in 1783 Washington said : &quot; the speech can be taken away - and , sil@@ ly and silent , we will be guided as the sheep . &quot;
this brings me to Govern@@ or Larry H@@ og@@ an , who must work to be more like Washington .
H@@ og@@ ans employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union accused him early in the beginning of this week .
the staff of govern@@ ors dismissed the law@@ suit as fri@@ vol@@ , and the online comment was full of a return reaction with &quot; Na , &quot; and ? . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s only Facebook , &quot; said many people .
but it is important .
and it is especially important when it is a type like H@@ og@@ an .
this is a republi@@ can Govern@@ or in an overwhelming democratic state that is aston@@ ishing popular .
he has the second most successful consent of the nation &apos;s 50 govern@@ ors .
H@@ og@@ an is not a re@@ ac@@ tionary heat head .
he has shown a fixed hand in the leadership of his state and strict compliance with the principles .
he was also very sent to use Facebook as a primary means to connect to his voters and play back his ha@@ ar@@ less head to chemotherapy on his side .
therefore , the blocking of persons who come on the site of the govern@@ ors - which is a public forum , which will be officially referred to and by employees who will be paid with public tax dollars - un@@ necessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post Defense Minister Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse , he argu@@ ed the actions of the govern@@ ors and argu@@ ed that the comments of comments is nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it is too easy to use the image of wheels or water or water @-@ filled people that force online .
the post spoke with some of the actual people that were blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
and these are only real people who speak with their chosen guide : a teacher , a business@@ man and a priest , no tro@@ l@@ le .
they all said that their comments resp@@ ect@@ ful and not prof@@ essions .
the priest cited the Bible in his post and app@@ eals to H@@ og@@ ans of the Catholic faith .
attor@@ ney at Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not h@@ ass@@ y , but she asked for Hass@@ elt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt pol@@ ite that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to Hass@@ le and other current news , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote in the commentary box of the news &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Post &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know this idea if a number of people on the same topic , then it will be used by some more than a so @-@ called collective and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what the staff of the govern@@ ors as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other likely &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fac@@ ebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocks a critic or a negative comment .
it is a lot of cleaner than in previous time , if one had done the same thing that employees have been sent to collect newspapers with critical guides and to destroy and destroy them to silence .
but it just happens digitally .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public officials which is critic@@ ised that he has implic@@ it Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is accused of Twitter users suffering from Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question fell last week in Virginia .
the chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of Lou@@ dou@@ n County is the last act of A@@ liz@@ ée , according to US District Judge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when she named a voters from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky Govern@@ or Matt Before ( R ) also received a visit from AC@@ L@@ U because of his use on Facebook and Twitter .
this should not be so hard .
at the time , the time of the affordable por@@ tos had a similar effect as the Internet .
the number of newspapers spread between 1776 and 1800 between 1776 and 1800 .
and even Washington had an anonymous Tro@@ l@@ le at that time .
the people who signed the pseud@@ onym@@ s like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ us , &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius , &quot; and &quot; Por@@ ti@@ us , &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that make Washington decisions .
Pet@@ itions that critic@@ ized its position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and navigation with the United Kingdom critic@@ ized his ministry , according to the historical documents that were collected by the Online Pap@@ ers of George Washington Project .
but he was not brought to silence .
freedom of expression and dis@@ courses belong to the basis of our nation .
and true leadership means that to accept .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort at the Renaissance club
the former European Union No . 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope in the next three days in the next three days , since the Renaissance Club in East Mun@@ ian organized the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that feels really special , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said this in South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I did not defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura Open , since it was in the year after I had won them out of the program .
back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories came back from the last year , and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon , last year here .
it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate . &quot;
Gary OR@@ R , who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50th birthday , returns to its home market back to his 50th birthday .
this event will be the first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is always a bit more if you play at home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said OR@@ R , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you want to make it good , but you will also feel these additional pressure .
I really enjoyed it again and I played a solid golf .
I &apos;m glad about how it has gone . &quot;

less lung disease due to passive smoke
in the past two decades less people are extinct for liabilities of lung cancer .
scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) will come to this result .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 167 lung cancer fail@@ ures are due to liabilities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said study of Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in comparison , he moved to his own study on this topic in 1994 .
at that time there was still 400 lung disease due to passive har@@ sh per year in Germany .
the new investigation is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
household connections are considered very complex
the construction work in the Vill@@ inger Street are in full swing and they are reas@@ onably reas@@ onably in the time , so the head of the construction station Fred Hein@@ ze .
in the area of house connections , the situation is more complicated than suspected because in the background a lot of amounts , which is not specified in the plans .
the traffic , which is always handic@@ apped to work on construction , represents a great problem for the construction site of St@@ ump@@ p company .
&quot; the Ig@@ nor@@ anz of motor@@ ists in front of red lights and shut down is enormous , &quot; reported Hein@@ ze .
the road is locked and only the liner buses are eligible for passage .
Angelo Car@@ uso , Marvin Kost@@ or@@ z and Tim cost@@ ume from the company St@@ ump@@ p has been working on the bridge since weeks .

when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i had the dinner , they don &apos;t use stove .
it even uses only rarely a pot .

poly@@ gam@@ ie is common here .
of course you can work too late : most village men are unemployed , and many drink heavy , and there are soldiers .
&quot; no one knows , after 17 o &apos;clock in the village , she says .
it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was taken in 1969 after a controversi@@ al referendum in Indonesia , when only 1.0@@ 26 elderly people should vote before the occupying troops .
an existing movement that touched the Dutch rule against the Dutch rule , turned quickly against the government of Jakarta , which includes control of the region and foreign journalists or legal notice of them .
in 2003 the province was officially split into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , with the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea as the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as follows as a desert . the journey includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the province capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a moral 5 @-@ hour drive with the car rental .
there is no public transport .
the city with approximately 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses , surrounded by bam@@ bo@@ o hill , and of corrugated ro@@ ofs , which were converted by rust in different gel@@ b@@ brown tones .
only very few gu@@ ards have made their journey here , because journalists and practically no fore@@ igner .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not used to bear these clothing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and indicates her lively , handmade tur@@ ban , her dar@@ ker shirts and their bright rock . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Pap@@ ua is in@@ don@@ esi@@ enstadt province , where 28 % of people live under the poverty line and some of the worst child mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also In@@ don@@ esi@@ ens Gold@@ land .
the largest and profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located just 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ lands in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort valued at 3.1 billion US dollars gold and copper alone .
in addition , Pap@@ ua has a value of estimated 78 billion US dollars .
however , these riches are a source of mis@@ ery for the Pap@@ ua , which ensure that in@@ don@@ esi@@ ze powerful military preserv@@ es a fir@@ ing presence .
an investigation of 2005 reported in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort Local Mil@@ ky and units paid almost 20 million US dollars , including up to 150,000 US dollars at a single officer .
according to greater autonomy , Pap@@ u@@ ic demands threat@@ ens these golden go@@ ose and are gn@@ ashed out .
according to activists , more than 500,000 Pap@@ ua have been killed and thousands were ra@@ ped by the Indonesian military since 1969 , tor@@ tured and imprisoned .

in the region alone , the Indonesian Police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators in the last year alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in a report of the arch@@ dioc@@ ese Brisbane from the year 2016 , in which reports about atro@@ cities of the previous year are included , such as un@@ legal exec@@ utions and torture - rape and power attacks are particularly popular according to another report - and the brutal precip@@ itation of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims that happen every week , Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch .
the screws have strengthened , since Pap@@ u@@ as resources have a state of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but the demo@@ graphic development has changed , since Muslim economic migrants come from the most populated islands Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra , and Sul@@ aw@@ esi .

&quot; it has been the native Pap@@ ua - the Mama @-@ Mama &#91; the women &#93; of Pap@@ ua - their market . &quot;
the Indonesian President J@@ oko Wi@@ do@@ do , known in folk and as Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised the ine@@ qualities and infr@@ in@@ gement in Pap@@ ua during his election campaign in 2014 .
the former Zimmermann secured 27 out of 29 districts of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential Palace in Jakarta .
but in Pap@@ ua has changed little , and today they feel the loc@@ als .
&quot; our hearts are broken because we have voted for j@@ ow@@ i , with the expect@@ ation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; says You .
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered only two months after Jok@@ ow &apos;s inauguration in October .
on 7 December 2014 , there was a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two in@@ dones@@ ian soldiers broke out on a motorcycle through the darkness .
they created the dry children to them that they should turn their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers took part in their sound and later returned to four soldiers , so the local past@@ or Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk drunk , pursued the group with their ri@@ bs , told victims and witnesses .
then , one of the soldiers fired up into the group of children .
a child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ eim@@ o , was so severely beaten that he fell into a coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and the things going on the next day .
about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua Men , women and children gathered themselves on a football pitch in front of the local police station and the military commander to demand justice .
they carried the Jag@@ db@@ ye and led the Wa@@ ita @-@ Dance - in the circle and a bird @-@ sigh@@ ting - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago Stamm .
some demonstr@@ ators began to cast stones on police and military posts .
when the tuning was heated , the soldier was sent to a command via an internal radio : &quot; if the masses have more than three times , they shoot her dead , &quot; says it in an official document of TI@@ ME , which was not released for local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the leader of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ quarter of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the dro@@ pl@@ ating danger and called to peace and called the amount to return home .
no one was listening to the mood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I turned back to my left hand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the porch of his colorful wooden house &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
k@@ ay@@ ame knows not yet , who has fired , but says that the ball out of the rows were gathered together .
&quot; it was crow@@ ded , many shots were fired , &quot; add it .
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was taken three times , so his c@@ ousin , the witness of vom@@ iting was .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I joined to him and instructed his body to make sure it was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ oh@@ anes , who only carries a name , the TI@@ ME in dark mood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I have kissed him . &quot;
the editor of the Pap@@ ua Police , Y@@ ot@@ je M@@ ende , said repor@@ ters that his officers wanted to secure their station only &quot; because they will be attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves if people threatened to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua Police , Commissioner Pud@@ jo Su@@ li@@ sti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others were injured .
the messages about the T@@ öt@@ ations arrived only on the following day &quot; filtered by Jakarta .
in three weeks Jok@@ ow@@ i held a passionate speech in Jay@@ ap@@ ura , in which he expressed sympath@@ ies for the families of the victims and s@@ ware to tackle the historical abuse of Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like that this case is immediately solved so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
security minister Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 that he has an extra@@ judicial mechanism to set out historical human rights violations .
but the talk started almost immediately .
&quot; most injuries occurred before a long time .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 years .
the point is that we are obliged to tackle these violations , but there are processes that have to run through . &quot; he said .
then , Wir@@ anto made a retreat when he spoke at the end of June in Jakarta with TI@@ ME , and said he had no plans to set a complaint in Pap@@ ua a complaint mechanism .
instead , &quot; everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Wir@@ anto who accused the UN for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indicted more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or bloody independence of independence from 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Pap@@ ua had already been buried , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot; &quot; &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims took such claims with gri@@ mm@@ ing un@@ beli@@ ever .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes .
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that he still lives in anxi@@ ety years later .
&quot; I have fear , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was afraid to be arrested by the military , fear , and shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people in pan@@ i@@ ai was afraid to discuss the incident .
he says that he was defeated by the military after he helped four of the victims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after I was buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military sought to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says he . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sl@@ ats have not heard .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police lied on the vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
during a con@@ front@@ ation between the vill@@ agers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma that refused to bring a conscious man to the hospital , died a person and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , who was 24 @-@ year old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was dr@@ unken with a nearby river , died on the way into the hospital .
the vill@@ agers protests against the company &apos;s office in front of the company .
the police said that the vill@@ agers had cast stones to officers who re@@ acted on it by dra@@ fted warning .
but in@@ native that the mobile Brigade ( Indonesian par@@ amil@@ itary police ) began to shoot and killed one .
&quot; we were so in pan@@ ic , we have fear that there will be ven@@ geance , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u B@@ adi@@ i , who lives and witness to the hospital , as the last one has been delivered quickly , so the TI@@ ME .
&quot; I hidden two days in my house . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai Parliament called to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai Parliament &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to withdraw officers from the territory to withdraw from the territory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always an accident in the Indonesian government .
the lack of sen@@ sible development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the family members Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and Dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua .
many included in the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , who claims to defend the rights of Pap@@ ua by using spor@@ adic attacks and demonstrations by Indonesian soldiers .
some of the top @-@ O@@ PM leaders origin@@ ate from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including T@@ adi@@ us Y@@ og@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ oya .
in response to the last few years , thousands of people were arrested in Pan@@ i@@ ai and arbitr@@ arily arrested in custody under the pre@@ text of the national sover@@ eig@@ n@@ ty . &quot;
some diving never again .
among the people in Pap@@ ua is Pan@@ i@@ ai , a tragic place called &quot; a tragic place . &quot;
poverty strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice that is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is to be expensive for home .
bread is just as range .
people living here for everything they eat : especially Not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of swe@@ eten@@ ers each .
they keep the majority of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces Not@@ a tast@@ ed only 10,000 in@@ dones@@ ian Rup@@ ia ( 75 C@@ ents ) .
in the course of time , economic ine@@ qualities have grown between the native Pap@@ ua and the new migrants who have arrived Nab@@ ire in larger numbers since the opening of new Airlines .
the few jobs , which are in the region , usually go to the better educ@@ ated and we@@ al@@ ous migrants .
Pap@@ ua have rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to perform their own company competitive .
&quot; the young people are not interested in to stay in the village ... because there is no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , Chair@@ woman of the Chief of Pan@@ i@@ ai .
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
in addition , limitations of coverage international media is e@@ ager@@ ly ten@@ sion@@ ed .
at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ das and Bas@@ ille Long@@ ch@@ amp were deported for lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although the rare permission was given to them .
according to Ph@@ el@@ im K@@ ine , the deputy Asia @-@ Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of j@@ ow@@ is election campaign , to raise the restrictions of coverage to promote transparency and development , not realized .
&quot; there are new d@@ angers for foreign journalists , trying to report of in@@ don@@ esi@@ ze in@@ quiet provinces of Pap@@ ua and West@@ pap@@ ua : visa @-@ ref@@ usal and a black list , he said in a statement .
lack press control means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely limited to the immediate neigh@@ bors of Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March called six pairs of Pacific states - Tong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Mar@@ sh@@ all@@ ots and the Salom@@ ons Islands - the UN Human Rights Council on which &quot; various and widespread injuries &quot; in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting .
the same countries have historically seen the O@@ PM .
the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Ministry of Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha Nas@@ ir proved the alleg@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jakarta : &quot; in Indonesia it is still a democratic system , and there are free media , so it is difficult to understand the evidence of human rights cases . &quot;
people want to consider that more foreign governments should take this .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of the Human Rights ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura broke out in silence , and op@@ pressed him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that participated in the meeting , but anonymous .
in 2019 , Indonesia will say a further presidential election , but the Pap@@ ua say that they probably don &apos;t want to vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i .
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good views , but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , Chair@@ woman of the Chief Council .
he wants to know that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from which it lives under the constant threat of a burn military , is in poor education and health services .
Gob@@ i says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , her voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; gu@@ ilt &quot; that he must pay back .
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they want only justice , &quot; he says .
despite the thre@@ ats and en@@ ig@@ ations , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ Sch@@ uss@@ ur carried out a recent symbolic act of the Trot@@ sky@@ scra@@ per : the Lei@@ che of a sacrifice was buried on a site exactly opposite the police and the military station .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They know that perhaps never will never come righteousness , but at least they shall not forget her crime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with her head .
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; Wol@@ k@@ enk@@ rat@@ zer from Dubai to the second time
a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest residential towers in Dubai in Dubai , and forced hundreds of inhabitants , dating back to 337 meters high , 79 @-@ story buildings .
it is the second fire that passes through the sky@@ scra@@ per in just two years , which is called by the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) .
the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; we slept and we have stood at the fire alarm and at the cry of the people .
we took down the stairs down , and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50th floor to the bottom , the residents told his name as George ang@@ ab , Reuters .
Dub@@ ais civil defence claims that the units of fire fighting against 4.00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 p.m. GMT ) the fire extingu@@ ished and the building .
the government said that they work on the provision of accommodation for the person concerned .
the incident can be used to safety of materials which are used in outdoor areas of high farms around the world , revi@@ ve .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that the largest part of damage from the clothing , the outer covering for decoration or insulation .
in Great Britain the police said they believe that the system of plates for insulation and clothing to the London @-@ coat tower in June to the rapid spread of a sector contributed to which about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International Tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) has fallen by his big Davis Cup Cou@@ p at the General Meeting .
at the meeting in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , this sport @-@ revolutionary suggest@@ ion was supported for this sport @-@ revolutionary suggest@@ ion , Davis @-@ Cup singles , but not only supported on two winners , skin @-@ thin but not required by the required two @-@ third majority .
although often very long , but also very estimated five @-@ set classi@@ cs remain the traditional competition .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 percent of affili@@ ates voted for reform , the goal of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty , therefore only barely missed .
&quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup .
we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these i@@ kon@@ ic and historical competitions , &quot; Hag@@ ger@@ ty said .
you will continue to work to improve the applic@@ ants .
even for the vote , after many influences , the proposal had come to apply the final on a neutral place .
new from 2018 only compar@@ atively smaller details : the fin@@ alists will have the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup in the first round in the first round .
in order to reduce the costs for the organis@@ ers , the requirements are facilit@@ ated in terms of training places , and players will need to be less official media events before the Davis Cup .
more than 1 out of 5 US trav@@ ellers brings together items to the aircraft , finds a survey
a survey conducted under flight pass@@ ers revealed that more than 20 percent are aware or un@@ aware items to the control points of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent , which took the plane while they acci@@ dentally carried out knives or other objects with blades .
less than 1 percent claimed that they would have been detected late that they were ir@@ cl@@ ed with fire@@ arms , am@@ mun@@ ition , or explo@@ si@@ ves .
the survey carried out more than 1,000 people - provided by a jet charter service , the Strat@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , was carried out - also noted that younger trav@@ ellers are rather mis@@ ated the rules .
of those surveyed said they have tried to fly with something that was banned by the T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 percent Mill@@ enni@@ als were compared to less than 15 percent , the members of Generation X .
the most common articles that were abor@@ ted on T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
more than 3 percent said to have applied objects with blades through security control , while 2.2 percent of female respon@@ dents and 3.7 percent of male respon@@ dents have confirmed that they would be able to susp@@ ect drugs into the plane .
the company said , there were trav@@ ellers interested in all the country to find out how many acci@@ dentally Schm@@ ug@@ gel@@ ware would have been brought out through the airport safety and how many it had been explicitly mentioned .
it &apos;s not a surprise that people who use the most likely sm@@ ug@@ g@@ ware - ignor@@ ant or ignor@@ ant - due to safety , those were the most frequently used .
however , the company indicates that the T@@ SA directives have a bit complicated and conf@@ using .
people often are uns@@ af@@ e , which may not take them or how much of them .
so it is no surprise that the largest quantity of the T@@ SA ut@@ ili@@ ze items are forbidden .
a period of time thought about T@@ SA could watch books as Schm@@ ug@@ gel@@ ware .
liquids are allowed upon domestic trips , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t matter : tens of thousands of Tesla @-@ customers
electro @-@ thous@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k gives you the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tesla &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
so far , he did so far , that a part of the customer has already withdrawn its non @-@ sale reservation .
in addition to the always triumph@@ ant figures , Tesla boss El@@ on Mus@@ k has announced another , less gl@@ itter@@ ing number for the first time , with the announcement of the latest quarterly balance : the cancellations made during the new mass market @-@ model 3 .
Mus@@ k had frequently used more than 500,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car in the past months , whose delivery is just starting .
now , Mus@@ k , a total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders , 63@@ .000 has already been withdrawn .
critics had always pointed out that it is just for sale reservations .
with a cancellation you will pay the 1000 Euro ( in the US $ 1000 ) and the United Kingdom of 1000 pounds ) &quot; Reserv@@ ed payment . &quot;
at present , 45@@ 5,000 currently al@@ ert such a telephone conference , dre@@ aming Mus@@ k in a telephone conference with an@@ alysts .
that the cancellation of so far has around twelve percent of all orders to be problem , but the Tesla boss doesn &apos;t believe .
his argument : the challenge for ambitious growth targets is not on demand , but on the production site .
last year , Tesla delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
by 2018 it shall be taken together - all models - 500,000 , 2020 a million .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k there are currently 1800 reservations per day .
who today ordered a &quot; Model 3 &quot; in the second half of 2018 with the delivery - when Tesla creates it , its n@@ ag@@ el@@ new , never in practice tested the production roads without major interrup@@ tions with maximum extent of utilization .
many experts doub@@ ts that this is possible .
but it comes to greater del@@ ays , then the in@@ feed for reservations may be solved for Tesla .
for then , the company cannot aff@@ ecting the company un@@ satisfied customers , in dro@@ ves d@@ av@@ on@@ zul@@ u .
EPA Chef P@@ ru@@ itt is moving forward because of the execution of the rules of the Obama Er@@ a to reduce emissions
one day after he had been accused of 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the Chief of the Environment Protection Authority , his former decision returned to reduce the rules of the Obama era to reduce emissions of smo@@ g @-@ related air pollutants .
P@@ ru@@ itt proved the change , when his agency proved to meet the needs of state environmental authorities to re@@ act faster than previous devast@@ ated .
he did not mention the complaint against his previous site in a Federal Court of Appeals .
it is about a deadline that ran on October 1 for States to hold the standards of 2015 for under@@ floor of ozone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt said in June that he would have to put the compliance with a year to study more time to study the plan and to avoid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; local decisions or economic growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was in front of his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump prosec@@ utor of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , was a long time a reliable opponent for environmental protection regulations .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt is repe@@ ating to block or fail@@ ures to block the chemical industry and industry of fossil fuels .
the sudden change of Wednesday is the youngest legal re@@ sign@@ ment for the Rwand@@ an regulatory Roll@@ back agenda .
last month , a Federal Constitutional Court in Washington decided that the EPA direct @-@ wal@@ ker has exceeded its authority as he tried to safegu@@ ard the implementation of the Obama administration , the oil and gas company to monitor the monitoring and reduction of methane le@@ cks .
in a hearing on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt proved that his K@@ ehr@@ l turn in ozone @-@ standards quite simply the read@@ iness of the EPA for cooperation with the states through the complex process of maintaining the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under former devast@@ ation , the EPA often has not maintained the dead@@ lines for the implementation of activ@@ ating agents and others , and in an agreement the date for the implementation of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who accused EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in a regulation through trial procedures , and we accept dead@@ lines .
we also take the law and authority that gives us , seriously . &quot;
nevertheless , the opinion of EPA reported that P@@ ru@@ itt was able to make sure its &quot; desire to delay and all other trade@@ marks are made available to ensure that the regulations are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot;
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in congress can be found on a comprehensive reconstruction of the ozone rules .
one of the last month of approval bill , the implementation of the 2015 rules shall be delayed by at least eight years .
the measure was not yet made to vote in the Senate .
the New York General At@@ tor@@ ney , Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the Coalition of the States , who promised the EPA in this week , said the group intended to justi@@ fy the statutory pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the return of the EPA - according to our complaints - is an important profit for health and safety of these 6.7 million new Yor@@ kers and over 115 million Americans who are affected directly from smo@@ g who flows into their congregations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this case California , Connecticut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penns@@ , New Mexico , Oregon , Penns@@ and Washington and the District of Columbia .
ground @-@ ozone arises when pollutants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemicals plants and other sources in the atmosphere respond to sunlight .
the smo@@ g smo@@ g can cause serious respiratory problems and contribute to thousands of premature death cases each year .
representatives of the public health industry and environmental protective covers over P@@ ru@@ des surprising course change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is wor@@ ried about how much pressure needs to get this sen@@ sible step by the responsible person responsible for the protection of the air that we bre@@ athe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d vom Center for Bi@@ ological Diversity . &quot; &quot; &quot;

club wants to check authorization of Win@@ dr@@ ences
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sees no legal requirement for the construction and has therefore turned aside to the land rat . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CDU ) is asked to withdraw his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ eimer N@@ ette .
it is illegal .
the association argu@@ ed that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in Bo@@ ish@@ eimer N@@ ette , no wind turbines could have been approved , because at the time it exists only at the city limit to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal a wind force concentration zone .
within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , at the same time causes a concentration of wind energy use for the rest of the city area .
such zones should prevent a &quot; saving &quot; of the landscape .
a few days before@@ hand had a second wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ eimer N@@ ette - but the District Government of Düsseldorf was not approved because of a form@@ att@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planning , the approved approval of approval according to illegal and therefore , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Erk@@ ens , Chairman of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the current state of things : the city council once again decided in front of the summer break again the wind concentration zone in Bo@@ ish@@ eimer N@@ ette ; a approval of the District government is still out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; note : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the creation of an approval for the construction of wind turbines planned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the collection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the relevant writing have been received during the last week of circle Vier@@ sen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared a speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes them to check the matter again .
but they do not expect that the procedure will be stopped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with a view of the ongoing proceedings at the Administ@@ rative Court , the circle on Thursday was not responsible for the arguments of the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the NEW Re , a subsidiary of NEW , is planning on an area at the Bo@@ ish@@ eimer N@@ ette the construction of four each 200 meters high win@@ ders .
the company had already been involved in the past year , which is involved in the town of Vier@@ sen @-@ bar , comm@@ it@@ ments with the owner of about 65 hectares .
with the construction of four wind turbines , the power requirement of around 11 400 households can be covered - this equ@@ ates to approximately one fifth of the current needs of all four thousand households .
the NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
in the past summer , Vier@@ sens Stad@@ entered green light for the purchase of three wind turbines at the wind park Lin@@ ni@@ ch near Aachen and a participation in wind energy plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in Hein@@ sberg .

tr@@ ump set after continuous tran@@ scription of telephone call in Mexico under pressure due to payment of the border wall
tran@@ scripts of telephone call between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and Dri@@ vers of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
on 27 January , Tr@@ ump in a telephone at the Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto on the request that he would not pay for a planned bound@@ ary wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the US President im@@ presses him because he had publicly challenged the wall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t say the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump started its presidential campaign with the promise to establish a wall in the southern border of the United States , and s@@ ware , Mexico for the project .
tran@@ scription of his first An@@ ru@@ fs with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ hout were also published and un@@ sealed an an@@ amped exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. W@@ ump said that a trade for the U.S. refugees emigrated to Australia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; stup@@ id , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that the existence was medi@@ ated by the Obama administration , he would like to look like a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after he had proposed a ban on the re@@ location of refugees in the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Moo@@ res Ford massacre : activists lead r@@ ra@@ cial Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice again
a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mercury went through a group of viewers in rural Monroe , Georgia , and r@@ ump@@ ed to the Ford Bridge of Moore .
before the car , the four black passengers and a white driver had reached the bridge , a group of white men came out to block his way .
the leader of the Mo@@ bs - a man middle age in a needle strike - took a long train to his cig@@ ar and looked at the wind@@ shield .
inside the occup@@ ants in fear .
&quot; we want this n -@@ --- r Roger ! &quot; ro@@ aring the man . &quot;
&quot; get it from the car ! &quot;
cri@@ es out the silence , when a young black man was torn down from the passenger seat .
fortunately , this terrible scene , which was played on July 22 , was only a post@@ age .
but when a ch@@ uck is thrown by the neck of &quot; Roger &quot; , almost all of them were very genuine epi@@ demic .
since 2005 he has been back to Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night , in the two black pairs - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com , as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - by K@@ u Kl@@ ux Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one was indicted for murder because of the mor@@ de .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is really impossible that we had not been arrested in all these years - although we see it in our congregations , although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks , who helps you to the organization of the post@@ age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a dirt spot in a story but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bro@@ oks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former congress of Georgia and a life of civil rights .
it serves as a dramatic call for him as a dramatic call to hand and represents an annual reminder of the Monroe community that an iniquity was never corrected .
&quot; we want to be prosec@@ utions , we want to be the termination , we want to receive reconciliation , but first we must receive justice , &quot; he said .
&quot; we cannot get to healing and reconciliation until we receive justice . &quot;
a court @-@ medi@@ ator lays a bed cloth on the bodies of one of the victims of the Moore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ n on July 27 , 1946 .
according to FB@@ I files that were obtained from N@@ BC News , more than 50 men were suspected of Monroe and the surrounding coun@@ ties in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process .
but nobody was ever indicted .
although the susp@@ ects remain on the free foot , Citi@@ zenship , that the double motivation for Lyn@@ ch actions are always known throughout the city : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision of the Supreme Court found the black citizens in Georgia to vote for the first time in the summer .
about at the same time as the election st@@ ach according to the FB@@ I of the black Far@@ mp@@ ter Roger Mal@@ com a white basic owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a struggle - allegedly because of a woman .
Bro@@ oks said that the rum@@ oured in the city was that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy I and that the baby , which she took her , did not escape from her husband .
on July 25 , 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white park @-@ owner , 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , so the FB@@ I .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and their cou@@ sins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
but when she moved away from prison , the Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge drew near a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b the car .
&quot; as it looked out , it was Har@@ rison that has prepared the mor@@ de and arranged &quot; it includes a FB@@ I report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is obvious that there was a con@@ spi@@ racy between the state and local prosecution that was not only involved in the murder , evidence of evidence and the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bro@@ oks formul@@ ates it even more fun .
&quot; it was a election law , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you register and vote , then you will happen here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cass@@ and@@ ra Gre@@ ens has led the annual report of the Moore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their representation is amazing , moving and is justified in a kind of deep rac@@ ism that we would like to believe in America no longer exists .
it is difficult to look and even more difficult , but Gre@@ ene said that the point is .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ chen because we will be con@@ fron@@ ted with its h@@ äss@@ ality in us , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I can &apos;t work any relationship to you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I have done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rehear@@ s@@ als for the year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest black - in a room and lu@@ ent as Gre@@ ene played a well @-@ played overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ ens Co @-@ director .
he has played the role of the boss C@@ lan@@ mit@@ gli@@ des since years , but he said that the role will never be easier .
&quot; I feel dirty , because I &apos;m not so , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to get this story on life because we would not want to return to this time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room tried the actor D@@ arri@@ us Brad@@ sh@@ aw and Nick Ras@@ cona , the Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester play their lines .
the piece starts with Mal@@ com , the h@@ ester an@@ cho@@ ke and op@@ pressed him that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , n --- he , swal@@ low up my possession ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ras@@ cona answer the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all the black actor ) breaks off .
Gre@@ ens laugh@@ s at the end .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; asked shaving .
he is al@@ arm@@ ed and conf@@ used .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still k@@ ich@@ ever .
&quot; I just don &apos;t think that white people at that time &apos; n --- &apos; have said . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; funny one of the other black hin@@ ders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you just need to meet the tough &apos; R. &apos; . &quot;
and precisely in the space , the energy in the space , a feeling of the camera , replaces the un@@ break@@ age .
everyone is busy to get this correctly , not only because of the game but also for the memory of the four killed people .
the scene starts once again .
this time , when Ras@@ cona says the N @-@ word , he says it sharp and with re@@ print .
absolutely no one laugh@@ s .
this repet@@ ition ends quickly and quickly .
there are cri@@ es , shots and then silence .
a woman , clothed with a sad@@ ness , stands above the bodies of the actors and leads cheap lo@@ bre@@ de &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot;
their voice breaks out in every second word .
approximately one hundred metres behind it is a group of about four dozen spectators swe@@ at and tears out of the eyes .
the audience is divided almost evenly between black and white .
a pair is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come down the street .
they all experiences about eight hours of Geor@@ gi@@ as pressing moisture when Bro@@ oks they lead on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point , the Mor@@ de remained an A@@ ne@@ c@@ ote , but now if you have found on the same country where Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de found themselves feel the air .
when the last score of the song , Gre@@ ens invites people to come closer and insp@@ ecting the body name .
kids ho@@ cken in their heads , register the counter@@ f@@ eit blood and the silent body and whis@@ per to each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mur@@ m@@ ute a little boy when he would remember it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after some minutes , Gre@@ ene of the amount - and suddenly there is over .
the actors throw the Lyn@@ x rope and w@@ ish their tears .
Brad@@ sh@@ aw um@@ ar@@ mt Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man who played the C@@ lan@@ der .
Nick Ras@@ cona um@@ bled two of his fellow players and breaks into their poor weeping , the emotional load of performance finally breaks out with him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whis@@ per@@ ed one of women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we know that this is not in your heart .
you have done this out of a reason . &quot;
later the audience of the actors joined together with the actors .
on a table pl@@ unge a white pair from Atlanta , passing a black pair , which they have just learned .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski fought for words to find words which left the performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is hard to hear these terrible words and works ... of people who look like yourself and do it , because they look like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what really do with me , let me believe that the Lyn@@ n is still going on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today it is called the police @-@ shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks farm keeps on his table , he eat and reminds on the civil rights .
he said he began to plan the performance in the next year .
&quot; the reproduction is inspir@@ ing in a way , because it describes the terror of what we have borne , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said .
&quot; it &apos;s so if we get nothing out of it , then it can happen again .
whoever does not study his own story , who doesn &apos;t know his own story is sentenced to repeat it . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ d@@ us@@ k &quot; reconc@@ ile the Wag@@ n@@ eri@@ an in Bayreuth
also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monum@@ ental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf has a colorful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ e production of gigantic , six @-@ storey Kul@@ isse .
the rotary platform ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) shows a fo@@ aming road corner with the Wall of the Wall Street and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pl@@ aste and El@@ sts &quot; logo from GDR @-@ times or the New York Stock Exchange .
before that time , an open Mercedes @-@ Old@@ timer , in which the Rh@@ enish missionary as Rock@@ erg@@ ir@@ ls , or alternatively a Is@@ etta .
stack@@ ed oil waters remin@@ is@@ cent of Cast@@ or@@ fs gui@@ ding - money , power and gi@@ er - which is moving through his &quot; ring &quot; st@@ aging .
the three Rh@@ enish missionary - sung by Steph@@ anie Hou@@ tz@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke L@@ ehm@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra Steiner - harmon@@ ize how already in &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; wonderful .
they run Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , tro@@ dden a Lei@@ che into the trunk in Hollywood man@@ ier and give the Kra@@ wall@@ o @-@ Cli@@ que .
Stephen M@@ illing s@@ ings the del@@ ight@@ ful Hagen , which gives the A@@ ura of a heavy weight box@@ ers .
brutal the scene when it strikes Siegfried .
later Gun@@ ther ( Markus Oak ) must also believe in favour .
the audience was giving thanks to the ensemble with strong appl@@ ause .
stor@@ my will be celebrated F@@ oster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski , which is a modest and hands to Merkel @-@ smo@@ ked hands .
there is a big appl@@ ause for the festival orchestra that shows itself on stage - in view of the big heat again in Leg@@ erer leisure clothes .
with exc@@ itement , the gig was expected by Frank Cast@@ orf and his regional team .
in 2013 , he had to leave a plane of the Pfei@@ ffer concert in 2013 , there were five years later , in which the &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; ru@@ fe went down .
Fest@@ spiel@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to have pleased about that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you notice that the audience has grown together with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it had said shortly before the performance of d@@ pa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audience did not only have a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it is also a understanding of its vision .
I go a positive conclusion .
max amount works as volunteers
they work at several locations in their volunte@@ er year .
where to everywhere ?
quantity : usually in Stein@@ furt in the furniture store , once a week I can help here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I have already worked at school on the open day .
how are your experiences yet ?
quantity : it is a beautiful , broad spectrum that I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years old so a late volunte@@ er .
how does that mean ?
quantity : I made high school .
and then a civil engineering studies , say , we have been successfully demolished .
I know that it is for me that the fal@@ sche is and I want to do something else with people .
and then I asked me , what do you do .
get a social year , there is an insight where you can see how it is on site , in the focal point maybe even , really is .
and was it so ?
amount : I collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the winter semester .
I will study dual , probably in the youth office Her@@ ne is a social worker of social education and education in Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences .
is it not unusual , during volunte@@ er service several different applications ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it is likely to be on where you make its FS@@ J .
it can make it possible from aging to youth - in all possible fac@@ ets of social work .
it was very varied in me .
I was also partly in the O@@ gs , so in the afternoon care .
for me , it was exactly the right that has been rolled out .
I could recognize my own strengths and see how it really runs .
differently than in civil engineering ?
amount : well , here it is not needed to calculate st@@ atics .
one has always had other people in the head , each have a different history behind them .
whether a refugee , whether a youth , who has been picked up from the family - one must always go on it .
very interesting .
and you had no touch @-@ related ?
quantity : I &apos;m not the guy .
it is a range that gives a lot .
much love , much kindness .
there are also negative moments , but so life is just life .
Pear@@ son cut another 3,000 jobs and cut the dividend to revi@@ ve the business
the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday , it will cut another 3,000 jobs and its interim dividend by 72 percent , as a further restructuring program will be started to overcome the pressure , with which the company is con@@ fron@@ ted .
the job reduction , the Director General John Fall@@ on predominantly for the end of 2018 and early 2019 , comes in addition to its previous restructuring , which had already lost 4,000 places .

con@@ voy attack by Kabul : NATO @-@ Sol@@ dat killed in suicide attack
a military con@@ voy has attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afghan capital of Kabul , killed a soldier of NATO and several others , say civil servants .
five soldiers and an interpre@@ ter have been injured , a declaration of NATO divided .
the local reports that died in the district of Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h also died three civilians .
the bombar@@ d@@ ment is the last violence that brought Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday , more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at .
on the Monday , a suicide bom@@ bers killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul .
in an opinion of Nato , it was to be done on Thursday night when a common pat@@ rol with the Afghan army attacked by a &quot; of people made impro@@ vised attack . &quot;
the statement say that all the last in a stable condition are located in the US military hospital on the air@@ field Bag@@ ram .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group that is known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h is a great concern for NATO troops near the nearby Bag@@ ram .
according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 million civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of which in the capital .
at the end of July , a suicide bom@@ b@@ ance of at least 30 people killed in a mainly Shi@@ ite district of Kabul .

EPA returns decision to delay the Smo@@ g Rule to Kl@@ agen
the US @-@ American Environmental Protection Agency has a decision to abol@@ ish a regulation of the government of Obama , taken out that the states are obliged to em@@ ulate the smo@@ g @-@ caused emissions . this was a day after 15 States accused the agency because of the stri@@ de .
the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to describe the so @-@ called &quot; Oz@@ on@@ regulations 2015 &quot; and said they show the obligation of the agency , with countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in the dialogue with and that we react to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA CEO Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in June , P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of EPA , which should be measured in a part of the country &apos;s pollut@@ ant emissions , to determine where the cuts must be made to have stric@@ ter air quality standards - to be delayed by a year until October 2018 .
a group of 15 largely democratic states , along with the District of Colombia , filed a complaint and told that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has attempted to impos@@ e a wide range of environmental issues , which the former President Barack Obama dis@@ covers , as part of a wider agenda that is to spur growth according to Tr@@ ump &apos;s economic growth .
the efforts , however , have triggered the withdrawal of the Democrats and nature groups that do worry about the effects of larger emissions on public health .
the website of the EPA says that the in@@ hal@@ ation of air , the ozone contains &quot; the lung function and strengthen the respiratory symptoms , &quot; as for example As@@ thma .
community community wants common room
at the end was the decision clearly : in two counter@@ voices , the Municipal Council of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ ners decides about the establishment of a common room in the future education facility .
before the discussion there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the still missing basic part is signed , Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ ades reports .
although it &apos;s still going to take up until now the church community is owned by the church , but there is no planning tool for that of private investor to st@@ em@@ atic project more .
there is a discussion about a joint space .
one of the two investors , which are still in the boat , has offered to meet the church .
on the ground floor there would be a living space - some 55 square meters - and a ad@@ joining terrace with a total of 70 square meters of space available for a special price .
the administration and majority of the Municipal Council are just before , such a common room is not right to place only for the inhabitants of sen@@ i@@ or@@ standing living room , but open to the church .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an example , the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ cafe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made the lap . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision taken by the provision of funding for the current household had already been decided in last autumn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the construction is in the renovation of the city .
the establishment of a common room would be so reported by T@@ j@@ ades , with 60 percent of 30 percent eligible .
the decision to sign@@ alize the investor you don &apos;t want to throw it in this regard to the investor that is close to it - as well as P@@ ult@@ d@@ ach - as well as P@@ ult@@ ab@@ ach - as well as P@@ ult@@ aneous - which makes the construction height - that would be possible .
un@@ necessary , not only Wil@@ fried S@@ oh@@ mer , be this supplement .
if it helps : unanimously he happens the panel .
it is not so easy to go to the common room .
Daniela Call refers to the many of his own buildings , with which one can not be so right now , but you feel back at the common room from the window , she says : &quot; I do so hard to do so . &quot;
Y@@ v@@ onne Sta@@ iger speaks absolutely for the joint room - but absolutely against a communal participation .
she looks behind a covered maximinum payout of oh@@ ey &apos;s own or even Foreign Invest@@ ors .
this is not even so , because with the acquisition of the area there is no supplement , but can get a real , in branch case , is the counter@@ part .
Sta@@ ig@@ ers application , the decision of the decision to be applied accordingly , will find three fears .
so it remains in two counter@@ voices at the original program , the Stefan H@@ aller thus summar@@ izes : &quot; if we summar@@ ize the resolution , we make a huge step forward to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot;

this was not good . &quot;
but the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believed on a performance increase in the first official match of the season .
&quot; soccer is also tac@@ tic , strategy , personality and motivation .

in the resin of Stern to star
in the resin , the nationwide first &quot; star Wars &quot; will be created .
this is planning the Club Observatory Saint Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planet in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; come to the information need of many har@@ dening visitors &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he binding nature , science , movement and sporty performance .
the members want to set up along the planned Route tables and inform you about stars and star pictures .
in a first phase to 2018 , the association &quot; well achiev@@ able installations at five to six places &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z .
in@@ quiries to St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ e@@ ge@@ i@@ ß and Sie@@ ber .
information on the tablets are to be supplemented by the internet .
this is why the site selection is a good mobile network reception .
also Acc@@ essi@@ bility is a crit@@ erion .
later the star train is to be expanded by train .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the star@@ path you will learn a lot of knowledge about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , they learned why stars have different colors or why a star is stronger than another , although it is considerably removed too .
also , in which constellation can find a selected star and when he is best to see .
the association has been running at the top of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg since 2014 , at the highest located ob@@ servatory in Northern Germany .
the location in the middle of the National Park of resin is according to information about the Federal Office for Nature Conservation ( six dar@@ k@@ est regions in Germany ) .
often there are far from the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a galax@@ y with naked eye .
since 2003 , there has been something similar to the plan@@ et@@ ians plan@@ et@@ arium with something similar to the planned star@@ vation - the plan@@ etary path since 2003 .
starting before Geb@@ h@@ ards Hotel in Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , the interior of our solar system , the plan@@ etary way leads up to Hain@@ berg and the ob@@ servatory - as well as an ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; site in Di@@ em@@ arden ( municipality of Gl@@ ory ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the connection with the individual planets - including the d@@ warf plan@@ ed Pl@@ u@@ to at the end point - are precisely in the distance and a scale of one to two billion .
the earth sh@@ run@@ k so on a ball of 6.5 millimeters in diameter , while the sun is precisely 75 meters away , the sun is about 70 centi@@ metres away .
the total distance of the planet is good four kilometers .
during the light from the sun to the pl@@ u@@ to about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour to stand with Pl@@ u@@ to .
pedestri@@ ans are therefore faster than the light in the world .
the march to the next fixed stern would continue to last half a year .

four Last to tire plat@@ zer
on Thursday , four persons were injured in an accident on the A7 .
after the first information , the drivers lost a Opel Z@@ af@@ ira at 4.@@ 30 p.m. shortly before the connection station market broad , probably after a tire plat@@ zer control over his vehicle .
the passenger car to the right into the vill@@ agers , where he survived and remained on the roof in the gr@@ ill@@ ful tyres .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were severely hurt in the accident .
during the initial supply of the last through the rescue service the A7 towards the north for about one hour , the traffic on the left @-@ hand side could be placed on the left hand side .
Fort@@ unas Hoffmann : &quot; Dre@@ ger chain works better &quot;
Andr@@ e Hoffmann is hop@@ ing after 2 : 2 at the season open@@ er against Braunschweig that brings the optimization of def@@ ensive information in Au@@ e points .
with the first season of the season Andr@@ e Hoffmann was happy , with the result , there would not be the two oppos@@ ites at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two opponents too much , and we have to fit in Au@@ e even better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the def@@ ensive player from Fortuna Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turning chain should also be optimised further in the Erz@@ gebirge .
and a fool according to a exemp@@ tion , let the Fort@@ un@@ ks don &apos;t want to take more .
&quot; for the future it will be so that no more besides Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) will present themselves on the line . &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better right after the experience in preparation with the turning chain better than with the quad@@ ron chain .
&quot; yet I don &apos;t know how we are to act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his coach Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is in his cause , &quot; because we have just in the Dre@@ ger chain on the half @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and N@@ iko G@@ ie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann players who can build up well , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ ite , but we are even better and we have not aff@@ ord to aff@@ ord many procedures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course Hoffmann is also back to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , however , I cannot speak to a mis@@ chief start , don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the performance could be quite okay , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we stand on Sunday with four points and can focus on the cup , we will certainly speak of a regular season open@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of which his coach wanted to know nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the start into the season I would like to talk only after six to eight days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el who would not speak of one advantage compared to Au@@ e , only because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be cancelled due to an accident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can start the season with a home game &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann believes that the player could perhaps be something fresh , since they could not be heavy and complete game like Fortuna against a asc@@ ension in the bones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t know about 100 percent where they are currently standing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the inner def@@ enders of the Fortuna . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although guests from the Rhineland , guests go to the Rhineland as a lighter favorite on Sunday in the encounter ( almost ) finished stadium from Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , because we have the right to come under the first six , Bl@@ ö@@ d@@ sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive against Au@@ e out of nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there is no crew in the 2nd Bundesliga which you have to beat out from pre@@ vent@@ y , &quot; explains the chief coach coach .
&quot; a such statement would be ar@@ ro@@ gant and ex@@ ag@@ grav@@ ated . &quot;
and so , Funk@@ el wants to experience his players on Sunday on Sunday .
new Results of the Swedish As@@ yl@@ age Review published
the recent findings of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , which have been subjected to a new method for medical assessment of age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested people are older than 18 years old . but not everyone believes on the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish Authority for For@@ ens@@ ische Medicine ( puzzles in@@ al@@ ert ) started with the implementation of the tests last year .
during the asylum procedure , the estim@@ ation of the age have to be more precise , after the Swedish Mig@@ r@@ ations@@ Authority ( Mig@@ r@@ ations@@ verk@@ et ) due to the assessment of the correct age of some refugees , the reduction of age were killed .
until today , Mig@@ r@@ ations@@ shortened 6.@@ 880 has been sent to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results from a total of 2,@@ 481 tests from the period from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 .
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in other 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency reported that person &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
in 432 cases the conclusion was that the person is possibly under 18 years old . &quot;
tests are only carried out in cases where the age of the person is questi@@ oned in question .
according to Johan G@@ ö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are resistant to the past months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t see a large difference in statistics of the past months , the numbers are quite constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the magazine The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases , in which the person has been judged as over 18 years , does not mean that the asylum seek@@ ers have suffered over his age .
in May , the Agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that it was 4@@ 42 cases that they propose that the person sought 18 years or older . &quot;
when the newspaper sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bl@@ a@@ det out the 5@@ 81 published results found that in 243 of these cases the person said that it would be 18 years old in that year .
the method of medical age assessment , made by Weish@@ eimer &apos;s gen@@ res and MRI images of kne@@ eling joints , which are analyzed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , was critic@@ ized in some areas .
a sk@@ ep@@ tics of Claude Marcus the Kar@@ ol@@ inska Institut , whose work is the assessment of biological irrit@@ ation of people , to see if they were earlier or later than usually caused by the pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think that the type of measurement should be used .
the biological age to assess this way is very un@@ certain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we cannot say it , we should not do so , as if we could , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the newspaper Metro . &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ ö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency def@@ ended the accuracy of tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of an adult is un@@ correct but low .
the largest risk in this case , if the person is almost under 18 , this case is about 10 percent . &quot;
fully in plan
the work on the three bridges of the district Road 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg comes well .
a seven @-@ ton emphasis on Wednesday was installed on the bridge at the eastern town entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .

the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg leads through the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a v@@ ault from concrete , which is dressed in red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4,@@ 80 meters .
it was built in 1900 .

this is a bound@@ ary set , which is also used as a operation .
the southern part of the bridge should be used on Friday a 2,@@ 20 meter wide bridge cap .
then the pedestrian road should be abandoned .
the special thing is that it is about finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges have already been fitted with the patented ro@@ ckets .
a special fing@@ ering feeling has the setting of lines due to the structure in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is also a fibre optic cable to which many companies are connected .
the residents were informed about the project through hand @-@ list of work .
in addition , fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be cut off .
for the bridges between the building construction and the collective in the direction Sch@@ ram@@ berg is the traffic trace is regulated by an traffic light .
for construction work on the bridge at Lau@@ ter@@ b@@ acher area entrance is the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotel &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den . &quot;
the cost of the three ro@@ ofs amounts to 700 000 Euro .
it is financed by the country .
Af@@ ak in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ lower protest at German potato salad
it is not so often that parties go on a strand , but when it comes to an alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , what else is hard to bring with a hat .

but those who are already at the beginning of the event before the event will not want to hear the Af@@ Ds , but demonstrate it .
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains colorful . &quot;
originally , the town @-@ pic@@ n@@ ick was originally planned under the motto &quot; All on a table &quot; on the fountain place , but now takes place on the parking below the Ron@@ d@@ ells - and therefore directly in front of those who come to the Af@@ ak event in the Stad@@ thalle .
a colorful picture that offers .
and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chair@@ woman of the Forum One World and one of the best organis@@ ers , really pleased : &quot; great , how many people come together here . &quot;
there are music and lots of food , including a &quot; ur@@ German potato salad which could eat the Af@@ D without any problem , &quot; says the woman who brought him .
the police has many civil servants to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence in particular at the station , which is only a few meters away from the venues .
how is the Mand@@ D actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes reported by the Mand@@ D volcan@@ ic sul@@ fur , he got up for such an event and get the surcharge .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some people love gr@@ illed cheese and they will eat it until the end of their life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but I want to test everything , &quot; so Kri@@ sten Stewart open all over their bis@@ exual .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I felt in gr@@ illed cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool what comes next ? &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most well @-@ known relationship of Hollywood stars was the &quot; T@@ wil@@ ight &quot; colleagues Robert Patt@@ inson , which eventually went out bitter .
despite all the insured the Brno Dar@@ stell@@ erin gave the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s B@@ az@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was in any serious , whom I have dat@@ et .
or do you believe about , I have played it ? &quot;
after their separation , Kri@@ sten said that it was bis@@ exual : &quot; I have ever lived and believed to be seriously .
so it has never been conf@@ used or disabled .
I just never liked , not to be taken away . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially among them suffered them according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ang show@@ bi@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in the school time they prefer like a Bu@@ b : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Govern@@ or of West Virginia announced that he changes the party
the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening event for a rally with President Tr@@ ump , that he will change the party .
whether you like it or not , the Democrats have removed from me , &quot; said Govern@@ or Justice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of offspring ... today I will tell you as a population of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you when I &apos;m a democratic Govern@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rally broke out in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration for the rep@@ ublic@@ ans , &quot; added Justice .
&quot; as a trainer I would say that it is at the time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised before a great announcement at the West Virginia Rally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice was not the democratic Candi@@ date Hill@@ ary Clinton .
in 2016 Justice , according to Forbes of the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
Forbes clearly states that he has received carbon dioxide in five countries , and made a carbon store from his father .
it is worth about 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
in the meantime , the Republi@@ can national committee gave a statement on Thursday evening , in which it said : &quot; the party changing of Govern@@ or Justice is another blow for a democratic party that would rather hin@@ der to work for our country . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with only 15 Gou@@ vy and the check of the only legal situation in history is the announcement of Govern@@ or Justice only the last re@@ jection of a party , which is not able to find out from above to bottom , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The R@@ NC @-@ Chair@@ woman R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel said in a statement by C@@ BS News &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in the IA@@ AF congress , D@@ mit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ ak@@ ht@@ in said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the Athlet@@ ics World Championships that it was correct and that he was decided to fight the d@@ oping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes who were competing in competitions gold and silver medals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in spite of his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress was approved for the maintenance of the ban which had been imposed in November 2015 , after a report of the world anti @-@ d@@ oping agency ( WA@@ DA ) remarks on state @-@ sponsored d@@ oping in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open response , a very hon@@ est presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF @-@ President Co@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire Council and the entire congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has witnessed itself , that they have experienced some hot times , and everything is possible to make sure the Federation shall be redesigned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CO@@ E said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is also pleased that Russia accepted the criteria for its deployment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constru@@ ctional Day , and I think progress made progress , but the Congress does not support the recommendations of the Task Force , that this is not the moment to use Russia , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; we must do everything in the next few months to norm@@ alize this situation .
the basic principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the with@@ ered system , &quot; he added
ninet@@ een Russian athletes are competing with the Athlet@@ ics World Championships that will begin on Friday in London after the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral actors .
the head of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must still meet some of the criteria for a re@@ setting .
drug tests are still in@@ adequate and forbidden train@@ ers are still free , he said repor@@ ters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council .

Prince Hen@@ rik never made a H@@ ehl of it , that he was not happy with his title .
after the throne of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 he would like to become king .
in 2016 he retired from retirement and puts the title &quot; prin@@ cess@@ es &quot; title .

in a Auto@@ biography Hen@@ rik over the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did , critic@@ ises .
my Danish was weak@@ ly , I preferred wine instead of beer , soap , instead of cords , Citroën instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ om , which I smo@@ ked instead of Virginia @-@ tobacco , and that can be able to be the trademark of the Crit@@ ical Intel@@ lec@@ tual Intel@@ lec@@ tual , I could not hope .
I was different .
I seemed to be happy with this position and not to be ashamed .
that were equal to two errors ! &quot;
Prime Minister Weil wants a new election
CDU and F@@ DP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
rainfall in Lower Saxony Stephan Weil ( SPD ) , after the loss of the red @-@ green government multilingual network for a rapid re@@ election of the day , he will not want to return .
because he spoke out on Friday for the dis@@ solution of the Parliament .
previously , the surprising Austr@@ ali@@ ation of a Green @-@ M@@ EP@@ s from their parliament in Lower Saxony in Lower Saxony was over@@ thrown by the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) in a severe crisis .
five months before the official date of the Parliament election , the red @-@ green Coalition in Hannover lost their cris@@ p majority vote in parliament to the opposition from the CDU and F@@ DP .
the old Green @-@ member El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets founded a step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in its elec@@ toral circuit in Rot@@ enburg ( W@@ üm@@ me ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CDU , &quot; declared it on Friday in Hanover .
the CDU faction chief Bj@@ örn Th@@ ur@@ ler wants to recommend to record it .
thus , CDU and F@@ DP were together 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Parliament , SPD and Grün@@ e 68 seats .
so far , the relationship was vice vers@@ a .
the new Parliament will be elected to the next year on January 14 .
Th@@ ick@@ ler told , the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether they could continue to rule in this situation without a majority .
Stephan Weil , however , however , remains un@@ successful , that the country tag as possible quickly dis@@ solves his self @-@ resolution .
the CDU faction is expected to decide on their further progress on Tuesday .
the state of the state also sees the opportunity to escape the trust of the country &apos;s ministers and cho@@ oses a successor .
&quot; our constitution offers several options .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these possibilities must be legally tested &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ick@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will be aware of all the questions if they are legally tested . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Th@@ ick@@ ler named T@@ hat@@ ens Step &quot; but something cur@@ i@@ os . &quot;
the policy in himself stressed : &quot; I &apos;m not betra@@ y .
I feel very good . &quot;
she called as a winner of black @-@ green .
the gre@@ enery demanded the ab@@ hor@@ red de@@ pu@@ ties for the return of their country @-@ day return .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we go of course that she has received their country @-@ day that she has returned over the green country , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the president met@@ a Janssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner with immediate effect . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the leader of the Green Anja P@@ iel said : &quot; we regre@@ t the decision of El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets . &quot;
I decided to conduct no translation language in the Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in front of the background that there were no in@@ significant differences , we cannot find this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SPD Chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the president of Lower Saxony @-@ MPs El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets to the CDU as a betra@@ yal .
&quot; the behavior of the former Green Party in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal to the voters and voters , but also betra@@ yal to Red @-@ Green , &quot; wrote the B@@ und@@ esch@@ ef of Social Democrats on Friday on Facebook .
he under@@ took the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) to re@@ choose the landing day quickly .
the Austr@@ ali@@ ah outlet cost Red @-@ Green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the policy of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in its last E@@ it@@ el@@ iness &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in its pro@@ ust their personal interests before the state of the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critic@@ ized SPD @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus salvation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ and@@ al that the CDU in Lower Saxony makes this dirty in@@ tri@@ gen@@ ome and tries to propose the political capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , threw T@@ jack@@ ets , with the personal career as the result of the 2013 Parliament election .
the CDU was the strongest power in front of the SPD , SPD and Green in the country but a small @-@ thin majority of a voice .
Minister of Agriculture in the Interview - How do we protect against Gi@@ ft@@ ei@@ vers , Mr Schmidt ?
Germany discussed about ver@@ sely eggs .
how could the sc@@ and@@ al happen ?
how can consumers protect consumers .
the Federal Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is in an interview with the editorial network Deutschland ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
LORD Schmidt , How can I protect the consumer from po@@ is@@ oned eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumers and consumers to check the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp print .
according to the Consumer Protection portal www.@@ food war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states provide the latest information on the infected eggs batch .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even though , according to everything we know , a health concern is excluded .
takes Al@@ di the best possible crisis reaction - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the re@@ conn@@ aissance government is not really true ?
the food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
nevertheless , my house is immediately switched on and has since dis@@ closure of the subject of Germany in close exchange with the authorities of the countries .
all information and risk assessment are available for consumers .
the trade has just as the manufacturers to worry about that the sold products are sustainable and health are un@@ th@@ ink@@ able .
if with eggs of the backrest level of 0.000@@ 5@@ mg / kg , these are not connected .
un@@ loaded eggs can be sold and consumed .
this time are not the agriturismi to bl@@ ame .
sitting production plants and consumers in the same boat ?
after the ze@@ al code , production companies meets no immediate fault .
rather , they must count them due to mut@@ ually illegal practices of service companies with economic damages .
as always there is a little control in the harvest .
is missing it only at the staff or even on the mu@@ ff@@ icking jurisdiction ?
there were just the official controls that have uncovered the process .
however , in truth , food amounted to 100 percent of food and criminal energy can never be excluded .
this is why a consequ@@ ent re@@ conn@@ aissance of such events and hand@@ over to the prosec@@ utor in the cases where pen@@ alties can be found , of decisive importance .
I have already made several times clear that I &apos;m expecting a re@@ iter@@ ation of the responsible authorities .
is the regular alarm system really necessary for food sc@@ and@@ als ?
consumers and consumers have the right to get safe and traffic @-@ ready food .
if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ ci@@ de in food industry is used , consumer goods and consumers are dis@@ rup@@ ted .
by the ge@@ aring funds are manufacturers , tra@@ ders and consumers in a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
basically , it must be clear : the lawful use of the insec@@ ti@@ ci@@ ds Fi@@ um@@ il in the attitude of life @-@ care animals is not acceptable and must be terminated immediately .
it must consistently be consistently and worked with high pressure on all levels .
I expect from all the competent authorities that the atomic fact is breeding and re@@ iter@@ ated .
how to move the financial rules of football to Ne@@ ym@@ ars to Paris
the rules that aim to prevent un@@ hin@@ dered issues of European football , Ne@@ ym@@ ars world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain will not distur@@ b .
any consequences are coming to Paris Saint @-@ Germain from the UEFA Cup , because the leader organization that monitors the European game monitors power to offer teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair @-@ Play @-@ Rules , which were launched by UEFA UEFA 2011 , mean that PS@@ G must eventually show that the transfer of Ne@@ ym@@ ar was financed without great losses .
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 262 million euros ) to buy Bras@@ ili@@ aner from its contract , and Ne@@ ym@@ ar will receive a salary that will amount to several ten million dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of Ne@@ ym@@ ars move to France .
PS@@ G can make sure that Ne@@ ym@@ ar under@@ writing Ne@@ ym@@ ar and bring him into a galax@@ y of other stars , in view of the financing of the team by the power of the power of Qatar .
you must pay a lot of money for the acquisition of players a lot of money , but must take advantage of legitim@@ ate sources that allow them to enable the break @-@ even point in their way to the football @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini to his election to the UEFA President in 2007 .
the former French player believed that there was an enormous debt in their heads , effectively che@@ ating and ris@@ ed to ru@@ in@@ ate , if banks or owners returned their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P moved from the concentration to the debts of the clubs on the monitoring of their losses .
the amendment meant that the business@@ man &apos;s novel Ab@@ ram@@ ovi@@ ch was originally used in 2003 in Chelsea - a club with potential and then strongly invested in order to build the team and to build a global brand - to a har@@ der matter .
during the current three @-@ year @-@ old FF@@ P de@@ duction period , which runs until 2018 , Clubs can take losses in the amount of EUR 30 million .
and even though Plat@@ ini has fallen by the presi@@ dency in the Un@@ gn@@ ade , his UEFA successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander Ce@@ fer@@ in continues to take advantage of superior issues .
&quot; surely , FF@@ P is not dead and we will be able to strengthen the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so who is responsible for the UEFA for FF@@ P , compared to The Associated Press in the past week .
although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out cl@@ ause of Ne@@ ym@@ ar in a package , it can distribute the amount for the invoice on the duration of its contract .
Ne@@ ym@@ ar signed a five @-@ year contract for the coming five years in the amount of EUR 4@@ 4.4 million in the annual financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 launched the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the he@@ avi@@ est sanctions .
the PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( at that time $ 82 million ) , which later lowered to 20 million euros , and it was arranged that the teams for the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 was limited to 21 players , otherwise normal 25 players remain limited .
the UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to over@@ lists its financial intermedi@@ aries , by companies connected their revenues by companies that are connected to the owners of a Clubs .
while a Catalan company will sponsor PS@@ G if the value of Spon@@ sor@@ ts should exceed the standard market rates , the UEFA wouldn &apos;t be considered legitim@@ ate income .
exactly this happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the value of the sponsor@@ ship of the PSA by the Qatar Tourism Authority was put down .
it was reported that part of PS@@ G payments to Ne@@ ym@@ ar could come to Ne@@ ym@@ ar over payments of the 2006 World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 have disp@@ uted that Ne@@ ym@@ ar World Championship will become an ambassador for the UEFA reg@@ uli@@ ar authorities .
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEFA will be even more effective , any attempt to keep the rules .
the UEFA had no pre @-@ prepared talks with PS@@ G about Ne@@ ym@@ ars Transfer , christ@@ ened the people who are familiar with the situation .
they spoke under the condition of an@@ onym@@ ity with The Associated Press , since they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest published reports that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 achieved a turnover of € 54@@ 2.4 million with a turnover of more than 10 million euros .
the accounts for the last financial year must be published .
PS@@ G awaits that Ne@@ ym@@ ars arrive a blessing for Spon@@ sor@@ ing @-@ Deals , mer@@ chan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ c@@ ist@@ rate .
the association proceeds that the turnover will rise by at least 30 percent after the signing of the signing .
the Spanish League was definitely ir@@ rel , one of the best football player to see , and trying to prevent Ne@@ ym@@ ars to prevent them that PS@@ G would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P .
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financial D@@ oping &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the president of the La Liga , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Kat@@ ars last owner to PS@@ G .
Arsenal @-@ Manager Ar@@ s@@ ene W@@ enger , whose club is owned by an American sport ty@@ co@@ ons , share the pre @-@ stop of La Liga against a state that financed an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the owner and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football in the last 15 years &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ enger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; once a land has an association , everything is possible .
it is very difficult to respect the Fin@@ alist Fair@@ play because you can have different ways or have different interests , if a country has such a big player to represent a country . &quot;

blow against drugs @-@ Mafia in the country
the police is a blow against Italian Mafia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , in the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald @-@ Ba@@ ar district , in Rot@@ tw@@ eil , Kon@@ stanz , Esslingen and Stuttgart were searched for numerous objects like the prosec@@ utor &apos;s appeal on Friday .
between the ages of 25 and 77 , he was arrested and issued by the arrest warran@@ ts issued by arrest warran@@ ts .
in addition , the official larger amounts of mari@@ juana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms and several hundred thousand euros are safe .
in the same Raz@@ zi@@ en in Italy two persons were arrested .
against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans there was German arrest warran@@ ts .
the two are therefore to be shipped to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investigations were involved in the action .
more than 300 polic@@ emen were used .
the members of the Mafia , organized drugs criminal , severe violence , committed murder , as well as a rob@@ ber@@ y and press@@ ant .
since summer 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s public prosec@@ utor has been established against the organized drug trading in the south of German room .
between the prosec@@ utor in Constance and Palermo there were a re@@ juven@@ ating exchange and the investig@@ ator of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
the big insert on Wednesday morning was also accompanied by four civil servants from Palermo .

way : great L@@ gs in the fore@@ igner @-@ Register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data of citizens who should not be diving &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : a report that the foreigners register in Germany has considerable short@@ com@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lead to part engraved mis@@ decisions in asylum procedures .
the Commissioner for the refugee management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , has made a media report on big g@@ aps in the foreign register .
def@@ ici@@ encies of the relevant data might result in an analysis with asylum procedures and deportation , &quot; in a analysis that the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; lies in an analysis .
according to the reports , ten million people with foreign nationality are recorded , including about 5.7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data are therefore managed by about 600 foreign agencies in Germany .
because the data has not been well maintained , be the data quality in parts so far so far .
in individual cases , data from 1921 have been found , &quot; by people who have long been no longer in life , or of citizens who have become German citizens and not to dive in the register . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; def@@ ective data sharing can significantly slow down , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report to the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the statistics of travelling people , the EU citizens are listed , that would not have to go out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such false assign@@ ments &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; led to a debate about dealing with travel agent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is stated in the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the Federal Government apparently began to return refugee families with 16 @-@ year @-@ old children back to Italy when they arrived from there .
this go out of an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( B@@ AM@@ F ) , the &quot; Neue Plastics newspaper &quot; was reported . &quot;
in the paper , this means that B@@ AM@@ F perform such procedures &quot; concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and infants - according to Italy since June 1 , 2017 . &quot;
since the end of 2014 , this was practically no longer possible , the newspaper under reference to the difficult situation .
following the Dublin Agreement , the EU State is responsible for refugees at the first time .
when a migran@@ t travels to another EU country , this State can send him back to the eland .
on the basis of the grounds , the Office now write : &quot; meanwhile , the capacity capacity for families with minor children has increased considerably in Italy . &quot;
Italy have submitted for the recording and accommodation of families guaranteed .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( E@@ GM@@ R ) hold these additions for sufficient .
other EU countries would also send refugees in the framework of Dublin &apos;s agreement .
the internal political spokes@@ woman of the Lin@@ ks@@ fra@@ ction in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children above , because of the def@@ ici@@ encies in the Italian asylum system of human rights and a companion of childhood . &quot;

the Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25 %
the Bank of England is expected to remain later announced that interest rates remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation in a rise .
the Bank of England war@@ ned that economic growth &quot; deals will remain , when she retained interest rates on family income in the middle of a reinforced print .
the Bank &apos;s political decision makers ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank voted with 6 to 2 to hold the interest rates on 0,25 % , with this month less members increase a rise since the weak economic growth has weak@@ ened the support for an increase .
in its quarterly annual inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.6 % , and war@@ ned that the pressure would continue to continue on the household income , whereby the inflation expected to rise to almost 3 % in autumn .
but they sign@@ alized that in the next few years , interest rate would be necessary to ch@@ ased out by Bre@@ x@@ it , and she said that the loan costs may increase more than expected to the financial markets .
the members voted to withdraw a part of the mamm@@ oth business package that was published before a year after Bre@@ x@@ it was published .
it will provide time for the financing plan to provide for the financial budget for banks , although it was said that they are now expected to provide 15 billion pounds in the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds Sterling .
minutes after the decision on interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; in the central progn@@ osis of the M@@ PC the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak , as the pressure on the re@@ unification of households continues to continue the consumption . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to the interest rates , it repeated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the cooling of inflation and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slightly larger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extent would be expected that the markets expect . &quot; &quot; &quot;
markets forecast the first rise in the third quarter of the next year and another one in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Bank stressed that increases &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gradually &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be limited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank predic@@ ts the growth forecast for this and next year , 1.9 % and 1.7 % compared to the previous year .
she retained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell after these messages against the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 Euro .
the decision of no change comes after the recent dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures , increasing increasing expectations on an increase of interest and GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the previous three months .
growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it is easy to recover from the end of the year .
the youngest inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households that are affected by a rising inflation and small salary increases , since the dis@@ appearance was worse , before being improved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that the monetary policy cannot &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it added that the wages of wages will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clearly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , which is attributable to the weak pounds , which is a part of the lower consumption expenditure .
the decision is a year after the lowering of interest rates on 0,25 % in the last August after the sho@@ cking EU vote , which caused the sin@@ king of the fun@@ eral .
the Bank estimates that it probably will last four years until this is the prices and the economy is complete .
prior to the last judgment of the Bank on the interest rates , the call increased to an interest rate since inflation increased to the pressure on hard @-@ spending households , with three political decision makers in July a rise to 0.5 % .
inflation has fallen in June to 2.6 % last month , although the Bank said that this was expected to withdraw it again in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the exceeding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ratio to its target of 2 % was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quite &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the weak pound &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andrew Mont@@ lake , director at Co@@ rec@@ o Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the shortest response of the s@@ wap market , the mort@@ gage market should be stronger again , since the loan has been looking strongly to shops and the year in a positive way .
the market looks especially well for those who run the existing services and will close the new mort@@ g@@ ages , and many with toll free options and low rates are increasingly popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( The National Health Service ) should dis@@ rub HIV drug 10,000 people
patients will be obtained from September after a fight against the financing of the medicine in N@@ HS access to a &quot; transform &quot; HIV relief treatment .
N@@ HS England announced that one before sexual intercourse recorded pre@@ ex@@ positioning hy@@ la@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) , which can reduce inf@@ ectious risk of high risk factors by around 86 percent , now being delivered by health care over a first three @-@ year study of estimated 10,000 people .
he declared to finance the trial , after the Appeals Court confirmed the verdict of the Supreme Court in the past year , which the N@@ HS had to pay attention to the Pr@@ EP in spite of the asser@@ tion that the local authorities should finance him .
on Thursday , chess was announced by N@@ HS England boss Simon Stev@@ ens as &quot; important new intervention &quot; during the National AIDS Trust ( NAT ) this as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Brigh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be the first to take the registration of people , and further clinics will follow in October , before it will be introduced in April 2018 .
pre@@ ex@@ positioning hy@@ la@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) is a sequence of HIV samples that are taken before sex to reduce the risk of a HIV infection .
studies have shown that Pr@@ EP reduces HIV transmission in inf@@ ectious disease significantly .
pris@@ m before sexual intercourse means that just enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection .
such medicines may be taken every day or so 2 hours before sexual intercourse .
to those who are coming for the treatment in question , schw@@ ule or bis@@ exual men , Trans@@ sexual and persons with HIV @-@ positive partners have not been treated successfully .
in clinics , appropriate participants are identified , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who controls a partner whose HIV status is not known through anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al treatment .
people who are registered in England and registered in a house doctor may also register for a possible participation in their local sexu@@ al@@ clinic .
the program will be £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract for delivery of medic@@ ations in this week after an international competitive property .
the study is to assess the entire potential of Pr@@ EP by adding clinical analysis , as it is employed in large scale , which is implemented and implemented in large scale .
Stev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should increase the far and increasingly successful efforts for prevention of HIV .
it is another milestone in which more than three decades of continued progress in the awareness of one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot;
Deb@@ orah Gold , Chief Executive of NAT ( National AIDS Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .
Pr@@ EP if it is targeted specifically to needy and end@@ anger@@ ed people , the possibility to change the English HIV epi@@ demic .
from September to become people with high HIV @-@ risk access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that will really be individually controlled and is not subject to a negoti@@ ation with a partner subject to improve many of many life .
we welcome you to the announcement . &quot;
Ian Green , Chairman of the Terr@@ ence H@@ ig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; the priority must now be found that the study is fast throughout the country and that no one has left the risk of HIV .
now , since the Pr@@ EP test medicine was built , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot;
Sharon &apos;s Hod@@ g@@ son , Sh@@ adows @-@ Health Minister , said : &quot; the beginning of the Pr@@ EP process is welcome and payable by the government after months of delay .
the evidence shows how transform these drug as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can finish the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this trial brings us a step closer to understanding of the advantages of Pr@@ EP .
now it is important that this study is so fast as possible throughout the country , to protect people who are infected with HIV , and that they will be able to join the dis@@ sem@@ ination of HIV in the society a step closer . &quot;
living life : mezzanine and cle@@ ver designers @-@ tricks have turned this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
Jo@@ anne L@@ eig@@ h , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , resi@@ zed in 2014 by a large house in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court apartment .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is a proof for the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed her bags and sold .
&quot; before I lived with my Ex in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much bigger space , &quot; Jo@@ anne says .
&quot; I searched for something that was comparable to my price .
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and she had the same high ceilings .
I have loved me in it and made an offer on this day . &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot has been completely overhau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ room property with a welded layout - you had to go through the kitchen to go to the bedroom - wanted to add the sleeping area and a mezzanine to make the spacious ceiling height optimal .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , a lot of light .
that was my request , &quot; says it .
for this purpose , she appointed Architecture and Design Studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Notting Hill , which was a 12.5 foot high ceilings and to create a home but not just a development , but also a place to life for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms over@@ took one another , so that the architectural challenge had existed in which one could stand in which one could stand .
Er@@ fan had to create creative thinking to solve the priority .
&quot; the steel plant is quite complicated , &quot; explains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were over@@ thrown in each other , without that we had to prepare us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it wasn &apos;t just enough to build a simple platform , but the steel so that it had the right above or below the right height . &quot;
this arrangement enabled it to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of additional drama .
for the mezzanine a classic copper light window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down via the gl@@ am@@ our@@ ous living area .
mir@@ ro@@ red gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille illumin@@ ate the style for the program .
using mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .
the two ends is mir@@ ro@@ red a short corridor to leave it longer .
in the kitchen the spi@@ der feels like a window in another room .
at the entrance we offer units space for all stocks and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
through the perception of a smooth noise , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when it is not used .
folded kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing is that it is about a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering went in , &quot; declared Er@@ fan of the steel reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door .
&quot; it is important , so that if you push the door high , very easy to run . &quot;
thanks to cle@@ ver use of space and storage room , Jo@@ anne was able to win additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land area - or as your property is estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ ment@@ ary form , a real estate business will perform and carry out a calculation based on the ground size . &quot;
here they have made it to enlarge the floor space and use high @-@ quality materials that make the room its luxurious advantage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; materials are the things you touch and therefore help to create a emotional binder in a home &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t forget to use in the electric sockets in walls .
they are important , but they &apos;re not playing with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment is characterised by a good design and increased square met@@ ers@@ ed of a little standard in something very aston@@ ishing .
in fact , as Jo@@ anne , you could decide to leave this not .
brothers fight for a $ 500 million real estate imperi@@ alist
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the d@@ ynast@@ y , in a meditation because of one of the largest real estate in Vict@@ ori@@ as worth over $ 500 million .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton @-@ Football Club &apos; and developer Colin De Lut@@ is lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . this has given him to the Supreme Court to clari@@ fy how their property and business assets shall be divided .
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp conflict on the separation occurs in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers have collected 38 properties in the value of more than half a billion dollars , since then the family bought a business in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood , bought in 1973 .
there he founded the West@@ co Je@@ ans family and grew up to a chain of 160 retail outlets .
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
this money has been invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lut@@ is now includes offices in the Stad@@ tz@@ rum , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler and shopping centres in the suburbs .
after an agreement with her late father , Colin - Paul is described by Paul as a &quot; main writer and the dominant personality &quot; in the De Lut@@ is family - about two @-@ thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul roughly one third .
a decision says that Colin receives property of $ 316 million and Paul valued at a value of 176 million dollars .
the distribution of real estate and cash has proved to Paul as a test point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the collection of Colin proposed task has left him with the left which I held for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote in 2015 in a first aff@@ id@@ av@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday , the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice took place last Friday .
the brothers are now competing for the control of the existing business - of which Colin , as Paul claims that have excluded him .
Colin argu@@ ed that it is not true , but th@@ rows Paul , some owners in@@ competent .
in an early aff@@ id@@ av@@ it that was filed by Colin , he says he hope to join the dispute .
&quot; my Italian Heritage writes that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote .
the costs climb in the case , with hundreds of pages with aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and charter c@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and from both sides .
Ms. De Lut@@ is and her late husband Luigi were Italian immig@@ rants from the late 1950 @-@ ies and bought a business in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early 1960s .
they used the safety to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood Li@@ egen@@ tion , opened in Colin the first je@@ ans of the family .
Colin says that he started in West Africa when he was &quot; in my last years of High School , when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lut@@ is says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , trusted her property to their sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi said often to me that he would never want the brothers before the court , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote her . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lut@@ is group , where Colin claimed that Mark were paid at the company &apos;s 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark , Paul says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Paul &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the conditions of its financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Colin has kept very back , although he was a former AF@@ L board member and from Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire of the Best Friend of the TV in 2015 .
Fair@@ fax Media participated with Colin and Paul De Lut@@ is and their lawyers in contact with Colin De Lut@@ is .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Colin responded by SMS to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really can &apos;t say much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the case is before the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very very sad , that my brother Paul decided to acc@@ use me and draw our family name through the dishes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tries to meet the demands of his brother .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father would not forget that Paul and I would like to end in our current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our matter will be solved in the near future of the courts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Colin . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , participated in his first working day with leit@@ end employees , he presented a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps Bel@@ em House , which he would like to repair : poor information that met in his hands of the President .
Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or paper - because the president would meet better decisions when he would get good information . &quot;
cell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to perfor@@ ate tr@@ ump by using his media service .
President Tr@@ um@@ ps relationship to television goes back for decades - and now where he is in the White House , its TV is still strong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the candidate was off@@ ended because of an un@@ fair coverage , it was productive to him that he received a fair coverage of jobs , &quot; said the former elec@@ toral consultant Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February opposite PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO .
Polit@@ ic@@ os Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; the key to keep Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter custom under control , according to six former election campaign civil servants consist of ensuring that his personal media consumption includes a ste@@ ady lob@@ b@@ Price . &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter custom is ever &quot; under control , &quot; is ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous .
perhaps this Kamp@@ ag@@ nen@@ beam@@ ten know what we do not know - that Tr@@ um@@ ps Twe@@ ets not contain any more spark plug without their inter@@ ventions .
we will never see anything about Twe@@ ets that did not broadcast the tr@@ ump .
if his employees work it already some times , trouble from him , then their efforts have been worth it .
but no one has consistently prevent it that Tr@@ ump Kontro@@ verses calls .
a part of the problem exists that people in a White House , which consists of competing parties , always try to present their own agenda by adding tr@@ ump material , which may be supporting their views from the world .
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO - throughout this story - reported in May on the pre@@ ference of advis@@ ors to provide the president of strategic reasons .
this was an example of the repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former tr@@ ump civil servants say that Tr@@ ump can react to negative press components , especially such with damaged Lec@@ ks , and that he will find out to recover from whence they come . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
exactly this happened at the end of February when someone accused a printed copy of an article from Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet Pro@@ v@@ ok@@ at@@ eurs Charles C. Johnson , who accused the Deputy Commander of K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; the source behind a cluster to be at the White House .
although Johnson was banned from Twitter on Twitter , or that he has no specific evidence , or that he expressed in the past false alleg@@ ations and contra@@ di@@ ct them .
tr@@ ump read the article and began to ask employee over Wal@@ sh . &quot;
Gold@@ macher added that the former Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary @-@ General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the tr@@ ump . &quot;
how did this work ?
Kelly tempted three months later to do the same .
perhaps he will prove himself as an effective manager as Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his im@@ pul@@ sive self , and its advis@@ er are still under influence .
these un@@ altered factors make cell@@ ys mission very difficult .
master@@ y Cri@@ me get Post of Europ@@ ol
since the address is unknown , the help of the population will worship and hopes .
the police was sent throughout Europe in this summer ( virtual ) postcards about dangerous crimin@@ als on the escape .
since the addresses of the requested s@@ crimin@@ als are not known in accordance with respect , claims from the population is hop@@ ing and worship .
Europ@@ ol reported on Friday from the action that follows the &quot; EU Most W@@ an@@ ted &quot; Advent calendar from winter .
the experience had shown that many vol@@ at@@ ile trips to the holiday , called it by Europ@@ ol .
one of 21 postcards were put together in 21 EU countries .
since 2016 there has been the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ i , more than 2.5 million times .
36 of the online companions could have been arrested , at least eleven of them due to the publication on the website .
trav@@ ellers on a gr@@ um@@ igation and return back to the &apos; million@@ aires series &apos;
some of the we@@ al@@ thi@@ est house @-@ owner of West Mid@@ lands are again tra@@ ded with some un@@ related trav@@ ellers , which have tra@@ ded one from the community of drawn tom@@ bs to re@@ claim a field in front of her mist@@ akes houses .
the trav@@ ellers have taken their 20 carav@@ ans on a field outside of a we@@ al@@ thy road of Soli@@ m , which is called &quot; million@@ aires series . &quot;
they have horses , babies and an army of transport , after they were exp@@ elled in May , without being sh@@ aken by a council taken out by the council in order to prevent their accidents .
the tak@@ eover group found a gap in the defense plants and pressing their vehicles through one section , which remained un@@ disabled to find a way .
the inhabitants of Soli@@ s have op@@ pressed the Council of Soli@@ m , said that it is &quot; us@@ eless to deal with the problem . &quot;
an anonymous residents said , &quot; They are moved there on Monday evening after they were sent from Bentley He@@ ath where they have cast stones on the fit .
the Council must be forced by switching to the implementation , since he used the problem with the problem .
the trav@@ ellers were there in May there , and are now back again .
more arrived in the evening , probably today more . &quot;
she added : &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to move in order to protect long sub@@ transactions to protect their parks .
I live on the Stre@@ am@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to pay my common room if the Council can &apos;t stop once . &quot;
a resident who doesn &apos;t want to be called , said , &quot; It is ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous , we just have seen the last round of this trip , only to be spo@@ iled by another round .
the numbers have increased this time and you even have seen a horse in the park area . &quot;
a spokes@@ person on the Council of Soli@@ ds said : &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the land beyond the Stre@@ am@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls together . we take the necessary legal steps to move them as quickly as possible .
in order to support our Be@@ ef collection , it is very important to report as much people to report an anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour during the police by sending 101 .
this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the Court must check , when we propose our case . &quot;
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof at Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof , the forest hotel Lu@@ ise is Lu@@ ise .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts is currently renovated and will be reopened on 1 March next year .
that are good news for the city .
because with the closing of the hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof by the former Ambiente company mbH to 13 April 2014 , some 30 000 overn@@ ights per year are lost and also revenues by the tourist tax .
in autumn 2014 , in the autumn of 2014 , the presence of refugees , which came into the district , and the hotel building was offered as a collection accommodation for controversi@@ al discussions .
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seek@@ ers in order to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not disp@@ uted in the case at the time .
but in front of all Freu@@ den@@ stadt Julian Oss@@ et@@ wald def@@ ended the site and spoke at the time of serious interested parties in the house .
he should be right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ hotels with Managing Director Birgit Sch@@ erer based in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern has acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three @-@ star Plus category under the name of Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Her@@ ren@@ al@@ b .
hot hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ is@@ en@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the earlier Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof there are already a long time building container before the entrance , and when you enter the house , it is clear how to work extensive renov@@ ations .
the floors were torn down , ceilings to the part , and old bath@@ tu@@ bs from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single site building .
there is still much to do so far .
&quot; it is actually a nice hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
all is to be renewed in the Black Forest .
the rooms are equipped with huge sho@@ wering showers , the input range is converted , new window will be installed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything should be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pretty close &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewelry . &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and meeting room belong to the equipment .
you will not be positioning on the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on a high level of downtown , emphas@@ ised sound .
the forest hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms to be wide , are explained by Sch@@ erer .
both single vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business people are expected to feel at the hotel .
convers@@ ations with O@@ B Julian Oss@@ et@@ wald and Tourism Director Michael K@@ rau@@ se he already led , so Sch@@ erer .
the performances of the city are cover with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
according to the height of investments , Thomas Sch@@ erer does not want to determine exactly .
just under one million euros , it will be charged .
the external systems are also brought to the fore@@ man , which is already clearly visible .
in an inner courtyard , a large terrace , which is publicly accessible from the restaurant , which is publicly accessible .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Aff@@ air : U.S. Special Jury reli@@ es Grand Jury
in Russia &apos;s aff@@ air by US President Donald Tr@@ ump , a special edition of Robert Mu@@ eller shall have used a so @-@ called Grand Jury according to a report .
the board recorded the work in the past few weeks , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; under appeal to the cause .
the paper evaluated the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller expanded its investigations and intensi@@ fied .
the CN@@ N transmitter reported that there is already the first discharge of the committee in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ um@@ ps the el@@ dest son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. intelligence services acc@@ use the Kre@@ m@@ lin to have targeted targeted in the presidential campaign in 2016 .
Mu@@ eller exam@@ ines whether there were agreements between Tr@@ um@@ ps Election team and Moscow .
in the focus of the investigations , several men are to participate in the campaign as an advisor of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
according to reports , Mu@@ eller also took more and more dr@@ um@@ ps private and business environment among the micro@@ scope .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the special edition Tr@@ ump personally settled into the center and searching for the design , whether the president in the course of the aff@@ air may be disabled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main task of Grand Law@@ ys is to check and decide if the indictment should be charged .
Grand Law@@ ys are therefore called a count of count .
mostly they are switched on if it is bigger and controversi@@ al cases .
the procedure is always closed behind closed doors .
the committee can also be switched on by the public prosec@@ utor to download people to the hearing of E@@ id .
according to the CN@@ N transmitter , pre @-@ inv@@ itations have been issued to turn the meeting between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian attor@@ ney .
persons who were involved in the meeting were requested to be asked of a statement , it was called in the report .
in addition , they should provide documents .
in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. , tr@@ um@@ ps consultants and law @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner and his dam@@ nation &apos;s election campaign Paul Man@@ a@@ fort became a conversation with the conversation .
legal experts said on Thursday evening on Thursday evening in the US television that we do not show that Mu@@ eller shall not be so@@ ber in his work , and that it should be necessary to act quickly .
but it must not be forced , that the Grand Jury will be switched on at the end to decide on the collection of an indictment .
nevertheless , the conclusion of the committee at the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for the concern for President Tr@@ ump .
in the midst of the new abst@@ entions , President on Thursday evening , a speech in West Virginia , to present the Russia aff@@ air as a campaign of his political opponents .
&quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; said Tr@@ ump .
the theme give the Democrats a way to feel good , &quot; because they have nothing else to talk about that they can speak . &quot;
his special advis@@ er T@@ y Cob@@ b explained in a statement that he doesn &apos;t know anything from the setting of a Grand Jury .
but this is usually used in the sal@@ es@@ men , stressed it .
the White House for@@ ges all measures that accelerated the work of the special issue on &quot; f@@ aire &quot; mode .
the former FB@@ I boss James Com@@ ey told three times that it will not be determined against the President .
you have no reason to accept that something changed , it was in the explanation .
Mu@@ eller was only used when Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had already been used .
because of this root , he became a crime against Tr@@ ump according to that he w@@ anna clo@@ cked the j@@ udi@@ ci@@ ary .
Com@@ ey said before a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump I asked him for a setting of investigations against the then national security consultant Michael Fl@@ ynn .
the president stands under big pressure because of the investigation .
according to representation of US media , the White House material gathered against the special edition and its employees .
this dis@@ band@@ ed spec@@ ulations about whether Tr@@ ump mu@@ eller released .
unlike an independent special edition of Congress , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate aff@@ air in order to return the president Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has held a position in which he could be fired at the Presidency of the Ministry of Justice .
several transmitters of both parties want to prevent such a step @-@ step .
two groups of Republi@@ can and democratic Sen@@ ators issued the law@@ suit on Thursday , after which the special edition could no longer be released .
Antar@@ ctic : gigantic Eis@@ berg drives in Antar@@ c@@ tica
in the West@@ ant@@ ar@@ tica there is a giant ice@@ berg from the barely seven @-@ fold size of Berlin from the Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is .
this divided the Zar@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred Weg@@ ener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the more than one trillion tons heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometer large col@@ oss@@ oms now to the north and I will probably need two , three years until it is melted .
with 175 kilometers of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers one of the largest ice @-@ ups that researchers have registered in the past three decades .
a danger for people don &apos;t go out of him .
how far the climate change has played a role in the sl@@ ump of the ice , is un@@ clear after research .
however , a total of about 30 years , a series of unusual tra@@ ps of ice cream in the region , writes the U.S. research centre for snow and ice ( NS@@ IDC ) in a factor of fact .
according to many researchers , the majority of many researchers could be merged with heating .
the broken Kol@@ oss was a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is so far .
s@@ el@@ fe@@ is flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by large gl@@ ac@@ iers .
thus it grows again into the sea and breaks regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is located south of South America almost at the top of the ant@@ ar@@ ctic Peninsula .
the north of this scarf was the equilibrium of wax and break down some years ago .
a complete shot is falling there , writes A@@ WI @-@ Research artist Daniela Jan@@ sen .
it says some thing that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is in danger , because the front edge have never withdrawn as far as at present .
in addition , the iron plate stand under voltage and could fall in case of a piece of a piece .
the melting of Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is and Eis@@ berg increases the sea level , as they swim in the water and p@@ ush@@ es the ice as much water as it yields .
however , the loss of the shot is that the gl@@ acier can be left straight into the sea and much faster than before .
that could possibly increase the sea level , however , only in the small size , the British research project to the observation of Antar@@ c@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is according to A@@ WI data with nearly 50 000 square kilometers , the fourth largest shame of Antar@@ c@@ tica .
at the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters .
there it breaks regularly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although it is a natural si@@ ent and is not aware of direct connection to climate change , the ice sign is now active in a end@@ anger@@ ed position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Martin O &apos;@@ Le@@ ary of the British S@@ wan@@ sea University &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is the biggest retreat since the beginning of the record , he also confirmed .
under scientists have been controversi@@ al whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is now return to a long term or long @-@ term , said his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
even though this researcher did not return to climate change , so in the past decades a lot of ice cream of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula are broken .
this long tunnel of Antar@@ c@@ tica extends towards South America .
according to data by the British Antar@@ ctic Antar@@ ctic Peninsula , the ice surface of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s .
the temperature increase was contributed to the decline .
the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have been heated in the past 50 years around three degrees so that the temperature at the fastest edge of the world .
CDU wants to go to the staff
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because it is always more difficult , to occupy free , calls for the CDU , from the employer association to become more attractive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just before the summer break , the Kre@@ ist@@ ag has reached 41 new jobs in administration .
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now even 17 apprentices have their first working day behind it .
the apprentices in circle are obviously very desires .
around 620 applications were to be recorded in this year .
nevertheless , the circle still lack staff to handle the increased requirements and tasks .
at present there are no interest in the M@@ ett@@ mann district after 50 .
we are looking for doctors and engineers , as well as forces of general administration .
the CDU would continue to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG initiative and to overthrow the professionals in the administration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the administration should work &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a concept for staff and staff development &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the desire of the parties &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is to cover not only short @-@ term requirements to skilled workers , but future @-@ oriented applic@@ ability to meet the applic@@ ant .
the overall concept should be orient@@ ated to the inside and outside , concrete measures for trans@@ mitting speakers and a training offensive , require the CDU , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
this sounds already after a good approach .
because the circle does not have to do with personal problems that one knew not so far .
other cities are good civil servants and employees and offer attractive conditions .
the speech is from a real &quot; competition of public emplo@@ yers . &quot;
this is a high number of employees , the disease or age loss from the service .
so the highest time to hand , so that no more places remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter peoples , leader of the CDU , continues to go out with his party on the common request .
he was already long ago in the Kre@@ ist@@ ag for a f@@ ist thick surprise , when he put the personnel cover@@ ings publicly in question , and the remaining parties were bl@@ ossom .
nations would like to be reviewed , that all the options have to be checked out of the municipal labor union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do not come here to a satisfactory solution , the county administration should also occur in cooperation with the trade unions - maybe even in cooperation with the circular members - a pet rate , &quot; so peoples &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , the CDU , employees and officials tries to pay better than the tariff for public service .
the sal@@ aries are currently exactly pre @-@ prescribed , increases or more money if you changes in a higher level which is orient@@ ated to professional years .
but the tasks of the circle are increasingly grown in the past years .
only a few weeks ago new rooms had to be set up , in which employees take care of the new Pro@@ stit@@ utes protection law .
not least by the rising number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ director Martin Richter has a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy tigh@@ tened the sound to NGO @-@ migran@@ t rescue rescue
Italy has encouraged NGOs to use the rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean , war@@ ned that they may not continue to continue with new rules for their operations .
&quot; if NGOs do not write any new code of code , it is difficult to see how they can continue , &quot; said the Interior of Marco Min@@ n@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a .
Min@@ nit@@ is warning came one day after the Italian authorities conf@@ is@@ cated a boat of the German aid organisation &apos; Youth R@@ ettet &apos; , because their team had worked effectively with tra@@ ff@@ lers in a way that ligh@@ tened the illegal immig@@ ration .
the aid organisation , which only has been in operation since a year , refused to ut@@ ili@@ ze Am@@ bro@@ gio Cart@@ osi@@ o .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us and remains the rescue of human life our top priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we &apos;re sorry that we are not able to operate in the search and rescue zone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organization in a statement regarding social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can use all the alleg@@ ations that are currently being raised , after we have collected all information and disc@@ usses the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had the boat of &apos; Youth R@@ ettet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , has been monitored since October .
it is assumed that his occupation of infl@@ atable migrants will be delivered to them directly by tra@@ ff@@ lers , and that the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers can be used again so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such meeting was supposed to be found only 1.3 miles before Libyan coast , according to the acquisition of the prosec@@ utor , whose content was published by Italian media .
the crew is suspected to susp@@ end themselves about the authority of the Italian coast Guard , the li@@ fe@@ jacket in the zone of humanitarian reasons and not from any other moti@@ ves .
under the code of conduct , boats , like I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , have to be aboard a Italian police officer , who monitors their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs who are involved in search and rescue inserts have been ready to hold in the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be un@@ necessary but acceptable , because they would not be any significant changes or disabilities &quot; their rescue actions .
among those who refused to sign the Nobel Peace Prize for Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
Min@@ n@@ iti has meanwhile said that the number of migrants who came to the rescue measures in Italy , in the last few weeks , the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastline , and co @-@ operation with local citizens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last days we started to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he gave plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month over economic development initiatives and with T@@ ad , Niger and Mali over measures to reduce the number of migrants who left these countries in hope to reach Europe .
asc@@ ents and tri@@ als
nine W@@ eil@@ er@@ mer B@@ iker , the &quot; Berlin outdoor post &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ enheim in the North Palat@@ inate in order to enjoy four days of tri@@ als and sights .
there were three friendly guides available for this .
the accommodation in the juni@@ per valley proved to be a good starting point for tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est from Wach@@ enheim was a welcome extra .
the first tour took place in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ sk@@ ap@@ elle above D@@ ei@@ des@@ heim .
it followed observation points , partly on towers , of which one could look far beyond the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald and the pre @-@ kept planes .
between there , there was again long asc@@ ents for long tri@@ als .
on the second day it went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to Sal@@ ine and the Volks@@ fest Wur@@ st@@ markt .
again the look@@ out spot to the look@@ out spot , connected by &quot; flo@@ wi@@ ge &quot; Tri@@ als and moderate an@@ st@@ ents .

after 173 kilometers and almost 4500 meters of altitude , the group had learned the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald from his best side - sporty and cultural - learned .
console instead of lawn - Bundesliga retro@@ fit for e @-@ sport
sit the sport stars in future before computer consoles , instead of w@@ ishing in wind and weather over the stadium to fight ?
fact : E @-@ Sport has long been a serious business to become a lu@@ k@@ rati@@ onal shop - great stars , millions fans and huge tournaments with high levels .
this is also known as the first federal states that eng@@ age increasingly in this area .
in the beginning of 2015 , the V@@ f@@ L Wolfsburg , later followed the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last of the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , which formed a E @-@ sport department , and two professionals participated in the computer game FIFA 17 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to insp@@ ire the new target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Executive Board Jochen R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is safe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that the train still rise again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
next weekend , FIFA World Cup in London organized the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; in London , where the Gam@@ er of different clubs will compete against each other .
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfsburg , for example Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Eindhoven qualified .
Robin D@@ utt also looks great potential in E @-@ sport .
Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen the ex @-@ Trainer by Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen has now been a agency for virtual soccer players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real football needs to settle in particular with the 14 to 30 year old so that young people still go into the stadium , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : temp@@ ting , all possible markets , mainly the Asian , to conquer .
with prominent electric athletes under contract , one could be online by more often on these markets , as only once in the year the Bundes@@ lig@@ am@@ ann@@ ity returned to Asia .
what &apos;s it exactly ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; when E @-@ sport will feature computer games like &quot; League Of Legends &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or even the football @-@ simulation FIFA at competitive level . &quot; &quot; &quot;
long ago , as in the normal sport , Li@@ gen is established , in which the professionals compete against each other .
and in Asia @-@ Pacific , E @-@ Sport is already part of the official programme .
but is it a real athlet@@ ic sports ?
for many , the performance needs to be unusual .
Ingo F@@ rob@@ ber has also dealt with the question too .
for the professor at the Deutsche Spor@@ th@@ ochschule in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because it is competent and many biological and physical reactions , which you can find in classic sport - for example , increased heart frequencies , stress reactions , hor@@ m@@ onal changes .
it also require cogn@@ itive skills , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a fast response .
professional Gam@@ er should not only exercise on the console but also exercise their body and care for nutrition .
&quot; the f@@ itte player is a good player . &quot;
however , F@@ rob@@ atic sees problems : &quot; D@@ oping becomes more a topic . &quot;
checks are difficult in online games , and in the scene lack@@ ed the structures of classic sports .
the scientists reflect the high integ@@ rative effect of the E @-@ Sports .
the players are internationally traveling , which is like a great global family , there is no intercultural shirts .
a study of corporate consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association of Inter@@ active Entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) says the E @-@ Sport a rapid growth in advance .
in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly on advertising , Spon@@ sor@@ ing and large tournaments .
in three years , sales should lie 130 million .
against the nearly 2.4 billion euros of the soccer league , this is little bit .

Michelle Carter due to the texts that Conrad Roy was sentenced to suicide .
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her boy@@ friend through texts and calls for suicide .
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her convic@@ tion behind him and five years have been suspended .
on 13 July 2014 , Carter was sentenced to life in June due to the negli@@ gence of Conrad Roy who took life on 13 July 2014 .
the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is innocent .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter could not remain free until his appeal .
it was con@@ fron@@ ted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but their legal representatives argu@@ ed that they had suffered from a psych@@ ic illness .
in red p@@ ants and a cream coloured bl@@ ouse , Carter stood there with tears in the eyes , folded with folded hands and in the lower eyes when she was condemned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her actions have moved Conrad Roy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Prosecutor of the court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she finished his life to make her own better .
she has no responsibility , &quot; she said .
&quot; she has shown no Reu@@ e . &quot;
but Car@@ ters At@@ tor@@ ney said , it is a &quot; terrible change that they completely regre@@ t . &quot;
judges Lawrence Mon@@ iz said , he did not found that her &quot; age or ri@@ pen@@ ess or even her spiritual disease have a significant influence on their actions . &quot;
a state of prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys Mother Lyn@@ n Roy , the pro@@ claim that there is no day when I pray not the loss of my beloved Son .
I would like that he is proud of me and how I go with everything . I try to bear with all my pain , which we will bear for ever with us , for his sisters , is it in it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ d@@ yn Roy , said that they would never be part of knowledge &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that they will never be able to participate in the wedding of her brother or a t@@ ante for his children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; no longer to have this one person , with whom I have been together since my birth every day , is a pain that I will always keep for the rest of my life with me , &quot; she said .
the case seems to set a justi@@ fication , since there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime to demand another , committed suicide .
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was dead in 2014 by a carbon mon@@ oxide po@@ is@@ oning in a vehicle .
the case moved national attention to themselves after Car@@ ters text releases that they had encouraged him to stop his life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hanging up , spring of a building , let yourself , I know not , there are many ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said in several news that she had sent them in the two weeks before his death , while he was with his family in vacation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the eye sight , she wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must do it , Conrad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything you must do , is to switch the generator , and you will be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter searched attention through the death of Roy and ordered that they should benefit from any press .
the case has the legal opinion .
to the few that Carter def@@ ended , Am@@ anda Knox , who was convicted in Italy in 2007 , was acquitted for murder before two years ago .
Ms. Knox , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times a comment : &quot; Michelle Carter deserv@@ ed compassion and help , not jail . &quot;
Joshua K@@ imm@@ ich : learn from the new mini @-@ Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
that Joshua K@@ imm@@ i was able to run at the Audi Cup as captain , no co@@ incidence .
the FC Bayern tr@@ ench a big season with a big season - an extra motivation .
anything else in his place in the cabin , the Joshua K@@ imm@@ ich looked immediately , even if the additional garment is very , very small .
but as far as far as far as far as the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , there was no Philipp Lah@@ m and no Manuel New to see himself , he made the assigned bin@@ ds to the arm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trainer has not announced it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; told the Con@@ fed Cup winner , after his first use as Bavaria @-@ captain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
good , the one would have better run better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but the sign of the coach was able to do so .
not the eight year older Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal was born in youth , deb@@ ited and just out of the vacation well @-@ commented professionals existing C @-@ El@@ f as game leader , but he .
sugar is distributed among those who want to have a lot to do with La@@ une .
so who has been educ@@ ated to compete the legacy of Lah@@ m , a small extra motivation is only good used .
K@@ imm@@ ich confirmed : &quot; this is what you would like to do : responsibility &quot; .
on Wednesday , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old is a mini @-@ Lah@@ m over the box .
right behind , which is now his position , the white Bin@@ de at the arm did its rest .
and at all , K@@ imm@@ ich worked in this starting information such as such as the one that can take the call on the best in the hand .
he gave instructions , trying to turn the un@@ installed tro@@ upe .
he had a look at all , while many others were busy with themselves .
Vi@@ dal therefore , to play his lack of fitness ( hing@@ ed hardly ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches therefore , on the devil , come out to the achievements of Asia @-@ trip ( also folded only ) ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le thus settled in their first appearance in the Bavaria @-@ Tri@@ h@@ kot .
that &apos;s all very good .
Sü@@ le ran next to K@@ imm@@ ich , Rud@@ y in front of the gun , both ag@@ ated sover@@ eign .
the nam@@ ing occupied Nap@@ oli storm was often difficult , moreover , Sü@@ le was also successful in the game building a few times .
his colleague Rud@@ y was too that the result was not so , as we have hop@@ ed for us . &quot;
but he also showed an ordinary performance at the debut .
game qu@@ ir@@ ation , template : &quot; for this style I was also picked up . &quot;
as usual , this Bavaria @-@ world is still used for the re@@ mot@@ ions , one saw the game in connection to the game .
Rud@@ y for example was not one or two , but determines six or seven interviews .
K@@ imm@@ ich passed after a few cris@@ p statements about his new players .
there he heard of Sü@@ le a interesting sentence : &quot; what is going on , I &apos;ve already noticed now .
in Bavaria you can simply win any game . &quot;
after all , he must not have the new one more .

Audi is to change 85@@ 0,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers are con@@ fron@@ ted with a counter@@ reaction
one day before the announcement of Audi said BMW that it would be able to update the software in more than 35@@ 0,000 vehicles .
the BMW chairman said , the company is the opinion that &quot; it is intelligent options as a driving restrictions , and thus moved to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is resident - diesel vehicles .
Daimler announced on Tuesday that three million Mercedes vehicles will be modified in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
one of the companies described companies as feedback .
European car manufacturer have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
but the nitrogen oxi@@ des that em@@ itting the diesel engines are considered car@@ cin@@ ogenic and can cause as@@ thma .
the costs for the car manufacturer , systems to install the neutr@@ alisation of the diesel vehicles out of diesel vehicles , also assume what it makes difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
the German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of ignore the mighty car companies and ignore the signs of the problem .
the company try to avoid the mist@@ akes of Volkswagen , which could regul@@ ate the use of so @-@ called anti @-@ old devices to regul@@ ate the regulations when a car was tested , but in normal driving conditions .
in the United States , several employees were charged by Volkswagen , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of the ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ ch@@ eo Giovanni Pam@@ io , is Italian and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be provided in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi accused in German criminal investigations after the authorities of Audi accused an system installed to handle the emission regulations in Europe , and an en@@ quiry that focused on the United States was expanded .
the inclusion of Audi into the investigation could possibly load Volkswagen heavily loaded : the luxury car manufacturer contributes to the profit of Volkswagen .

mor@@ dil@@ ated buttons and laugh@@ ter against the suffering
Mor@@ di@@ llo was time of one of the most published Cart@@ oon @-@ Dra@@ fts@@ man , the Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ ess of his figures are his trademark .
the Argentin@@ ian works also with 85 and works on a film .
his message : laugh@@ ter , &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immig@@ rants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist , he smote among others as a character set for happiness cards - what is fru@@ str@@ ated .
&quot; the most happy day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he said once .
after stations in Lima , New York and Paris succeeded him at the end of the 60s : with the publication of his Cart@@ o@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match &quot; and then in the &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading international magazines around the world .
even in China , Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
and again the artists were inspired by cities .
big , ro@@ ast Mor@@ di@@ llo figures in drawings with the slide Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and Red Square in Moscow .
on early morning he sits on his own information , even today on the drawing , daily works almost ten hours .
over cal@@ end@@ ars , puzzles , books for Gross and Klein , T @-@ Shirts , Pl@@ ush favorites and watches , are still a lot of spread worldwide .
since six years he has been working on a cartoon animation and a TV series with its figures .
the main person in the movie &quot; Crazy Island &quot; is a gi@@ raffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los most popular animal in his drawings - which has a thousand @-@ feet as counter@@ player .
for the first time his figures speak in the 3D movie that should come to the Kin@@ ol@@ ein@@ wall in 2019 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what they say , it is strange for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the script is not written by him .
that is why he rather reli@@ es on the TV series , as well as its original drawings , wor@@ t@@ less .
lav@@ ender threatened by climate change
he has become a symbol of Provence in France , but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change .
the Lav@@ en@@ del is remin@@ is@@ cent of the in@@ firm@@ ament conditions and due to the diseases of the insec@@ ts , what scientists and farmers , trying to find solutions , big head@@ aches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the agricultural research institute CR@@ I@@ EP@@ P@@ AM in Provence , said : &quot; the Lav@@ en@@ del in Provence has been effectively threatened because the plant was exposed to the effects of climate change , which has much less rain in the spring and much more .
this has impact on the lif@@ esp@@ an of lav@@ ender .
there is also a small ornam@@ entation , a mic@@ rob@@ otic ium , transm@@ its the di@@ aph@@ rag@@ m , and with very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is much on the game .
lav@@ ender oil is not only available for vac@@ ation@@ ers , it is also very asked for perf@@ ume and cosmetics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of very long plants with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , UN@@ TER@@ EN@@ TW@@ IC@@ K@@ EL@@ TE and either missing or weak@@ ened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so we have less parts with essential oil . &quot;
to the solutions that are considered to be considered , there are a better water distribution and slow@@ ing down of evap@@ oration from the ground , but also the occup@@ ations of the plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are resistant to dry .
the town of Ge@@ isa is celebrating its 1200 @-@ year anniversary .

the assassination of a journalist under@@ scores the growing threat in Mexico
the employees of weekly Ri@@ odo@@ urs will normally meet their plans for reporting about the youngest chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by the organized crime , corrupt civil servants and crash@@ es drugs .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to speak about security .
it was told them that it is important to change their rout@@ ines .
two high @-@ ranking journalists discuss what you feel safe : they should take their children to the office which were in 2009 the goal of a attack with gran@@ ules , or they are at home .
security professionals have written three words on a panel on the front of the room : opponents , neutr@@ ality , allies .
you ask the repor@@ ter , named for any column - no evidence is necessary , tru@@ st@@ ables and abdom@@ inal .
there are drug ad@@ den@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected to stand on the sal@@ aries of government or cart@@ els , a catalogue of crimin@@ als , which make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there are no peace break from violence , and while in all the country the cor@@ p@@ ses are frequent , there are more journalists : at least 25 , since then President En@@ rique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto received his office in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 , after attack@@ ing and thre@@ ats , there were at least seven deaths in seven countries .
among the latter it is editor and her In@@ spir@@ ator of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , the co @-@ founder Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest error is to live in Mexico and journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books about violence in connection with drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his lack is deeply receiving , although its presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Val@@ dez , which is based on the facade of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce building . two repor@@ ter in the three years , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez , wear T @-@ shirts who show his sm@@ iling face with glasses or typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop will take place less than two months after his death , and the repor@@ ters discuss their shared themes , trau@@ ma , her night@@ mar@@ es , ins@@ om@@ nia , par@@ ano@@ ia .
even though , in 2010 , an Son@@ der @-@ Federation was established to process the cases of journalists , according to the committee for the protection of journalists only two criminal proceedings .
as in most thous@@ es of Mor@@ den , which are associated with drug tra@@ ff@@ icking and organiz@@ ational crime every year , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are only rarely taken before court .
at Ri@@ odo@@ ce they still exist to treat the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are ir@@ ky and even though the terrain is still av@@ eng@@ ed .
without information on the mur@@ derer , without justice , the meeting was the discussion of safety little benefits , I@@ bar@@ ra says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very sil@@ ly , my time in this workshop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says he . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as long as we know not the why we do all . &quot;
on the morning of the 15th of May , Val@@ dez left the office of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he only managed to drive a few blocks far from two men before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was forced by two men and was shot on him , probably because of the name of the newspaper - who is translated with &quot; 12th river . &quot;
the rest drove in his car and damaged it in the vicinity .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to be freely converted to Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but the topic of Val@@ dez is practically nothing more than silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ mans arrest in the United States in January and the extra@@ dition in the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a became one of the most bloody batt@@ lefield of the country , since riv@@ alis@@ ing fra@@ ctions have to fight here to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or several people on the street are shot or that the gra@@ vey@@ ard is filled out of en@@ ched , two @-@ story m@@ esh@@ een for drug drugs , which are bigger than many houses for the living .
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; calm &quot; if only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal region with its valuable ports and drugs business in the United States .
nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the d@@ angers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , with the fault that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ understanding have contributed to the murder .
first published in February the publication of a interviews with Dam@@ o L@@ op@@ ez , a leader of one of the riv@@ alis@@ ing cart@@ ography in the war with Gu@@ z@@ mans sons .
this publication may have been missed the children , suspected the gang@@ pl@@ ers bought any copy of the edition as soon as it was delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ke .
the second error occurred in that Val@@ dez did not force to force after the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper which had published the same story to leave the country on its own safety .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and its killing is considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists .
he had so long survived that his friends and colleagues ann@@ ah@@ men that he would always be there .
he was in 2003 as an experienced repor@@ ter for Nor@@ o@@ este , when he joined Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars to the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce .
in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism , without using the cra@@ wler problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
with the time , the newspaper served a reputation due to the cour@@ age@@ ous and hon@@ our@@ able reporting , and sales and advertising .
repor@@ ters , hard @-@ coming investigations without fear of c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship , and the readers were fascin@@ ated by a publication where they could read stories that nobody else was to treat .
eight years after the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Mary @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Prize for their coverage in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Series &apos; of the Committee for the Protection of journalists for his courage to persec@@ ute the Mexican drug history , where she still led them .
he gave up voluntarily that he had afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to go further , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the time of CP@@ J Award . &quot; &quot; &quot;
drug retailers in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV last October .
&quot; you need to take the task that falls to you as a journalist - either , or you play the dum@@ b .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what have you done so many of the dead ... why did you not say what went on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ odo@@ ce Team is Val@@ dez , the Spa@@ ak , which was like a harbour worker , the friend who was gener@@ ously with h@@ ugs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted in his routine .
he would always carry his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ abo , the bar opposite the office , and there always sit on the same table .
now they ask : was his love for routine his destruction ?
his death also forced them to put their own concerns about it in question how they can do their work on the best and stay in life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like to move with their children , their children , their little shops , their secret start and run@@ ways , &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez said .
the result is , even in the best times , a high level of self @-@ scen@@ ic and self @-@ conservation .
trust his own inst@@ ink@@ ten .
when it is wrong , stay away from it .
the trouble is , the publisher of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce And@@ res Vill@@ ar@@ real that &quot; smell a sense that can be get@@ ed ... and then it &apos;s the thing with Javier . &quot;
the old rules , such as he and others say , apply in Sin@@ alo@@ a , no more - as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states , in which a po@@ ison@@ ous blend of lu@@ k@@ rati@@ ven dirt , weak institutions and corrupt government officials .
the landscape changes constantly .
in the room where the employees met by Ri@@ odo@@ ce for security training , suddenly there were no cell phones allowed . days earlier it became known that Spyware , who was sold solely to governments to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two polic@@ emen sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a middle class quarter of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in the Scher@@ z , some of the repor@@ ter , whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen who are the governor itself as not tru@@ st@@ worthy .
it is months ago , since the repor@@ ter went to the mountain scenery , where the drug bases are under control .
for the issue of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ce has b@@ aked on three main stories .
there were the assassination of the brother of the former artist Juli@@ o Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an ex@@ pos@@ é to the state spending , focused on the hom@@ etown of the Govern@@ or .
and there was a group that carried out in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the state @-@ old district , an ab@@ duction .
there was no official word , who was kidn@@ apped or as it happened , so it was careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favorite locally of drug tra@@ ders and authorities .
a repor@@ ter learned from public notes that the restaurant was registered under the name of a policy that belonged to the reg@@ n@@ ating Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( pr@@ i ) who ruled almost the whole century all the political levels .
several pr@@ i govern@@ ors were accused of corruption because of high @-@ quality cases of corruption .
in Vill@@ ar@@ real , Vill@@ ar@@ real bat the repor@@ ter about previous inci@@ dents in this place , among them one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man went to a military failure .
only a few months earlier , readers have been the column of Val@@ dez as the best informative source over the kidn@@ apping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier , we did know what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El FLACO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of its slim body . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now all channels of communication are broken down with our sources . &quot;
the office of Val@@ dez was dedicated to the storage space for signs and st@@ ic@@ kers , dedicated to the murder of journalists , because the staff had become something that they had never expected to say : activists in the name of the press .
repor@@ ter Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez schn@@ ed a few signs and went on the next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist for the Office of the state .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez was killed , in the western state of Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ an .
a burned body was discovered and officials said , based on DNA tests that it is his .
throughout the country , journalists was become stronger , having written in organized protests &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; on walking routes and buildings .
on that day the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is gone in Washington and tries to collect international support for the justice in Val@@ dez .
during a meeting with the Govern@@ or of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assassination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities to destroy journalists and destroy them , because they have said the truth .
she has never been asked that they are re@@ divided by the government because they concerned that their rage has viol@@ ated their object .
Val@@ dez had said to be repeated that journalists in Mexico of organiz@@ ised crimes committed by government officials and an Equ@@ al society . &quot;
in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that repor@@ ters were not only killed by drugs , but also on the instruction of policies and security forces , which were with the organised crimes under a ceiling .
last year , the media group &quot; Ar@@ tic@@ ulo 19 &quot; was assigned to more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico do you die , because they would like to keep the mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ram@@ i@@ rez said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously the Mor@@ de have a terrible effect .
no one gets the death of the blo@@ g@@ inist Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
your body was found together with a note that allegedly signed by the Z@@ etas cartridge : &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and headphones are next to their separate head .
some branches have chosen to close as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state Ch@@ ihu@@ ah@@ ua after the assassination of correspon@@ dents Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others do more like it did El Man@@ ana by Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo after the assassination of their director in 2004 .
in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ are@@ z established publicly on the drug cart@@ els with an editorial article on the front page with the heading &quot; What do you want to do from us ? &quot;
some journalists are from their home states , or even from the country .
it is a painful choice .
it is hard to find work in exile and still observe the streets and search for d@@ angers .
and sometimes they ch@@ ased them as the photographer of Reuben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who , together with four women in a flat in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who return and continue the work , it is a daily dance with risk decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , is that the drug tra@@ ff@@ ed him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico go to hell , and therefore I became repor@@ ter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last edition had already been finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce was sitting on the brush before the office and drank beer , as at once all their phones started to sum@@ s .
a number of shooting houses with belt ri@@ vals and security forces in the vicinity of the Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war continued , as it was promised by a series of cart@@ el messages in the region .
they released the news on the web site of Ri@@ odo@@ ce on Mobile Website .
the front page had to be changed to the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens in the vicinity - a further shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the polic@@ emen to see whether they were in read@@ iness .
if they were afraid at all , they did not show it .
under the enormous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for all Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his traces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just as you can remember , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if on the same day , on the same day , was assassin@@ ated on the same day to send the practitioners into the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ouflage to sof@@ ten his enemies
in the first sight it looks like a statue , if also a sc@@ roll .
now researchers found that the first findings of the incredible r@@ hin@@ ns of a Canadian min@@ ers were so good that experts have been described as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so good that they could even determine that his shoe skin was of red@@ dish Braun - and they said they would have had something of a &quot; un@@ quiet past . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Current Biology &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; called him as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the be@@ aded din@@ osau@@ rs &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs copies of the world &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier , who lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ace@@ ous period from 110 million to 112 million years ago .
his incredibly well @-@ preserved condition has researchers , who wants to describe it as &quot; really remarkable &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the paved plant @-@ ress@@ er is the best preserved F@@ ossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he was born on 21 March 2011 in Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alberta , Canada , pit b .
he met something that seemed to be on the place of the surrounding rock , and decided to see more precise .
the F@@ ossil discovered by him in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pale@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to un@@ cover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) .
after all this hard work , the finished result is ready to be revealed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have a little with eyes , you could almost believe that it slept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the main aut@@ or Cal@@ eb Brown , scientists at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum , where the creature is seen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it will enter the science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs copies - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
researchers found that this plant is covered , although it is covered with a arm@@ or , probably similar to meat f@@ ress@@ ors Din@@ osau@@ rs .
the heavily paved din@@ osau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ouflage to hide themselves in front of prey , and used a sealing technology that is used as counter@@ part , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have been allowed to mix better in its surroundings and to sof@@ ten its enemies , say experts that indicates that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million years old creation from the family of the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier family has made head@@ lines in May and is now seen at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studying the wild animals and it is called Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ ch@@ elli after the Muse@@ um@@ st@@ echni@@ ker Mark Mitchell , one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours to cover it carefully .
the amazing conservation of the specimen enabled it to Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and the form of scales and arms about his body .
they discovered the con@@ fer@@ ment , a widespread defence method in the animal rich , meaning that the tip of the creature was dar@@ ker than its base .
although the conventi@@ ons is common , the results are surprising because the size of Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta exceeds today &apos;s live animals .
it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ rs is ch@@ ased out of enough pressure by meat f@@ ress@@ ors din@@ osau@@ rs , that evolution on the con@@ front@@ ation of con@@ front@@ ation as a means of survival .
but most of contemporary animals that use the sh@@ ady sh@@ ady - do you think , Zeb@@ ras or belt animals - are much smaller and viol@@ ated as prey , which signals that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was subjected to a real fight for survival .
&quot; strong Rau@@ b@@ tier behavior on a massive , strong din@@ osau@@ rs din@@ osau@@ rs show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs cra@@ cks have been have been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ rs was red @-@ brown .
scientists continue to examine the beast on his life , including his con@@ fin@@ ed Dar@@ min@@ hal@@ tes to find out what it did as its last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ rs died when he died , into a river geri@@ et and into the sea , where he sank on the back of the sea .
at that time Alberta was so warm as South @-@ fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans are likely to spread much more land@@ wards than they are today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable because it remains entirely covered with con@@ cave skin , but also in three dimensions remains and the original form of the beast &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the result is that the animal is almost the same as in the early C@@ ret@@ ace@@ ous period .
you don &apos;t need to use your imagination to re@@ construct it . if you just need a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that he is at sleep . &quot;
the C@@ ret@@ ace@@ ous was a time when huge Ther@@ op@@ oden , car@@ n@@ ress@@ ing din@@ osau@@ r , who stood on two legs , through the earth .
although the king of them who lived Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , millions years after Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the paved din@@ osau@@ rs were ch@@ ased by some of his fur@@ ious ancestors .
this belongs to the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 11.5 m ) long , six tons heavy monsters .
scientists , whose latest findings in the journal Current Biology will appear , believe that Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta was sunk after the death in the sea and in the mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he was born on 21 March 2011 in Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alberta , Canada , pit b .
according to the museum it is a paved din@@ osau@@ rs in the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to th@@ igh .
the creatures had an average of approximately 18 feet ( 5 meters ) and have weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long peaks that ra@@ ced from shoul@@ ders .
the researchers believe that the b@@ lows was w@@ ished through the Western Canada by the Western Canada until a floo@@ ded river was floo@@ ded into the open sea .
but the underwater cre@@ mation of the din@@ osau@@ rs keep his arm@@ our in exquisite detail .
the remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the hood still cover the hood along the din@@ osau@@ rs on the din@@ osau@@ rs .
as Michael Gre@@ sh@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , it is a level of the conservation so &apos; rarely like a gain in lotto .
the more I see it , the conf@@ using it .
the remains of the skin still cover the hol@@ iness of the skin , which carry the skull of the beast .
his right front foot is on its side , its five fingers are donated upwards .
I can count the scales on its sole .
on the thunder@@ storm : mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A8 : many injured
heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A8 : almost 30 vehicles are wrapped in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
there are numerous clubs , long@@ ings , and G@@ aff@@ er .
on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A8 ) , there were approximately 20 people injured on the late Thursday morning in the afternoon .
according to the first data of the police , at 17.00 , between the lines of Adel@@ zh@@ ausen and O@@ del@@ zh@@ ausen ( County A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm , about 30 vehicles , among them probably trucks , in@@ breeding .
there are no information about the exact number of the last days .
it is easy to medium @-@ medium injuries , a pol@@ ze@@ is@@ pre@@ cher said .
a great explanation of rescue vehicles was at the accident point .
the A8 was completely closed towards Munich .
in the direction of Munich , a ten @-@ kilometer long retreat was formed .
like a AZ @-@ repor@@ ter , there came also on the counter @-@ road to massive disabilities - by numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire brig@@ ade not@@ ted the characteristics of vehicle hand@@ leb@@ ars , which now have to calculate with sensitive pen@@ alties .
shortly after 18 : 45 , there was a second accident on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
it was a coll@@ ision between a car transporter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to accident .
Deutsche Bahn : Group test@@ et &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot;
it &apos;s a moment that almost everyone has experienced once again : nothing is sitting in the train and sleeps .
or one is deep@@ ened in his work and has just a brilliant thoughts .
and then : buff@@ ers .
comes the Schaff@@ ner and wo@@ ke an uns@@ ell@@ or , or stri@@ pped the ride in the midst of the workflow .
driving licence control .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are over soon .
the Germans are currently testing the complete control card check .
one is simply confirmed by phone that you can use his seat and evalu@@ ates the ticket card .
currently , a test operation is currently running on two routes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes the offer , wide we are . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this will probably be available to many other correspondence routes in Germany at the beginning of the next year . &quot;
&quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; is called by train the card reader without Schaff@@ ner .
in order to use the use , however , some requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to have an online ticket - what will do most passengers already .
you have to buy it over the App of the railway , the DB Navigator , what is why the most convenient way of the ticket booking is .
and last you need a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will start in the train , calls his ticket under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the test customers then a button to the electronic evaluation process will appear .
the access to their mobile devices is a message that chassis is located on the train and has taken the booked seating area Y .
comes with the ticket inspection in number Y , he knows that there is a passenger with already on @-@ off online ticket .
you can continue to sleep , further forward .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has two advantages : one for the customers , one for the railway - what to use the passengers again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; those who want to travel without ticket check through our train ticket to check out in the DB Navigator .
this allows passengers to create your travel time in the train of personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing Manager of DB Fern@@ transport .
second plus : &quot; and our employees have more time than today to enter on individual needs . &quot;
who often goes paths , knows that besides del@@ ays and missed trains of the ticket checks are among the greatest trouble .
for often , in any case , one of the travelers does not need any documents that you need to make use of online tickets .
either lack the credit card or identity card or else a document that you have to point .
the consequence are endless discussions between train atten@@ dant and ride , which leads to worse mood in the part or major room and del@@ ays with the control of your own tickets and the Schaff@@ ner at the end time , to worry about others .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and also only on the connections between 915 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further draw numbers on the same route are not un@@ locked .
how a activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 , Britt@@ any was sh@@ aken by far as its core .
only one day after she arrived in New York City , sitting in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment , which she rented and sc@@ roll@@ ed by Facebook on her phone .
they are proud of a post from som@@ eb@@ ody from the High School .
&quot; the police has just killed a 18 year old child , and it &apos;s still on the street . &quot;
conf@@ used , since no one had posted information on its feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the Hand@@ le @ the@@ e@@ Ph@@ aro@@ ah has been constantly based on their Tim@@ eline .
the Rap@@ per in the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white police officers in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , was killed , live live .
he posted a picture of Brow@@ ns le@@ bl@@ os@@ em body , which was stretched out on the road and would stay there four hours .
&quot; this is wild , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought Fer@@ rel@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she put her mobile phone in order to return to twe@@ ets on the Can@@ field drive later on the evening .
there were photos of the police band and people , the crying , and from a man who claimed to be a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ ons Police had just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
they observed a live feed where a polic@@ emen stood before a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bell@@ ished dog .
in another video , she said , she assured another polic@@ eman , and cried , &quot; I will kill you ... animals all kill . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l had remembered her statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder that we have used to acc@@ ust@@ omed us and we can typically call . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that moment I felt Schüt@@ z .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
you booked a return flight and went to the next day .
after landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she took her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two next morning would pass after F@@ erg@@ us@@ on .
what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the topic of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in the cinem@@ as from the 11 .
it is a history of survival and the Protest@@ ants , love and loss , the strength and resistance levels , which consists of the view of the people who live in the community and the streets filled to demand answers .
in Fer@@ rel@@ l with her daughter , who drove a flower dress and a matching crown , the two had a conversation that they had countless times in front of this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black condition . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remin@@ ded you how many people have taught you , wor@@ shi@@ ped them ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she remembered that which she spoke . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we now go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that was not right .
I could not take it , &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l later .
&quot; that &apos;s what happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
they must know and see it , and it shall be removed .
it must be well developed , not only acti@@ vis@@ m and organization , but also know the various layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we must do to free to free ourselves .
even if I have lucky enough to give you a experience in which she personally experienced non @-@ lat@@ ant rac@@ ism , it is not different than the next black women child .
I have the feeling I would have a bad service to keep it far from it . &quot;
the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which was waiting for a camp , when the activists on the possible non @-@ charge of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson was waiting .
there was Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter joined with local business lovers , lunch made .
they made ready pockets before and hal@@ ves to pass them to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly began to accept a new kind of acti@@ vis@@ m for Fer@@ rel@@ l .
&quot; my acti@@ vis@@ m has changed after the 9th of August , &quot; she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student N@@ course Association and focused on essence of justice and health ine@@ qualities in black congregations .
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it is all come . &quot;
weeks later , Fer@@ rel@@ l met Ro@@ rel@@ l during an evening demonstration Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said , she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r wanted only to document what happened .
a question came to Fer@@ rel@@ l in the sense : &quot; you want to document or tries to find a story that you can use it ? &quot;
this sk@@ ep@@ tic@@ ism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often of white - in a community that benef@@ ited from their pain and its resistance .
like Fol@@ ay@@ an recently explained in an interview : &quot; we heard that people who were born in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on and grew up , their voices were not cent@@ ered and we wanted to make it differently . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area , which is known for its acti@@ vis@@ m in the death of death .
his commitment brought Fer@@ rel@@ l the project closer together with six other loc@@ als followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ns .
&quot; this documentary is not a man who speaks for us or talking with us . we speak , &quot; said Davis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the main thing for me as those people are represented , for so I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to concentrate on Fer@@ re@@ ll@@ s experience - to show that there is not a Messiah leader , but by a fellowship , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved itself as the most obvious participants in the film .
they show documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; sur@@ pris@@ ingly personal aspects of Fer@@ re@@ ll@@ s life as she loves herself and mar@@ ries her wife .
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that there must be a certain interest in this work and the human rights of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Fer@@ re@@ ll@@ s has repeated the role of the black g@@ ay women in the wider Black Li@@ ves movement .
two of the three founder of the movement , which have marked the film &quot; Black@@ liv@@ es@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in 2012 , identi@@ fies the film &quot; Black@@ liv@@ es@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media .
&quot; black , pregnant women in leadership positions have borne the movement altogether , &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , &quot; and therefore we fight at different fron@@ ts .
black , pregnant women must bear the main load of everything . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an voted to notice that &quot; the movement really is affected by black women and a lot of black women . &quot;
however , it insi@@ sted that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a result of the action of action , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Fer@@ rel@@ l , due to its identity than the heart of the film . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was the person who sh@@ ook this energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not co@@ incidence , although it was on the front of the front , because in a life at this cruci@@ fix as a black , pregnant woman is so much on the game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
in the meantime , the news @-@ cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on has long disappeared , but the r@@ ass@@ ical connections between the church and the police still exist .
Fer@@ rel@@ l is on par@@ ole for 2 ½ years because of the blocking of a demonstration at a demonstration .
she describes the social atmosphere of the area that she calls her home : &quot; a chaos . &quot;
nevertheless she has committed themselves to a song and she feels like this memory for three years ago in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on on the road .
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we must love one another and support .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
&quot; dream &quot; up to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; TV readers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : TV @-@ reader
the bit Gallery moves the people although they are still not built long .
but the idea of a shopping centre on the south side of the pedestrian zone has been ob@@ sol@@ ete since the first presentation in 2009 .
cold leaves the topic hardly any one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also on our Facebook page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is discussed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the one to the bit Gallery say : &quot; this would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; does not need man &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ oth ) or quite simple : &quot; size w@@ ander ! &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) .
while the fears is to build a gallery of more customers in the city , of which also the other business may benefit , fear the ad@@ versaries that then blow the pedestrian zone .
in addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the grounds , on which the pe@@ asant market hall stands , in which 13 directors are sold their products .
at the beginning of the construction , the end is finished .
the gallery M@@ acher want to integrate a market hall in the new building - and for Bed@@ a @-@ Platz with possibility of sitting outside .
Simone rooms : &quot; we &apos;ve been buying almost weekly in the pe@@ asant market for many years .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cake of the rural women are still very happy .
we also have discovered the but@@ cher for us .
we would like to wish that during and especially after the construction of the gallery a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also that .
the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether a direct market in a market hall in the gallery , comes to the height of rent .
but the new project is likely to be low even low . &quot;
Eva Kil@@ ic : &quot; why shopping in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , shoes , dr@@ y@@ - or supermarkets : I find the super@@ flu@@ ous .
there are already enough in our city .
you can see how many shop shops have been empty here - some for months and years .
but there is not even a regular weekly market there , it is so important that you will receive at least the market hall .
for all , the commod@@ ity is fresh@@ ly offered , is mostly offered by the producer and is ob@@ end@@ ely inexpensive .
as you see , shop shops in a shopping mall are rented only by larger companies , because the dor@@ m rentals are often not portable .
too bad , special transactions , there are almost no more and what is left , then still disappear . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping mall with a market hall adap@@ ts me not together .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
especially : where is the pe@@ asant market hall during the construction time ?
the old E@@ DE@@ KA would be the solution - even on duration when the bit Gallery is really happening .
or creates a bit Gallery already to drive all shops from Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; that &apos;s not just work .
and a shopping center , which is empty , doesn &apos;t need any one .
my view to it would have been better to promote a real farm market , instead of this gallery .
but for a pe@@ asant market to give it thanks to the mad many - as I find - sen@@ sel@@ ess construction projects in Bit@@ burg no place more .
when the pe@@ asant market is made , a piece of culture will disappear . &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
in the middle of the room of Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York many faces are to see - white , black and brown , which are almost unlimited - those on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ ils and Haar@@ le created by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent out the ex@@ cer@@ pts from prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former secret service analy@@ tics had joined a 35 @-@ year sentence , after she made diplomatic messages about the website of Le@@ aks publicly .
the new exhibition which opened on 2 August is called A Bec@@ oming Res@@ em@@ bl@@ ance ( An appropriate simil@@ arity ) .
it is the product of two years correspon@@ dent between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline has turned into their specialized expertise in technology , computer science and art , and man@@ ing , a transition from Barack Obama , when he had only three days in his office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been created by the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA from Mann@@ ing and could not only look at the form of DNA data - the many ways to be interpreted and the in@@ har@@ dening determin@@ ism of these interpre@@ tations - but also for identity .
Mann@@ ing , born when Brad@@ ley Edward was born , but already in their pu@@ ber@@ ty open over the identification as a woman , was sentenced to 20 acc@@ ents in 2013 , including six violations of the sp@@ y law , computer was and theft .
by the prison , her picture was supp@@ ressed , so much that it was only a single photo - a grain , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in the man@@ ing is very well located on a driver and a plat@@ in@@ bl@@ onde is wearing a plat@@ ter - which it was associated with it .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came straight from the great success of their 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions &apos; .
in this , the artist portraits of strangers made from for@@ en@@ ical arti@@ facts , such as cig@@ ar dum@@ b and chew@@ ing g@@ um , creating the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of it , such as these people could look like .
this was the time that she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in prison , and they wanted a sort of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg declared a press review of the new exhibition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it could not be visited at that time and she could not be photograph@@ ed , so they took contact with Chelsea and asked whether they wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her ma@@ iled M@@ use were sent to inv@@ ading Bri@@ eff@@ lu@@ de that lasted several letters over the course of two years .
they even looked one of Sho@@ o Kan@@ ung@@ o illustrated Com@@ ic &quot; Supp@@ os@@ images , &quot; which had a future fore@@ seen in which the president would come into judgment , and it would be able to see the exhibition personally .
that Obama was actually only few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ings release after seven brutal years in a military hospital in Kansas , was a welcome way of happy food .
there is also now at the opening of the exhibition something deep and Star@@ kes , da Donald Tr@@ ump leads a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to find the construction that he should actually fix , continues to escape .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked after the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen in a certain reason . &quot;
in one on the wall of the gallery , the artistic statement called Mann@@ ing with its superior signature ( the &quot; i &quot; in their family name ) is an end of the &quot; automatic cerem@@ onies , whose foundation sex , race , sexu@@ ality and culture have been . &quot;
on the opposite wall , its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thousand @-@ feet of Cs and Gs and As , in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , hop@@ ed to show the inclusion of 200 letters ( or nu@@ cle@@ ot@@ ide after the highly developed scientific Lex@@ icon of the artist ) , like amaz@@ ingly similar , at least in biological regard , we all are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what people are hop@@ efully to take care of what we are , and how openly genetic data for a interpretation and how sub@@ jective them are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video factory of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous memories &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , therefore the 30 of these stories are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition which is kept in a separate room is a page from the above @-@ mentioned com@@ ic novel@@ ty .
she shows Mann@@ ing , as it comes with a hands @-@ free @-@ ef@@ on in the hand of the discipl@@ ines of the United States as King Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they ch@@ ill your speech , they won &apos;t have won . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; never try the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter which she wrote me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist who gre@@ et from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I still don &apos;t think when I talk about it . &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition yet - as it was expected to be seen in the com@@ ic book - but if it should do it , then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room of Mas@@ ks , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ak@@ ras , which are tra@@ ded as hor@@ des of Protest@@ ants .
this was also targeted as all in the exhibition until the size of the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ings St@@ ature ) , where their genetic h@@ ap@@ log@@ groups were written with pencil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past I had it on the wall , but I wanted to feel like a human quantity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg said from the portraits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted to feel like a mass movement that looks like a mass movement like the movement , who was also behind her liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor of the University of North@@ western and an employee at the University of Oxford for killing
a nationwide human hunt for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee at the University of Oxford which had been sought as susp@@ ects , after a man had been in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with dead@@ ly injuries .
on Monday , for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham L@@ ath@@ em ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warran@@ ts issued for murder because of its alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as the acts of the Local Court of Cook .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several bul@@ locks .
a shared warning system from Chicago , published by the Police Authority of Chicago , was discovered that Lei@@ che was discovered on July 27 .
civil servants received a call , came to the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with multiple injuries in his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was declared on the place of the existence for dead , and Det@@ ectives examine the bul@@ che as murder , while the police actively seek after the two susp@@ ects , said civil servants .
L@@ ath@@ em has been an extraordinary professor for micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at North@@ western University since 2007 .
Alan K. Cub@@ bage , vice president for university relations , said in an e @-@ mail explanation that L@@ ath@@ em is now av@@ ed in be@@ l@@ ur@@ ns and was excluded from the campus of North@@ western University .
&quot; this is a criminal case that is examined by the competent authorities and the North@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; said Cub@@ bage .
War@@ ren is Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford .
a spokes@@ man at the University and the Som@@ erville College said in an e @-@ mail explanation that &quot; we are in contact with the police in Britain and are ready to help us to help the US investig@@ ative authorities . &quot;
the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens colleagues were sho@@ cked and want that he turned himself .
chief Communications Officer of Chicago , Anthony Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi , said that he would ask the susp@@ ects the susp@@ ects to set the authorities .
&quot; the police have a presentation of their residence , and our efforts to loc@@ alize it , &quot; said Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects .
Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi , the police received a call from the building administrator of the Grand @-@ Plaza building , which had just received a slan@@ ted tip that had something happened in apartment 1008 .
the police described the scene as a very cruel .
Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said it was not clear if the incident took place on July 27 .
it was confirmed by security cameras that L@@ ath@@ em and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the sacrifice had a relationship , &quot; said Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
the management team of Grand Plaza released a declaration to the residents : &quot; the police currently works at the time axis and the background of the sacrifice , including a variety of moti@@ ves , including a possible domestic pre@@ ferences . &quot;
&quot; we will close the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; - the Russian Vi@@ enn@@ re@@ mi@@ er Mut@@ ko
the Russian Vi@@ enn@@ re@@ mi@@ er Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said , it will not take long until the remaining criteria of the world anti @-@ d@@ oping agency ( WA@@ DA ) is implemented for restoration of the Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; in a certain stage of fulfil@@ ment of the criteria of the road@@ map R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) .
the WA@@ DA road@@ map was updated in this regard , &quot; stated Mut@@ ko on Thursday .
the PM commented on the second part of the schedule of WA@@ DA for compliance with the code that describes the criteria for repe@@ ating R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the website of the organization .
according to Mut@@ ko , he doesn &apos;t contain any thing for Russia &apos;s event .
&quot; everything was announced , everything is implemented .
and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and the WA@@ DA in the near future . &quot; he added .
one of the criteria mentioned in the list criteria however , however , states that the Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping authorities approved the reported results from WA@@ DA approved by the Canadian attor@@ ney Richard McLaren .
in terms of the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; we lead the investigation as our anti @-@ d@@ oping system has a mistake .
all measures have been implemented .
but there was no state programs , and we will not ad@@ mit something that exists . &quot;
Mut@@ k@@ os would agree with those of Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v , the head of the independent Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping commission .
in conversation with the Russian sales point R@@ sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v had problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping organizations , but added : &quot; we have said that the report contains controversi@@ al positions and rules .
no one has to accept this report un@@ conditi@@ onally , &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v .
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded in November 2015 in the course of D@@ oping sc@@ and@@ als from WA@@ DA from the execution of D@@ op@@ ing@@ checks in Russia .
however , it was allowed to plan and coordin@@ ate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK anti @-@ D@@ oping ( U@@ K@@ AD ) .
after a visit to the organisation of the organization in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA @-@ Director General Olivier Nig@@ gli , that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA is moving into the right direction &quot; moves to be used again .
Al@@ di sells no eggs than that

it is a pure precau@@ tion that cannot be assumed in any health precau@@ tion , it was said in the communication .
from now only eggs to Al@@ di are only delivered to be tested negative at fi@@ bre@@ il@@ ateral anti @-@ lung cancer .
Al@@ di would produce clarity and transparency to its customers .
the start @-@ ups that will help your company will not be to the next U@@ ber
A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure your luck at your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the surveys didn &apos;t work .
answers were often v@@ ague , little helpful or even worse - fr@@ au@@ dul@@ ent .
and even if you heard an@@ onym@@ ity , some workers did not do the process .
&quot; it simply had never consistency and object , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care Society Madison Re@@ ed .
it is called people from outside around .
a new race of the Human Resources Start @-@ ups is to help companies to help companies find out how their employees feel .
through the creation and licens@@ ing of software that has the specific purpose of the measurement of staff commitment , it allows companies to provide special groups and demo@@ graphic groups , employees an@@ onym@@ ity and complaint @-@ hot@@ lines to handle the C @-@ suite managers and turn right to the Board of Directors .
&quot; they now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for the persecution of their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software Analytics tools was used by companies to measure employees .
Er@@ ret@@ t said that she had a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t .
in addition to the Sn@@ ap @-@ surveys and surveys of certain teams , it offers a heat @-@ card of the company that shows the units most complaints and which exec@@ u@@ tives have low state results - so that you can boot , why .
companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture , you must not be able to stay at the next U@@ ber , which has been published in Sk@@ and@@ als since then a former employee has published a blog post , which has been spoken by har@@ ass@@ ment , with those who have spoken , to be punished .
for start @-@ ups such as G@@ lin@@ t , this wish is an overview of a lu@@ kr@@ ative business unit .
the Global Governance , Regulation and Compliance @-@ sector could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion worth , after the financed technical website let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments .
Denver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps prevent bad behavior and recogni@@ zing , saw an increase of interest and activity in the beginning of this year within the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
Conver@@ cent has nearly 600 clients , including air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tesla .
u@@ ber has recently signed as a client .
like G@@ lin@@ t , Conver@@ ted Conver@@ cent companies custom &quot; Pul@@ s- &quot; surveys to view confi@@ dential answers in real time and view the heat @-@ cards of your problem .
it also offers an anonymous SMS hotline , which can report the employee behaviour .
and when the leader is included , complaints directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judgment of public opinion has captured the reg@@ ul@@ ators &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , founder and managing director of Conver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a company found that his staff is po@@ or@@ ly treated or un@@ eth@@ ical , it can experience precious consequences through consumers @-@ boy@@ cott , workers @-@ flu@@ ence and pl@@ agues , said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant @-@ chain with more than 25.000 employees and more than 500 sites , Conver@@ cent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures , and an easy way to achieve their corporate headquarters .
earlier , if a employee wanted to report a problem , he had to submit or send a telephone number or e @-@ mail to the corporate headquarters , a formal appeal and hope that he was taken seriously .
it was often a en@@ roll@@ ment and un@@ comfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby TU@@ ES@@ DA@@ Y@@ S General Coun@@ sel , who said , there was no good opportunity to track the complaints of employees .
well , since the company Conver@@ ted , you can find problems that were previously identified by exec@@ u@@ tives , who were hidden in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or un@@ lau@@ rel intern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can closer to this holi@@ stic , 360 @-@ degree view in the experience with employment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who runs the risk management Group of Ruby Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Employment Act &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies started to take Eth@@ ics , Values and Emplo@@ ye@@ es of engagement in 2002 , after the accounting company Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed because of eth@@ ical attacks by En@@ ron Sk@@ and@@ al , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it lasted until the &quot; Social Media &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came to their right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that companies knew that you could not prevent their dirty clothes online . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the use of technology to monitor the eth@@ ics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both G@@ lin@@ t as well Conver@@ cent offer your software as a service , and loaded the company with recur@@ ring fees for use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance to support the approval of venture capital investors , both start @-@ ups .
Conver@@ cent received $ 10 million in financing in February of companies such as Sapphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , which was raised to $ 47 million .
Gl@@ itz@@ ern secured $ 10 million in November by Bess@@ emer Venture Partners and brought his total financing to $ 60 million .
this investment is hardly surprising , in view of the connected nature of companies , culture and Venture Capital .
there is a growing complex in research that shows that today &apos;s staff is expected to expect more than expected .
in competitive markets such as Sil@@ icon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects only inserts .
the employees want to have the feeling that you are accepted and appreciated and that you will give your time a company with a positive mission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if men are happy to be happy to feel their voices , and that the work that you do is worthwhile to make this enterprise successfully , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and B@@ ye@@ e Experience in Link@@ ed@@ In , who uses both Conver@@ ti@@ cent as well as G@@ lin@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot;
investors reach R@@ end@@ ites if their portfolio company will run well . companies run well when employees are employed and engaged .
if the Analytics tools will speak third parties , commitment and the use of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data about the employee commitment to experts of the workplace culture is important .
but the data are us@@ eless if the administrator of a company does not take measures .
in fact , if a company asks for your feedback , it may have an anticip@@ ation that change on the way .
and if the change cannot be fast enough , or at all , this can dis@@ appoint@@ ments and employees .
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you need to be ready to have 4,000 talks , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen the company to collect data on collecting data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you do not follow our staff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hab@@ t you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you take care of it ?
and who doesn &apos;t worry about why should I ? &quot;
Madison Re@@ ed , who now has monthly employee surveys , was able to redeem measures on the same day when a problem is reported on G@@ lin@@ t , Er@@ ret@@ t .
and after collecting the feedback from fru@@ str@@ ated employees , she was able to organise numerous teams within the company and to add multiple teams within the company and to add a communication training in order to tackle the problems .
in Ruby Tuesday , the company will always receive new in@@ sights on employees , and it hopes that on long sight , this leads to a better binding of workers in a sector , which is known for high turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose men , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you lose man , you lose also customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if you lose clients , then you will lose company .
the N@@ CAA eliminated the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the Bru@@ ins
it runs at 23 o &apos;clock when a lot of U@@ CL@@ A foot@@ ball@@ players are talking on one side of the new exercise fields of the team on campus .
some have gone out their fun@@ nel parts and show the back full of silence from the first day of training camp .
for a good part of the team , these un@@ equal minutes represent a lunch break .
players who are interested in the summer courses are going to return after the three @-@ hour exercise before they return on the next morning at 6 : 30 o &apos;clock to the Water@@ man Football Center .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is for the boys the next three days a real T@@ ret@@ mill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said before the Monday to Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CAA eliminated two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the load of players , and it has actually extended her days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three trainings of the U@@ CL@@ A should start at 19 : 15 in order to meet the already fully packed tim@@ ings of the players .
the com@@ promises gone from the two days is more than a day when the brood has moved almost a week after the last season and during the summer school during the first time during the summer school during Mor@@ as six hours during the summer school .
they should hold 18 exercises over the course of August 18 exercises . 20 before the start of the form@@ ations for their pre@@ lu@@ de against Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he under@@ took the control change of N@@ CAA support , even if they add a further point to the players .
&quot; we put this tremendous load three or four days on them , and it is very challenging , &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they simply hold it , they pl@@ agu@@ ed , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think once we come to Saturday and we will have more time , it &apos;s really great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U@@ CL@@ A will finish their practices as soon as the camp is completed , as soon as the camp is terminated by a adjacent parking place and the ad@@ joining Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the elevated class that has already been rejected with foot@@ paths , which is already a light task behind a door posts .
Bru@@ ins players will occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a dre@@ amed that there may be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; we will use our safety , &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem , and it &apos;s not far to think so the people rent a room and then set up there to record a exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the video from a exercise , it is a pretty good business .
but we have security forces there , and we have safety forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best , with what we have .
I don &apos;t make sure to worry about .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit messages
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with fal@@ cons of third parties and their results in the original contribution then said this is the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight f@@ ake News .
the company said in a statement on his website that it will begin with the use of updated machine @-@ learning methods to recogn@@ ise possible detection reports and show them to fact , the results of the fact test results from the original article .
Facebook was critic@@ ized as one of the main points for so @-@ called F@@ ake News , of which many believe that they have influenced the U.S. presidential election in 2016 .
the problem has become a major political topic in Europe , whereby the French voters were floo@@ ded in May with false stories , and Germany should not succeed to eliminate the social media networks as before the elections there quickly in September .
on Thursday , Facebook in a separate statement on German that in the US , France , the Netherlands and Germany , a test of the new facts can be launched .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to knowledge , what stories of fact exam@@ ines the third parties , people want to meet more context to meet these decisions regarding what they read and share , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sara Su , product man@@ ag@@ erin for Facebook messages in a blog . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook will continue to test his feature &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in conjunction with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; associated article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and further changes to its news feed to reduce wrong messages . &quot; &quot; &quot;
creating a Com@@ ic novel : a Castle in the History of England
in his younger past , the small Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squ@@ e@@ eze music video and was for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ he and 1980 @-@ er years .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of tur@@ bul@@ ent history of his comfortable seat in the wat@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and is now the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a mop@@ olitan Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a pre@@ ference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I find it so beautiful to look at the manuscript of someone who has been dead for 300 years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England covers the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documented the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . every story was illustrated by Isaac hand@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des , based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he was unexpected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had only responded to the thum@@ b @-@ print on the side of a letter , who was written by a double fighter in the 1700 &apos;s years that he worked for the Jac@@ o@@ bin@@ s , &quot; says he . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is his thum@@ b pressure !
and I always smell in smoke , because it was kindled a fire because of the light .
for someone who lives for 300 years later , the smell has a effect as it would even be too .
Oh , I love Archive ! &quot;
for someone who is so with old pap@@ ering , he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council of England , and almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be hon@@ est : I &apos;ve got a little over &quot; ) that seems to be true to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days to explore the Vict@@ orian &quot; new &quot; castle to study the archives and study many treasures and cur@@ ios@@ ities of the castle , as about the mon@@ ted hy@@ per heads in walls and bottles that had spent centuries in the grave .
he walked through the grounds and ruins of the old castle , and spoke with rural districts , g@@ athers and sometimes also worked with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then , at night he drank &quot; whis@@ key , and began to write . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the intimate story of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust received the full access in 2006 when the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey died .
when Rho@@ des met a decade later , the employees began to worry about the archive , which he said as &quot; hundreds of years , in which Arist@@ ok@@ rates told &quot; Oh , &quot; it described in the attic . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the time of the English Em@@ pi@@ res , maps , who had said : &quot; man could be bor@@ ing that land , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to have fought the two families .
guys , let everything go ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to spread on a wider basis into English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which leaves a man who leaves the newly built Castle of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a recording of a ri@@ ot that occurred in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book with the title &apos; Kn@@ igh@@ tly Famil@@ ies of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; says Rho@@ des . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pe@@ asant stand began in this area and I thought , an uprising was a good beginning . &quot; &quot; &quot;
maybe the two are linked together ? &quot;
other stories are firmly ro@@ oted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , who tells the history of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ rons , who had hidden the family Dar@@ rel@@ l seven years during the English re@@ formation .
or &apos; The Sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers &apos; in which the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l is represented in the 18th century , who filled his own Beer@@ se in which he filled a sar@@ g with stones ( a discovery which was built only years later when his sar@@ g was excav@@ ated ) .
the Dar@@ re@@ ll@@ s are Rho@@ des &apos;s favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gent@@ l@@ emen who is right to be able to make their debts and make money for things they could not aff@@ ord .
other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l @-@ men del@@ etes their school@@ ing cris@@ es , having rich old women married - I place them as a he@@ ap well @-@ looking boys , with a talent in order to advertise them within . &quot;
after the end of his use in the castle Rho@@ des is searching for other unique write experiences
he has brought a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish Wild@@ nis for a com@@ ic novel about El@@ em@@ än@@ m@@ ä@@ ki behind it , the terrain of a san@@ ction from the early 20th century , which has been returned from nature since then .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back again , &quot; says he .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to be finished again with the dam@@ nation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ u@@ elle placed in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the displacement of 301 years old Mari@@ u@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f launched her campaign to launch a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau of Thursday ) .
until Thursday , Mayor Otto N@@ EU@@ HO@@ FF and his marketing team to Nelson Art@@ z to keep the logo and the slogan .
at the end of August it is supposed to be a festi@@ vity of the campaign on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; to be beautiful for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the makers of the action has been on the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer chapel since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we think ( of course ! ) is not really &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; write it on their yesterday website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but we use this measure to win your attention .
and in order to make clear that it seems better than it seems .
basically , we are the permanent convic@@ tion that we know as Bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer citizens to know the beauty and attrac@@ tiv@@ eness of our city very well . &quot;
in the promotion , it will go to more than &quot; a logo and a slogan , it is going to continue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true to form@@ ulate a stand@@ able promise that gives the city an un@@ mist@@ ak@@ able property . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally , they arise in the competition with other municipalities .
a medium five @-@ digit amount will be the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f their new umbrella brand and the campaign cost .
military re@@ forms in Turkey - Erd@@ og@@ an fear of the army
every year at the beginning of August in Ankara of the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ as ) on pension funds and convey@@ ors in the army cor@@ ps .
so this week .
at first sight a normal process .
but nothing is routine with the Turkish forces a year after the coup attempt .
the meeting took place no more in the building of the General Staff , as previously , but in the office of the Prime Minister .
under the presi@@ dency of Government now also the five Vi@@ enn@@ re@@ mier@@ s , as well as the Minister for Defence , Interior , Justice and Foreign Affairs .
so they were civilians in the y@@ as .
the government attrac@@ ts the bre@@ aches in the military .
General Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the Com@@ man@@ ure of the host , the Air Force , and the Navy have been out@@ set .
since the failed Cou@@ p , head of Staff Erd@@ og@@ an 169 of 326 gener@@ als and ad@@ mir@@ als were fired .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - usually because of alleged connections to the movement of the exile @-@ pre@@ stige Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , the Erd@@ og@@ an as a wire of the coup .
against 486 people who have been involved in the coup attempt , this week is negoti@@ ated in Ankara since this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the day after the coup attempt , Erd@@ og@@ an was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; God &apos;s gift &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as he had to give him the opportunity to clean the forces &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but does Erd@@ og@@ an has really become the army in the handle ?
at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet published an article entitled &quot; Un@@ aming &quot; in the military headquarters . &quot;
in the General Staff , there is lack of concern because of an increasing &quot; Islamic &quot; of the army , which explained among others in the repe@@ aling of the head of the head of the soldier , wrote the newspaper .
the large cle@@ aring in the army and security forces goes further .
in mid @-@ July , Erd@@ og@@ an sent another 73@@ 95 Heads of State , among them 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 546 soldiers .
it seemed to be pe@@ og@@ ni@@ an to the military .
gener@@ als earlier than the real gent@@ l@@ emen of the country .
three times p@@ ush@@ es her to her role as a gu@@ ardi@@ ans of world state regulations .
after his election victory in 2002 , Erd@@ og@@ an ur@@ ged the power of the military step by step , not least in calling to the reform of the European Union .
former officers say , Erd@@ og@@ an imp@@ acted a Islam@@ isation of forces .
in the magazine &quot; Voc@@ al Europe &quot; war@@ ned a well @-@ called officer , who sought for asylum from persecution abroad , the Turkish army will be full of extreme extrem@@ ists and Sal@@ af@@ ists in a few years .
it meets that NATO could not leave NATO for such a development .
in the alliance , there are doub@@ ts in the alliance after the pur@@ ities of the Turkish army .
the management structures and operational skills are &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; NATO diplom@@ ats . &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
there will be a new US immig@@ ration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , President Donald Tr@@ ump , quoted from the media .
he sees to lower legal immig@@ rants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter regulations for the issu@@ ance of visa for a temporary work permit and limitations for families @-@ oriented visa .
the new rules are proposed by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , save wages and billions of dollars for the tax@@ pay@@ ers and will do this by how the U.S. will be exported to the citizens from other countries Green Cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent the chains migration and replace the current system .
this new applic@@ ant procedure is coming to the candidate to support the candidates that have the financial funds to support themselves and knowledge of our economy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted from the American media .
Ministry of race track shuttle
again , in the past months , over the future of the rac@@ use of the race , it is supposed to go very quickly .
before the end of the year , the track that goes to the tourist bus is to be built .
to secure the future of the race platform for long term , according to the traffic of the traffic in this year , construction work will start at the route .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to order the route Ilmenau @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the country is particularly important for tourism important connection , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated traffic State Secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Erfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs for the maintenance of the track decreased to about 2.5 million euros .
out of this sum , the country is 75 percent .
the contract , based on which the shuttle should also be ordered in the future of the country , I will definitely be voted , declared S@@ üh@@ l .
the Ministry and South Mor@@ ning Train as operators are already one of the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the road@@ map that tra@@ ded vehicles and quality standards , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
the racing shuttle service should be regular to regular service on December 2017 .
the race track shuttle is one of the popular railway connection between the Ilmenau and Renn@@ stei@@ g railway stations .
in the past months , in the course of a pilot project , the distance of sufficient many people have been used to order back in the future .
the route is also very di@@ lap@@ id@@ ated in parts .
the Asc@@ ent of Sex robots is real , and we should worry about it
just as you thought it is not yet crazy , a new report about the technological developments in the field of sex robot .
yes , indeed .
sex robot are currently a great thing .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for responsible Robotics ) ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , emer@@ itus , Professor of Robotics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we have to start to take their climb .
customers can choose the eyel@@ ash of the robot , its form of the ni@@ pp@@ le and the type of fing@@ ern@@ a@@ gel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people are fun on them , but the company provide any quantity thereof , and we will get much more likely to see , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Shar@@ key said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Shar@@ key on the publication of his new report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have developed by their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a Sil@@ ic@@ con@@ ina who feels warm - with aware human reactions to be achieved by artificial intelligence .
the user can also custom@@ ize its robots according to its belie@@ fs , &quot; and do everything that select from the eyel@@ ids of the robot about the form of chest warning to the type or color of his fing@@ ern@@ ails .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there will still be troubled when many robots own the &quot; personal@@ ities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who would look like a Step@@ ford @-@ woman progressive &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have developed to robots with a silicone fo@@ res@@ kin .
the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot allows for example its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they are appe@@ aling as for example .
and then there was the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold sex robot with pre @-@ programmed personal@@ ities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which convey@@ s the impression of rel@@ ent@@ ness and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with a &quot; derived &quot; personality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that has been adapted as good as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the website of True Compan@@ ion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so you like what you like , and it does not like what you like , etc .
in the course of the day , she also has their voices - quite like real people !
it can be tired , fixed on conversation or can be &quot; in the mood ! &quot;
there are many troubled aspects of this asc@@ ension of sex robots - not least , because they are real human relationships - but the sub@@ mitting female properties that goes on rape if one goes to a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( is here : resi@@ ding ) Far@@ rah , un@@ quiet one at most .
on his website true True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; when women ( sic ) have a vibr@@ ator , why can men have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &apos; is it on the site .
however , these sex robots are not only one fat or content just another sex lighter .
their origin and growing refin@@ ement indicate a little dar@@ ker and deeper in our culture , to a withdrawal of the Ideal for Gender equality in a desire after sex with sub@@ jug@@ ation as optional enc@@ ore .
most men do not realize any sex robot , and while the FR@@ R notice its rising popularity , they still remain pre@@ limin@@ arly in the edge of the consumer culture .
but what is le@@ ak@@ ened out of the bound@@ ary zones , in relation to the spirit of time , in which we live , very teaching .
and many people are not strange , or anim@@ ate , until they are the free market for permission .
there is a certain over@@ l@@ apping that this highly developed sex robot in a time appeared in which the rights of women are threatened worldwide , in which in the White House there is a president who gave them sexual violence against women .
the aw@@ ful aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the handmaid &apos; ) are not the graphic pictures , the swal@@ low body and the cast eyes , but as realistic this vision .
the Republic of Gilead is a jump but at the moment it feels like a big jump .
the goal behind these sex robots exists , a physical simil@@ arity to real women as realistic as technically possible ( if also with por@@ no@@ star propor@@ tions ) .
her maker want to feel that they feel human body to im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
but , in the point when it goes around their &quot; personal@@ ities , &quot; the robots do not represent any real women .
they can not be separated from their companion or simply go away .
they have no placement or background history , nothing what in independence or anything indicates what the imagination could distur@@ b the imagination .
differently expressed : they are f@@ ake slaves .
or to express it in the spe@@ ech@@ es of 2017 : service ma@@ ids
tr@@ um@@ ps great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney for intu@@ ition of healthy lives
it is become a b@@ ins@@ en@@ we@@ eit era of the tr@@ ump era , that the political sp@@ ades that have the U.S. elec@@ torate @-@ reflective photoelectric sensor , also have families in small size .
around Christmas and Ern@@ t@@ ed@@ ank@@ fest there were newspapers in the USA newspapers with advice about how to handle the hor@@ ror of Tr@@ ump selectable relatives .
we all supp@@ os@@ edly give us all of them to let our filter fl@@ es .
less , the power of Tr@@ um@@ ps , families have been noted .
I chose this because my c@@ ousin , a left @-@ oriented did@@ act , who lives in Chicago and has long been a long time with the rep@@ ublic@@ ans in our family , this week in New York .
it remin@@ ded me that unity against a common enemy can have a mighty effect .
with tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone who knows it , including the republi@@ can relationship , with which she had fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and quite independent on the same site .
in order to find the dining table certainly a good thing , but it falls to me in a further context that this also brings considerable risks with itself .
the Left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the issu@@ ing effect of his presi@@ dency has the power to slide us all right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we speak of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and tr@@ ump , we refer to the gr@@ us@@ el@@ ly possibility that his M@@ itt@@ ens will not stum@@ ble . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , there is still an unprecedented long @-@ time scenario , in the Tr@@ ump Rep@@ ublic@@ ans of the right wing &quot; norm@@ alized , &quot; which appeared in comparison to his standards as an in@@ compreh@@ ension of desp@@ air .
I found myself today by an active nost@@ al@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ antic version of the return - the 14 % income tax ( but at least did we see how his tax declaration saw ) - both in comparison to tr@@ ump in fact it occurs as a very mild Criminal rates .
if Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of the Republi@@ can only be spiritu@@ ally healthy to qualify as an indisp@@ utable improvement .
when my cou@@ sine in the city was , we brought our children to Kar@@ us@@ sell in Central Park , the largest of the Kar@@ uss@@ ers of New York Park@@ department , and the best three dollars which you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need caffeine .
the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are cris@@ y and the animals are turning to look full of anxi@@ ety about their own shoul@@ ders - extremely dark and the climate per@@ sever@@ ing music .
so many sounds of a city is disappointed : the views of high buildings are old , the Sky@@ lines are familiar to offer , and the reality of the city shall not be justified .
five @-@ five years later , and I &apos;m still not all over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss Cottage - the topic pub ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not - but a large roundabout in the north of London .
however , Central Park Kar@@ us@@ sell is still a strange magical experience , as here two two years , a 11 year old and two women in the 40 @-@ ies can go on it and all have a great time .
if I could rate the car@@ ou@@ sel , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one has asked .
on the other hand , I was forced to rate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of up to five stars before I could pass through my credit card .
in the coffee machine on the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to pay by a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the load .
this does not only lead to a slow@@ down of what actually should be a neutral exchange , but also does pressure on the server to enter into a situation in which no need is necessary .
the poor woman in the department store stood innocent , while I tired the experience to submit my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us with chest pain from prison to the hospital
Pist@@ ori@@ us has left the prison for a hospital visit for the second time .
last year , he was brought to the hospital for the treatment of his hands to the hospital , which he suffered from prison authorities , according to a fall in his cell .
Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to death in murder after an appeal of the prosec@@ uting attor@@ neys .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning hours of Valentine &apos;s morning by taking them several times by a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ t@@ oria on them .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his gir@@ l@@ friend for a n@@ igh@@ tly penetration that was hidden in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors announced their intention to submit this time against the six @-@ year sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , of whom they say , it be too dense .
the National Prosec@@ ution Authority stated that it shall be transferred to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the obj@@ ection could be heard this year .
Pist@@ ori@@ us runs danger that his sentence is increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .

software update for diesel vehicles : what those people have to know now
how exactly will the software update take place ?
have diesel drivers must participate in action ?
key questions and answers within a glance .
BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW @-@ Group software updates are offered for a total of approximately 5.3 million cars in total .
they are to improve exhaust gas behaviour of cars from Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are excluded .
Anja S@@ met@@ anin by ACE Auto Club Europa has been rated :
is the new action mandatory ?
no , the handled software updates are voluntary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mandatory updates are only valid for the vehicles that have been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the re@@ arm@@ ament was arranged at the Federal Office of the Federal Office ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
the manufacturers have announced a fast implementation in the next few months , but no exact date is known .
Daimler has informed us to write any data subject .
if I want to be paid in an inspection , it will be done in their frame .
how long will the change@@ ability to go up ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin .
the curtains of the commitment of the manufacturer as well as from the political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for we have seen , voluntary manufacturers do not deal with the environment during the environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long shall the update last ?
the conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ up could be to get an appointment .
what are driving drivers that do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?
the ACE should be waiting for .
presumably , foreign manufacturers would follow , as S@@ met@@ anin .
is there a massive price reduction of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE fears that .
but just in the regions , where drivers are above .
in rural areas there is no impair@@ ment losses for older diesel .
the ACE av@@ enge with a sale yet to wait .

we do the city li@@ fel@@ ong
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Urban Builder , goes to the next year in R@@ ente .
the site is already written - suitable applications are ra@@ r .
W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ d for 31 years .
and the work still makes him great fun , as he medi@@ ates in the press talk .
it reports varied , but also challenging tasks that wait for its successor .
at the same time , it &apos;s ad@@ mi@@ red that no application was fulfilled .
the city is looking for the next possible time a architects or construction engineer .
thus - under the cont@@ emp@@ t of regular management times - still enough time for a preparation .
da Has@@ lach has been responsible for the administrative community as a sub@@ jection of building authority , the applic@@ ants must be prescribed by the applic@@ ants .
for this function wants to keep the city in any case .
if they could not fill out this more , the citizens would have to travel until Offen@@ burg .
but the proximity to the city and himself is important , says W@@ acker that reported from a good operating climate as well as good mood between authority and citizens .
in more than 30 years of office , some important projects were gathered , looking back to the W@@ acker with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city li@@ fel@@ ong , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is thinking about the building office and its employees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but even in the future , varied projects on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a areas and the low @-@ floor parking lot is about .
the chin @-@ over bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the st@@ adi@@ ums are still subject .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter will propose to be@@ ech approximately 1.5 million euros , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do it right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; all in all , great tasks are waiting for my successor .
the work here makes fun . &quot;
design is present for a city master of large games room .
with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s own building yard and man@@ oeu@@ vre could be flexi@@ bly respon@@ ding to multiple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one can move a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker , and the design of the green plants are often mentioned by citizens and visitors often . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the old town is known as a ensemble , it is important to have &quot; an eye for that which fits &quot; if new buildings will be approved , emphas@@ ises the new Stadt@@ bau@@ d .
oh@@ ar bears high responsibility for the city &apos;s city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is building , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end everything goes on my table here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with care and coordination he can count on many years of experience : Markus Neum@@ ai@@ er ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been in existence since ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( deep construction ) has been in charge for 15 years .
also that his success@@ ors remain long , W@@ acker : &quot; we are looking for someone who really identified with the spot . &quot;
for continu@@ ity is not only important for a good operating climate , but also for the further design of the city .
he who wants to inherit Roland W@@ acker should have completed his studies as a diploma engineer or Bachelor with specialist architecture as a diploma engineer or Bachelor with specialist architecture in the areas of construction and planning law .
building construction , construction planning , building planning , Gr@@ under@@ wer@@ age policy , management planning , urban building farm with building yard and municipal court and sub@@ jection protection , including monument protection .

according to the police , the blue bicycle from the railway track was over@@ thrown in the area of Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) to the lines .
these were so strongly damaged that the her@@ eto@@ ing freight train had to be observed .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male perpet@@ rators and search for the night hours after them .
close to the facts , a thr@@ ott@@ le bike and bike driver had been observed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is far beyond a Laus@@ anno@@ ying kingdom , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ö@@ BB spokes@@ person Christoph Pos@@ ch said to A@@ PA . &quot; &quot; &quot;
who or the perpet@@ rators have been brought into great danger and also end@@ anger@@ ed train traffic .
in addition to the damage to the Lo@@ k and the plant and the delay of late @-@ minutes and the cost of rail traffic could also be added to the perpet@@ rators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a total of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; considerable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damages were fixed on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the south route could be guided without disabilities .
almost ten personnel were dropped Friday morning , two of them are the correspondence .
freight trains did not exist , but they didn &apos;t delay .
according to Ö@@ BB spokes@@ person , Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be exchanged around 200 meters of upper lines .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts have been damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate might help , IB@@ D ( infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory bo@@ wel disease )
red flesh and chocolate can sound your digest@@ ive system like a night@@ mare .
but a new study claimed exactly the contrary : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , the symptoms of patients with infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory bo@@ wel diseases .
the im@@ pet@@ able condition that affects approximately 1.3 million and in Britain 300,000 , caused mag@@ nets and fl@@ aps , recur@@ ring or bloody attacks , weight loss and extreme ti@@ red@@ ness .
while the interested parties normally meet , meat and dairy products found to avoid their symptoms , researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an of proteins were to develop immun@@ ity to develop a toler@@ ant intest@@ ines .
the leader researchers , Dr. Marco Colonna , declared that immune cells in the intest@@ ine pat@@ rol to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide themselves in the body , not enter into the body .
cells that are able to resolve inflamm@@ ation , are balanced of cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without sensitive t@@ issues .
when balance is tend to inflamm@@ ation in the direction of inflamm@@ ation , it can result in a infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory effects .
in experiments were determined that there is a type of tolerance dependent immune cell in mice that carry a certain bacter@@ ium in their bow@@ els .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an - one of the building blocks of proteins - to resolve the appearance of the cells .
Professor Colonna said : &quot; we have a connection between a bacter@@ ien@@ art - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ illus reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the intest@@ inal micro@@ bi@@ ans , and the development of a population of cells which promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an the mice had in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
it struck that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and one of tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an rich nutrition toler@@ ates , less anti @-@ infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory mil@@ ie@@ us , if the same system also wir@@ t with people .
the post @-@ doctoral studies in Dr. Lu@@ isa Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan under@@ took a kind of immune cell which found the tolerance when they found that a group of study mice had such cells , but a different group of the same tribe that had been separated , that had not been separated .
they suspected that the difference was to do with the intest@@ inal micro@@ bi@@ omen of mice , viruses and fung@@ i , usually live in the stomach @-@ intest@@ inal tract .
the mice of mice were found DNA sequ@@ enz@@ es and were found six bacter@@ ias which were present in mice with the immune cells , but without them were missing in mice .
mice were removed in an steril@@ ization environment , so that they were missing a intest@@ inal micro@@ bi@@ om and they did not developed these kind of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
in order to understand how the bacteria increased to the immune system , the researchers fed L. reu@@ ter@@ i to grow into a liquid - without the bacteria - without the bacteria - on un@@ ripe immune cells that were isolated from mice .
immun@@ ity cells developed to toler@@ ant cells .
when the active component of the liquid was cleaned , it proved to be a side @-@ product of tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an Met@@ abol@@ ism that is known as In@@ do@@ l @-@ 3 @-@ Mil@@ ig@@ ic acid .
if the researchers fed the amount of tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an in the food of the mice , the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent , but if the tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an values were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan declared that people have the same toler@@ ant cells such as mice , and that most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i protect themselves in our stomach @-@ intest@@ ines .
it is not known if Tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an @-@ side products made from L. reu@@ ter@@ i the cells of people like in mice , but defects in relation to tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an were found in humans with anti @-@ infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory effects .
she said , &quot; The development of this cells is probably something that we want to promote , since these cells are inflamm@@ ation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine .
potential tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i lead to a expansion of this population . &quot;

the 40 million pounds signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEFA Cup game begins on Tuesday , and impressive in the holder role , as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira .
however , M@@ atic was excluded from the preparatory Asia tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes to improve the Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho that he had to improve before the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time but his experience , intelligence , a gen@@ ius in the kind , how he think - he th@@ inks football , &quot; said Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho .
&quot; we will help him to be ready before . &quot;
in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u at Avi@@ va stadium , as Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho his start @-@ XI for the beginning of the season .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three of four , for that I have added to the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happy if they get four of four , but they have given great trav@@ ail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; painted &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the US plane producer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pilots flew from Seattle in the U.S. state Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in US State Michigan and moved to the form of a Dream@@ liner over the United States , which are several thousand kilometers .
the action took 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar , the form of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers was to be .
the whole was a cardio test for new engines .
Boeing had already made such advertising earlier .
so the number &quot; 787 &quot; and the Boeing logo was painted into the sky .
new underground for Martin Schulz - Hannover , we have a problem
as the wind revol@@ ves : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still on the SPD boss , the S &amp; D Prime Minister were always settled with a certain concern in Berlin .
naked no distur@@ b@@ ance from the party headquarters , merely no opposite wind from the covenant - the most important desire of the election fighting .
since Martin Schulz has been the party , the fundament@@ ally has changed .
since then , the employees of the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus with an aston@@ ishment of an aston@@ ishment in the SPD &apos;s state capit@@ als .
what Schulz has been from there since the beginning of the year , would not be described with counter@@ wind in the approach .
there were deep suggestions .
and one after the others .
according to the end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal Republic of Lower Saxony sees a general signal against Ko@@ al@@ itions of SPD and Gre@@ ens .
&quot; this shows even more : red @-@ green is simply not reliable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CDU Secretary General Peter Tau@@ ber , &quot; &quot; &quot; said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said CDU Secretary Peter Tau@@ ber dem editor Network ( R@@ ND ) .
the surprising fra@@ ction of a Green @-@ M@@ EP@@ s has over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) in a severe crisis .
five months before the Parliament election , his red @-@ green Coalition lost their A @-@ vote majority to the opposition from the CDU and F@@ DP .
the Green Party Leader Michael Kell@@ ner sent the ab@@ hor@@ red @-@ Sax@@ on Green Party El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets to ad@@ mit her mandate .
the over@@ comes to the CDU means a clear f@@ ake of voters .
El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets must immediately return al@@ at once , &quot; said the Federal Managing Director and elec@@ toral campaign of the Green Network Deutschland ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this may not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he sigh@@ ted a SPD election , than on Friday morning the new Hi@@ ob@@ s@@ Message reaches the party headquarters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Weil , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , is located after the over@@ coming of the green MPs El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets to the CDU without his own government multilingual .
it is the provisional highlight of all the rows of large and small cris@@ es in the SPD state associations .
and no one knows what is coming next .
the missions began with the unexpected defeat at the Saarland election in March .
a blue eye , no more , based on the com@@ ra@@ des .
everything will be different after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia .
that was then - and indeed , everything was worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the de@@ mar@@ bles that Düsseldorf @-@ Ple@@ ite destroyed the party .
the com@@ ra@@ des turned back up again in the weeks after that .
then , when they had just had new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg .
and with him the next low@@ ance came .
Mayor O@@ la@@ f Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD landing , lost his Nim@@ bus in that weekend , because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city burned .
and because he did so in the crisis communication so pretty anything wrong , what you can do wrong .
since then Sch@@ olz fought for his political survival .
now Stephan Weil now also .
due to the VW @-@ emission aff@@ air and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Lower Saxony Prime Minister has already been in criticism in criticism .
Mi@@ ese re@@ fra@@ ction came to .
nevertheless , or perhaps just therefore , because in the past few weeks , Weil tried to set acc@@ ents in acc@@ ents .
the purch@@ aser of the former civil Master of Hanover , his power in Berlin , was not hidden in the field of Martin Schulz .
they let him grant him because they spoke of the party &apos;s stabil@@ ization of the party .
now the exact opposite can occur .
in this case , because there is no fault at the part@@ iti@@ y of the world , that is no gu@@ ilt in the world .
and Schulz not even at all .
at that time , the com@@ ra@@ des should therefore be closed to hold its own rows .
her anger is aimed at the green , and here especially on the ab@@ stain@@ ed par@@ li@@ ament@@ arians in T@@ jack@@ ets .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and demo@@ c@@ lical , such as Mrs. T@@ jack@@ sch , &quot; says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , CEO of Part@@ eil@@ ines in the SPD Bundestag &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the editorial network Deutschland ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ms. T@@ jack@@ ets were not elected to Parliament for their person as a direct di@@ dat@@ in , but on the country &apos;s country @-@ Sax@@ on Green Party .
the logical consequence would it be that she returns to her mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , Chief of the SPD Bundestag , compl@@ ained an &quot; un@@ democratic man@@ oeu@@ vre . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the elec@@ tor of four years ago was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people did Stephan Weil for the Prime Minister &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who led the Lower Saxony SPD as a peak candidate in the Bundestag election , the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the personal career comm@@ enting of a future CDU de@@ mark , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he asked to clari@@ fy the back@@ grounds .
I want to know if there has been more or more information about the CDU Lower Saxony .
convey@@ ors of the nu@@ cle@@ us III
who wish to renov@@ ate it into the years , can be received from the country soon .
in addition , Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives of Ste@@ ering Urban Development on Wednesday was found in sensation .
at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ in@@ dler had once again looking back a look at the so far .
since 1991 , it has been present in Sens@@ es Sec@@ tions .
at that time , in the san@@ itation region I from 1991 to 2004 , the country Baden @-@ Württemberg has taken over two thirds of the funding amount .
in the renovation of the II between 2005 and 2016 , the surplus was still 60 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Sch@@ in@@ dler , the previous species are a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; success &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - it is finally important to promote interior development , not only new construction areas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on April 4 , I have received the information from the government of Karlsruhe to give information a san@@ itation region III .
the funding amount is 8@@ 33 333 euros , of which are 500 000 Euro from the land , the rest of the municipality sensation .
how does a san@@ e area arises ?
one will continue to investigate so ch@@ in@@ dler , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are .
but it also plays an role , whether in the planned area at all , you are interested in .
if necessary , the area could continue to move again once again .
the steak came on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
cell@@ ars presented the contents of the federal state program &quot; Social City , &quot; in whose framework the San@@ ings would then be carried out .
the core of the program are the Rev@@ it@@ alization of the inner @-@ education , improving the living and working conditions and the expansion of infrastructure .
the measures would be obj@@ ection to object , which is called per plot , is carried out .
then the san@@ itation area would eventually set as a statute .
the certificate period for funding has been running since January 1 , 2017 until April 30 , 20@@ 26 .
however , until September of this year , however , only once the inventory was carried out , within the framework of those involved a questionnaire to fill a questionnaire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in November or December , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should be made possible by the pro@@ vocation , that in the coming year &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can be started . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann announced that every community had to carry out the common preliminary investigations .
it is therefore to evaluate and decide to evaluate the urban@@ isation and decide when , and in which volume .
there will be a san@@ itation in the land register for the respective plot .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann himself will come again after reading and make a picture of the location , she promised them .
Got@@ zel stressed a substantial success factor for the project is the participation of the parties .
therefore , there will be questionn@@ aires that are sent to citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled until the end of the summer holidays .
the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; building and bound@@ ary bow , &quot; which is among other things around the build condition and the rehabilitation views .
in the grey questionnaire , the &quot; House@@ hold and Resi@@ dential bow , &quot; can be made information about size , spl@@ itting and residents of a residential area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; company arc &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is only sufficient to fill in the building business premises . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , in fact , Got@@ zel proved that a full questionnaire did not apply a request for funding at the same time .
furthermore , new construction measures will not be eligible .
Sch@@ in@@ dler stressed that the distribution of convey@@ ors after the &quot; wind farm principle &quot; was working - who first comes , m@@ ah@@ lt first .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you cannot reserve &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; support for later &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; finally , photos of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; village II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were shown to make a restoration &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
British inventor himself sets a micro@@ chip to come with a hand@@ movement in house and car
a British inventor is the first in the country , which is equipped with a micro@@ chip , so that he can enter his own door , and can even start with a manual movement .
Steven North@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thum@@ bs and hands and now offers the service for businesses and individuals who want to simpli@@ fy their lives with technology through his company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he has joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , a consult@@ ative an@@ a@@ esth@@ ists in the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , together to ensure that the im@@ plant procedure is carried out according to medical standard .
the technology resem@@ bles a cats and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and takes only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. North@@ am wants to change the castles at houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , everything for a surcharge of £ 300 per lock .
the married father of one has now built both at home and his BMW Z4 technology , which starts when his hand is at the tax .
the advertising costs of the White House cost the tax@@ pay@@ er thousands
the decision of the White House , a n@@ avy @-@ helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event which raises American production in the last month , costs tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the information of the military that were transferred to the TI@@ ME magazine , up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars .
the green white S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the President is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American building programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and Chief Prosecutor of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries .
the helicopter was made in Connecticut with a fire@@ man of Ma@@ ine , a fire@@ man car from Wisconsin and a forkli@@ ft from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
the military office of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ ment@@ ary order or FRA@@ GO , hardly 36 hours before the helicopter on the South La@@ wn , after the records of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 ) , the unit which is responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just wanted to be aware of this because it is an unusual event of high visibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the Commander of the H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 on the eve of the event before his superior , the deputy Marin@@ ek@@ om@@ man@@ de@@ ur for aviation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the message showed that the helicopter arrived at the South La@@ wn at 7 : 00 in the morning , and so long stayed until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening .
the note adds that if departure from the White House should be delayed , due to the limitation of service hours a second crew would be needed .
during the event during the event during the helicopter , while security personnel remained at the plane during the period during the time .
the records presented at the TI@@ ME was not clear if ultimately , a second flight crew was necessary .
the Hatch Act has set the federal state to use state property for political purposes .
data sets show that H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 asked if the event could viol@@ ate the determination .
&quot; a question that we found whether it was a violation of the Hatch acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the commander .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sounds when you are shut up , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; answered the Deputy Commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was designated as the official event and was not covered by the Hatch Act .
but the official events have political upper tones .
at the event , the President had a violation of the reform of health reform that was in the Senate in the G@@ ange , and he prop@@ ag@@ ated the efforts to regul@@ ating the government regulations .
the use of aircraft , which is known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon .
President are obliged to use them for the journey .
but use only for a photo @-@ OP , is unusual .
Tr@@ ump conducted an investigation as the presidential plane in February , when the presidential plane in the background of his first Kamp@@ ag@@ nen@@ r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that compl@@ aining about the use of the presidential aircraft through its predecessor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House is impressed by the show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made In America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 states will be made by American workers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the Deputy Press@@ ing of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 crew often lead training flights in the area around Washington and South La@@ wn in order to increase the US President in the White House with precise centimeters .
when Tr@@ ump was at the beginning of July at the G20 summit in Germany , H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 conducted in the White House 58 exercise districts .
the flight for the &quot; Made in America &quot; Event counted at the training requirement of the flight crew for the month , said a civil servants .
Hel@@ ik@@ op@@ ter units flew to an additional 11 hours to this day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support . &quot;
the White House said that the tax@@ pay@@ ers were last for any of the other re@@ is@@ itions that were presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man from S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky said that the company was not involved in the South of La@@ wn .
H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 does not include Bud@@ get@@ ed drawings for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to St@@ und@@ ent@@ ari@@ zation of the US Ministry of Defence for the financial year 2017 , the Do@@ D replacement kit for the V@@ H @-@ 3D , however , 24.@@ 380 USD per flight .
records of the unit list the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House argu@@ ed that the actual costs for the operation of the helicopter are far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the costs for tax@@ pay@@ ers on the basis of estimates of the organization is highly ir@@ re@@ leader , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs which are included in the annual funding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a RA@@ ND study from the year 2015 , the ship@@ ments for Do@@ D does not include personnel costs but consider the cost of fuel , maintenance and contract .
at that time , the former pressing pre@@ cher of the White House , S@@ ean Sp@@ aces , the use of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; the idea is to present these week things , which are produced in America , &quot; said Sp@@ are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know that S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and the state of Connecticut are very proud to contribute to our national security , and I go out that hundreds , if not even thousands of people depend on it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think like most of the Americans are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment , for which many Americans have un@@ ti@@ relessly worked .
it is of course appropriate to raise it . &quot;
it was not clear if Tr@@ ump was inter@@ ned with the helicopter , when he entered his tour about the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the seat of a fire brig@@ ade .
in the White House Tr@@ ump said to representatives of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and scher@@ sleben with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky very good , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;

roll back@@ wards : the town is 46 cooking facilities
the city organizes the K@@ ita @-@ lunch itself again .
with fixed partners for children and a assignment to the team .
in the urban kinder@@ garten , the clock is turned back .
on September 1 , the city of Kre@@ feld takes over the essence of food care in the urban nurs@@ ery facilities ( Kit@@ as ) again .
for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , Deputy Head of youth welfare , is that good news : &quot; we all pleased with us . &quot;
it remains bo@@ iled except house : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and provides fresh bo@@ iled cooled .
the city runs in the fields of 46 kinder@@ garten sites , in 44 children receive a warm meal .
in the last Kit@@ a@@ year , 2800 children were at the tables , and the need is growing steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only children who are taken care of 45 lessons are taken , in the K@@ ita at noon , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour supervision when children up to 14 pm . &quot;
46 particles from September 1 , kitchen service : they heat the delivered food , supplement them to salad , raw food and fruit , por@@ tion@@ ate the meal individually , give food from , cleaning , rinse and clean the kitchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employees are assigned to a K@@ ita &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ ance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the size - there are two @-@ group @-@ group@@ ed facilities - decides about the ho@@ ur@@ ly range .
&quot; the kitchen staff now belong to the K@@ ita team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz satisfied .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much stronger and it is easier to implement ped@@ agog@@ ical concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because it &apos;s your way : healthy nutrition and cooking lessons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the children shall help to prepare food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen power of the team is to be meaning@@ ful .
also for the children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have a well @-@ known force in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar with them , and not changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this continu@@ ity is important for children .
the pur@@ ge of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - so far as the task of kitchen forces - is done in the future of special cleaning agents .
this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - beside the quality improvement of the kitchen power , it also has the charm of the kitchen power , which they set out in cost @-@ comparison between own rule and foreign policy for the city as the most economic situation , it is called the Press Office .
and that , although 46 sub@@ tim@@ ings will be newly set .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours fall at around 750 people in the educational area not so strong in weight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afghan democracy depends on political role of women , says the UN
elections can only be representative if all members of the company , including women , a role , said the Chief of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ s@@ om , director of the Mission of the United Nations , said that hundreds of women are di@@ versi@@ fied in the provinces in the provinces of the United Nations . three women is di@@ vin@@ ation for the role of Vice President and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
elections can only really be representative and cre@@ dible , if women are un@@ restricted in all parts of the election process .
Afghan elections for the provincial Council and the presidential election will take place on April 5 .
the Taliban have published thre@@ ats against an election process that coinci@@ des with the transition of international mar@@ tial arts to a consult@@ ative role .
this year the elections for the first time , the elections will pass the power peace@@ fully by a democr@@ atically elected government .
Hay@@ s@@ om said , a strong role for women will still strengthen the democratic success of Afghanistan .
the Afghan National Commission reported that 1.2 million women were registered with a total of 3.6 million voters .

G@@ MB concern about investments in the Mc@@ Vit@@ ia factory in Glasgow
a union would like to make a union for managers of the Bis@@ c@@ ite manufacturer Mc@@ Vit@@ ia on long @-@ term commitment to production in their plant in Glasgow .
G@@ MB Scotland said that the company was silent for the future of investing in the T@@ oll@@ cross site .
more than 500 employees work in the plant , besides other products Hob@@ no@@ bs and R@@ ich Tea K@@ ek@@ se .
Mc@@ V@@ ities owner Pl@@ adi@@ s said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
he added that employees and trade union representatives &quot; would be &quot; as the first experienced &quot; to change their activities .
in a letter to the company called the company called G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vit@@ ie &apos;s , &quot; concerns , &quot; concerns that financing is not advanced to moderni@@ zation of production lines . &quot;
G@@ MB Senior organizer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; the fact that we cannot win any clarity of business requirements and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross .
generations of families have been working here and workers focus on the local community and the Greater Glasgow , an important pillar for de@@ cent employment in an area of high unemployment and social dis@@ advant@@ age@@ ous .
therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wage and prosper@@ ity , and in front of the background of Bre@@ x@@ ite , the increasing life administrative costs and the chronic production process , the eastern end of Glasgow ur@@ gently need a flor@@ ent production process at Mc@@ Vit@@ ia . &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of Pl@@ adi@@ s said : &quot; the Fili@@ ale manager at T@@ oll@@ cross has won a letter of G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will react directly to them , as we estimate the continuous commitment of employees and trade union representatives .
two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were open .
we discussed the employees that we operate as all companies that are in an extremely competitive @-@ intensive and un@@ certain economic climate , our business cycle and the same applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive .
she added : &quot; in recent years we invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross site , particularly in production lines and operative improvements .
we recognize the inheritance of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production site and completely on . to change our operational processes at the location , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to learn this . &quot;
has the PS@@ G Barcelona war@@ ned three years before Ne@@ ym@@ ar ?
the side of La Liga may your interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Germain had not left in their persecution by Ne@@ ym@@ ar , after having appro@@ ached an offer of £ 189 million to resolve his release cl@@ ause , but they war@@ ned at Barcelona three years ago ?
the sensational approach will be heated in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than the double of the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ ba in the past season for 89 million pounds as Manchester United returned .
after completion , Ne@@ ym@@ ar is the most expensive players in the world and the most paid professional sports@@ men in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is w@@ alled about the way , such as Ne@@ ym@@ ar has given its way to outside , although a source near the Catal@@ ans executive board insi@@ sted that the club has always given its best to take care of him from Santos in 2013 to take care of him .
but the football world was war@@ ned by the PS@@ G President three years ago ?
when Manchester City met interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ i@@ di &apos;s signature , Nasser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for everyone , who wanted to sign one of the best player from PS@@ G .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not concerned because they will touch one of our players , then we will contact them in opposition to them , we will contact their player &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to sign one of our players at sign , this consequences will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have exceeded this line with the Spanish association at the beginning of this summer interest in the PS@@ G middle field player Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti .
PS@@ G clearly made it that they would not allow to travel to the International from Italy under any circumstances and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by taking part in their price list for Ne@@ ym@@ ar .

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report dis@@ last@@ et Pope John R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Domain report on the abuse of the Pope John R@@ atz@@ inger .
this is the author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the failure sc@@ and@@ al at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen ensures discussions .
Christian Assem@@ ble , spokes@@ man of the reform@@ ist movement &quot; We are church , &quot; explained by the former Reg@@ ens@@ burger Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 year old brother of the emer@@ itus of Benedict XVI .
it would be willing to serve the Catholic Church , when Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would choose to express its deep@@ enings on their own sub@@ missions or at the time false assessment of the processes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Vatican Council &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Os@@ servat@@ ore Rom@@ ano , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , critic@@ ised that during the reporting of violence with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; measurement &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
regarding the attacks in Regensburg , no one knows that it would have been prevented and damaged in the future ; however , the &quot; degree of medi@@ al man@@ ipulation , &quot; so the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , hist@@ ori@@ ans and member of the national Italian Austrian Bio@@ eth@@ ics Committee .
&quot; the acc@@ ust@@ omed to mark the Catholic Church as a source of all evil experience , is already part of the everyday experience and prepar@@ es the public opinion that is to be normal for normal , writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia .
Fürst@@ in Gloria of Th@@ urn and tax@@ is said in the interview with Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk : &quot; one likes to go on the church and this is a second catch . &quot;
in addition , they pointed out that in their youth &quot; sl@@ ings have been a very normal educational means &quot; to be done with fre@@ est@@ ing children , as I was one was ready to be finished . &quot;
they are un@@ fair , present the standards for earlier decades , because the world has changed .
in connection with reports about the abuse of mis@@ sil@@ es , Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also appeared .
&quot; &quot; &quot; totally wrong , the author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who talked with R@@ atz@@ inger the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the protection , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says E@@ emann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for all that had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly is the 440 @-@ page report , which the dioc@@ ese was presented by the dioc@@ ese Regensburg with the En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment of Law Ulrich Weber ?
a total of 5@@ 47 Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were killed between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s &quot; with high pl@@ au@@ si@@ bility &quot; victims of over@@ took , 67 domain names were sexually ab@@ used .
in the final report it is called Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; the summary , that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. was applied in many cases of physical and psychological violence .
in case of high ow@@ at@@ onal@@ ity the punishment for students could also be violent .
in contrast to numerous others , many victims were estimated that many victims were estim@@ ating the general humanity of R. rated and therefore even more positive memories with him in numerous cases . &quot;
in the interview , E@@ emann , why the final report of the Miss@@ y Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger of his opinion was declared .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inci@@ dents of Viol@@ ence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a contra@@ dic@@ tory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a lift many students out his &quot; Human@@ ity . &quot;
on the other hand , he will also appear as a Chol@@ eri@@ ker and Perf@@ ection , the Ö@@ f@@ teren hand@@ ful , when a domain is musi@@ cally produced no top performance .
how do you evaluate when his biograph@@ er report this final report ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you read the effort and read all the 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask ourselves , why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger must first come in it .
it is just eight pages devoted to him and it is clearly acquitted of any sus@@ pic@@ ion of the medi@@ al or knowledge of sexual abuse of sexual abuse .
the non@@ violence at the pre@@ school occurred outside of his active sphere .
you can count him from late , of which too late or first an@@ gu@@ ises have not been taken enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; salvation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; heaven &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; better world &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , the vast majority of his pupils Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is a very excellent record , describes him as &quot; warm &quot; , &quot; competent , &quot; competent , &quot; competent , &quot; competent , &quot; competent , &quot; competent , &quot; competent , &quot; competent and bon@@ b@@ ons &quot; from the grapes of children . &quot;
merely a minority is worth over its perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high ow@@ at@@ onal@@ ity that led to w@@ ut@@ ili@@ ze once again .
so that he did not just threw the keys and the keys , but also ear@@ nest on the ground , but also ear@@ nest care of hair or ears , he has already been settled even before years ago , and was sorry for itself .
however , in his honor , however , such correc@@ tive methods in frag@@ ment@@ ing time , the 1960s and 1970s , were widely distributed , with parents such as teachers .
do you also know such breeding methods ?
of course , I think each of us who was born before 1968 .
I also have experienced that in a world @-@ world@@ ly school , a state Gymnasium , experienced .
compared to what actually , in this report , namely , sexual abuse and non@@ violence at the pre@@ school , are the fre@@ il@@ i Bag@@ at@@ ellen .
there one can already ask if it was not more likely to do with his acquain@@ t@@ ness and his role as brother of Benedict XVI , that many media just fell upon him .
on the Bavarian Pope , many who have never understood it , still more ei@@ ving .
but the truth is : the report von Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
in connection with the report a lot about abuse during Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen has been reported in connection with the report .
becomes Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the final report also any processing or knowledge in relation to sexual abuse of load ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : very clearly no .
no one of the 67 victims of sexual survi@@ vor@@ s claims to have entrusted to the domain name .
not even the parents were consecrated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never thought to speak with my father or my mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a person representative for the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was really very embar@@ r@@ assing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real problem in the En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment of sexual abuse was and is that most victims origin@@ ate from Sch@@ am .
if they trusted not even by parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then not a ch@@ orus of ch@@ orus , who had been a colleague of the perpet@@ rators .
how do you evaluate the Domain student R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of mis@@ sil@@ es ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a questi@@ oned students form@@ ulate it so : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case , in which he had expected to be missed ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) .
I think it ... also for truly ab@@ sur@@ d , to accept that ... Bu@@ ying ur@@ gent or clear@@ er , or rather opened , as opposed to their parents , inter@@ nat@@ s@@ leit@@ ers , confi@@ denti@@ ality , etc .
that one speaks with him over sex ... - un@@ th@@ ink@@ able . &quot;
thus the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; that in advance to affected pupils and / or their environment , could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation . &quot;
so , what sexual abuse is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is free from everyone .
so you can &apos;t be accused him not prevented him or to display it .
therefore , no reason to bring his good name with these contra@@ cted crimes in connection , as it happened in some cases .
in the media there was a lot of &quot; non@@ violence &quot; to read &quot; Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
the former domain name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused in the report &quot; Weg@@ ener . &quot;
must he live with this approach ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the great problem that , in the reporting period , was mixed with a huge mel@@ ange from sexual abuse and non@@ violence and somewhere in the middle of the Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but that &apos;s exactly this is a mis@@ use of the report .
there is clean separately , between the school and the Gymnasium of the Cathedral @-@ atzen , between sexual abuse and non@@ violence as well as we say once , other occurr@@ ences .
furthermore , the report dates from the time since 1945 , thus also from four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not ch@@ oral director of the Cathedral .
the whole aw@@ ful test ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases , in which boys of seasonal teachers have been controlled and mal@@ ign@@ ited , were all involved in the school in Et@@ ter@@ zh@@ ausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sk@@ and@@ al@@ ous states have to have reigned .
but with whom , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , for he got the boys only to face when they had already been on the domain name .
on that , as most of the witnesses of witnesses , the theme &quot; Pre @-@ school &quot; tab@@ oo . &quot;
one was only happy , you escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; par@@ a@@ it@@ alian &quot; states .
what was different from the domain store ?
Michael E@@ emann : since there was a discipline , but no seasonal violence .
and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report comes to the conclusion that &quot; many victims of the general humanity of R. estim@@ ates and therefore , in many cases , even positive remin@@ ders with him . &quot;
so it remains the way to have gone away .
but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods , in which it was reported in the state of the school .
the first time 1970 / 71 , when he had just began to establish and from the predecess@@ ors at a school where he had not worked , and was not responsible ( so the witness ) wanted to hear , and then again at 1993 .
swal@@ lowed Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently the ears ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , since 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asium .
in this case , he indicates that in the pre@@ school will continue to be pract@@ ising the test penalty . &quot;
due to the risk of negative pres@@ ets , he ur@@ gent in@@ wards .
that was of course at a time when legal clarity was previously banned in Bavaria since then .
before that they had occurred in a legal gray zone , like every one of us know .
it was also difficult for him to estimate , where the affected people may ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated or dramatically , where actually the permissible limit was exceeded .
but one can &apos;t say that he would have gone away .
that is simply not right .
the test was officially abolished in Bavaria in 1980 .
Fürst@@ in Gloria of Th@@ urn and Taxis claimed that it is un@@ fair , today to apply today &apos;s ped@@ agog@@ ical standards .
how do you see that ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : we are talking about the &quot; Fall@@ u@@ ck of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; so the danger to evaluate past today &apos;s moral standards .
since the prin@@ cess has already been right .
but this does not apply to sexual abuse , who was ab@@ stain@@ ed at all times and not for what was broken in contra@@ di@@ ments and violence to innocent children &apos;s nurs@@ ery , which dates back far beyond that time .
this is all very horri@@ ble and I &apos;m glad that it is finally finished .
but at the same time I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , because all that had nothing to do with him .
his means to discipline and punishment , thus ear@@ ne@@ on and to pull the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .
as a physical punishment then he was forbidden , he has also kept it .
what picture of his Reg@@ ens@@ burger time has Georg R@@ atz@@ inger for the talks with you for the book &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; ?
came the subject of testing for language ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedict XVI , told from his perspective , since the domain names played a side roll .
nevertheless , I didn &apos;t know that he led there a stric@@ ter Reg@@ iment there .
but this also must be said : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without the demand for un@@ conditional discipline , it would be hardly possible to form national cultural ambassador for Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with K@@ ek@@ sen and Bon@@ b@@ ons alone , one finds no great singers and before each success , equal to which area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ over@@ coming .
what people do you have experienced by Georg R@@ atz@@ inger at the talks about her book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond , I really know George R@@ atz@@ inger really well known and again experienced a wonderful , hum@@ orous , basic and warm good people , from which you can &apos;t imagine that he could do something like a fly something .
I &apos;m getting regularly with how many former domain names still today , 23 years after his Emer@@ ging , regularly contact with him , visit him - he is almost blind and him as a member of their family .
those who did not forgive him until today , that he was once strictly too much to them , so are definitely in the minority .
most Dom@@ sp@@ ans are grat@@ eful to him today that he enrich@@ ed her life and brought them the world of music .
and that it is always a good , v@@ ehem@@ ently teacher - a str@@ enger father , forget that it might be - but also a pleasant resp@@ ect@@ ful resp@@ ect@@ son , who still looked at today and honour them .
and please , at once again clearly : everything you have th@@ rows , are educ@@ ated methods that were on the agenda at that time .
we can be glad that we have long been overcome this time .
but it &apos;s highly un@@ just , a man , only because he is promin@@ ently and one more prominent brother has to make for the medi@@ al fall of sin .
there is the evil intention that stands behind it , but it is obvious .
for the report , which was just published , dischar@@ ged him .
now the rising areas , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who had acquired great services , and without the outside Bay@@ erns and perhaps nobody wanted to know the ra@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen station , finally in peace .
