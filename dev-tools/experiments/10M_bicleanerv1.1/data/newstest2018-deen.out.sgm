<seg id="2">A wander Anstalt, where young people should meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A tomb chapel, where there is now excavated for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Economists emitting the former ground of peasants.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official card coin encourages exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It nerves if land cards are not current.</seg>
<seg id="7">This knows everyone who had already had to excitement, because the car-Navi showed a green meadow instead of a change road.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bayern-Atlases, an offer of geoportisation as Bavaria of the State Government, are all other than currently - yet is therefore very revealing.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when you compare it with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it is evident that cities and municipalities in the area of the Munich Merkur have changed since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern Atlas is a flickry, which is not equal to such as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the great overview map for towns and communities, detailed maps, so-called primary data sheets were incorporated.</seg>
<seg id="13">This originated in accordance with the Bavarian surveying Administration between 1810 and 1864, and skip the first survey of Bayerns.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your principal: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second coalition war with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted a survey of the occupied country and gave a topographic survey of Bayerns in order - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Finally, when the French troops entered the peace of Lunéville of 9 February 1801, they were the present neighbors who created the idea of a surface of Bavaria map.</seg>
<seg id="18">Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph drove the project further, and founded the "Topographic Bureau" - making the Bavarian surveying management.</seg>
<seg id="19">The programme for Munich comes from the year 1856 and is like to find all the others on the Bavarian State Library.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of early / Today is the example of the state capital at the most impressive.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded into all directions and has grown.</seg>
<seg id="22">One example is subsendling that is still relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was born 21 years after the production of the map, i.e. 1877, in Munich district.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today Untersendling is located right in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses are concentrated along the present Plinganserstraße in 1856, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today the Westpark is, you can see nothing as a fields - at first sight: a smaller card with dozens of lines and numbers: handwritten entries from the so-called "Urals" which was derived from the basic tax.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "small plots there are no farmers there today - but small gardeners of the plant" "" "Land in Sun" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is characterized by the north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, since 1810, was a meadow of the Oktoberfest since 1810, was still a meadow, and no concrete bust.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar, the historic map shows an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the prehistoric site Au-Haidhausen in the area of today's district Au-Haidhausen not only the street name "on the fan" - but also in large letters "wander Anstalt."</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfeldwestraße, man encountered people with madness.</seg>
<seg id="33">There was in 1858 / 59 the Munich Circle-Irrenanstalt "On the Auer fan."</seg>
<seg id="34">In 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden managed the institution - the psychiatrist who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "he was advanced for his time and finished for example the crankings of the so-known." ""</seg>
<seg id="36">In addition, he has also taught the staff to apply violence against the occupants, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Museum of Haidhausen, who has joined an exhibition with the Anstalt.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients first place was first place, and later was expanded to 500 places.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sometime, this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrenanstalt in hair 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">Since 2006 Isar-AMPER-Klinikum München-Ost is one of Germany's largest psychiatrist of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="40">At the area of the former Auer Anstalt, young people meet in Munich Salesianum.</seg>
<seg id="41">The order acquired the building complex in 1920, and walked in a youth house with training.</seg>
<seg id="42">West is the football field of TSV Munich East, east of residential houses from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">In 2015, the children-house "Casa Don Bosco" - built in architectural rejection to the origin of the Irrenanstalt who had been destroyed during World War II.</seg>
<seg id="44">The Marienplatz was ranked as "main square" in 1856, the Kaufingerstraße was called "Kaufinger Gasse."</seg>
<seg id="45">A decisive change brought the Second World War in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The bombs of the Allies broke many holes in the city in December 1944.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big stayed until today - on Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business houses and a tomb chapel from the Middle Ages were once again at Marienhof, where this day will work on and on April 5, 2017, for the second S-Bahn route.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider, the old Munich map is to compare with the aerial photograph of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Citizen of rights published for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the Promotion of coloured glass has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Missouri due to the discrimination policy and the racist attacks of the state to Missouri.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory Board for the State of Missouri, which is to enter into force on August 28, 2017, calls for afro-American travellers, visitors and Missourians, as a series of fragmented incidents in the entire state, and here noted," says it in the opinion of the Group.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recent law of Missouri, which makes people heavier, discrimination and discrimination of state, which undisproportionate on minorities, pleases the group that travel to travel, said the NAACP.</seg>
<seg id="54">"you have injuries of the civil rights to happen people.</seg>
<seg id="55">They will stick together because of their skin colour, they will be beaten or killed, "said the President of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet."</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning, which has issued the organization for a state in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group cited incidents like racist insurrection against black students at the University of Missouri and death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">At the beginning of the year, Sanders died in the beginning of the year after he had no petrol during the journey through the state of Missouri and was charged with the police of Missouri.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also shows a recent report by the Office of the Secretary-General of Missouri in which black drivers will be more common than white by the state in the state 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware of people and their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," said Chapel.</seg>

<seg id="64">The traveller is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to accuse a company for home or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil-Liberties Union (ACLU) had published travel distances for Texas and Arizona, issued by the States immigration authorities to plead people because of immigration violations, which will contribute to the view of ACLU to further profiling.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel distances are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but in recent times, stakeholder groups have been involved in response to certain laws and trends within the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">Weird project is Elemental</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fischerbacher Weidezvn project is a success project and is continued in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU German Bundestag (German) Peter White and Kordula Kovac have a painting in front of the village.</seg>
<seg id="70">At the Rechtexcavation of the family Schwendemann met representatives of the CDU of CDU-City Associations together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MEPs.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann granted first insights into his operation, in which he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest farmed, 40 dairy cows and also lots of young animals.</seg>
<seg id="72">"" "the" Black Forest "" "" is the alternative market for the milk of his cows, swingman. "" "</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the Feriengths there is exclusively regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">Since he is also called BLHV-President of Fischerbach, he called the electric fence as "Elemental".</seg>
<seg id="75">I can not produce steep surfaces on derart steep surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="76">The green area care for a lot of work, a lot to be processed with the engine sense.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "we have here to fight with the terms and with the topography" "" "stressed Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003, he took over the eldest operation and joined this without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if it lead no biooperation.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear:" "" "the commune has recognized the meaning of the electric fence and is happy about the leader promotion." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">With cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, the farmers should be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">You hope that the surface of the surfaces could be pulled out for a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the biggest treasure we have, are the people who work in agriculture and are thinking about how they continue their operation," "" "he stressed the mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">The farmers are often involved in criticism</seg>
<seg id="84">A total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">The discovering surface amounts to 40 hectares that are not permitted until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Of the total cost of 71 500 euros, half of the leader was funded, a quarter contributed by the community of Fischerbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus, the farmers had to invest 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16,2 kilometers.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," declared Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="89">Kordula Kovac stressed: "you do not make a good job, without farmers and pastures it doesn't go."</seg>
<seg id="90">Also for Peter White: "the best food is produced here."</seg>
<seg id="91">The rural districts (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables the state subsidies of women's tough.</seg>
<seg id="92">The objective is the disclosure of the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">A prerequisite is the presence of one of the LPR-drawn conveyor system.</seg>
<seg id="94">In addition, the fenced area must not be bad (Hanging tilt above 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened with the collection.</seg>
<seg id="95">For the 2018 Fischerbacher Weifence project 2018, the application of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build 16 kilometres fence.</seg>
<seg id="96">The disclosure area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes up the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans estimate the same as any other as any other - so the overthrow of Saddam Hussein was staged at the Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, knew what he did when he did a symbolic Axt in a heated battle with Jim Acosta of CNN over the proposals of the drastic reduction of the legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To stay fair, Miller handle not the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of Boys and Liberty Imitators met him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he took hold of their significance, and especially the significance that you were attributed to Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after completion of the monument, its base was added.</seg>
<seg id="105">When Miller Acosta writes: "I don't want to enter a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that lightens the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem, which you refer to which later added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is true properly, but how he formulated it, doesn't really go about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It's about contemporary resonance at Lazarus, the only one who invites not only any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your rubbish, your poor, and your oppressed crowds, which are ready to breathe out, and the needy out of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time to see in the "elongating waste" on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller had not been engaged in literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural meditation: it is indeed a conflict with the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who have committed themselves to place their words and their death on the basis - did very good that they had a high political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and american republicism, in an unused classical photo depiction the female embodiment of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem is the female figure no more abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And they himself gives itself another name: mother of Exilions.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the picture is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on the US Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus changed the significance of the statue, people wanted to change the people from the right wing.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great write as Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was discharged, but rather a early neo-conservative, the American flame goes into the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty continues.</seg>
<seg id="119">It should carry the torch of the freedom from the United States in the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch should not shine the way into the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual is Limbaugh here on something exposed.</seg>
<seg id="122">The importance of the statue is quite and a question of the standing perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative act of Lazarus existed in them to see how they were seen from exhausted, but hopeful people after long and often horrible travel on the decks of ships was seen.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the true sense of this, the world from a perspective of people who seek refuge and improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue says to them the words of hope and of the welcome you have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And this is not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever wanted to know.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch shall not shine the way, but the hatred, which is the only source of power, ignites.</seg>
<seg id="128">World Cup 2017: Neil Black is Scottish members of the United Kingdom</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle remembered a time when two shallots belonged to the UK team.</seg>
<seg id="130">The performance director of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-strong Scottish contingent of the World Championship will afford a massive contribution to the team. "</seg>
<seg id="131">A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London in 2017, starting on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="132">Black believes that "in Scotland has developed something special" and the athletics of the United Kingdom has to learn anything from it.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "" "" "we welcome it, and we try to understand it, and we will take it, until we'll need to figure out" "" "said Black." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">"I say with people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think that it has something to do with what they did.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they did.</seg>
<seg id="136">British Athletics: it has something to do with what they did.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type on the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medallilen candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m circuit, while Eilidh Doyle was chosen from the team to the team.</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eilidh is quite modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">Their capitals was incredible, "says Black.</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or, wherever they live or exercise, went out of room and felt very motivated and were very motivated.</seg>
<seg id="143">The passion and the real feeling, the Eilidh, of course, were great. "</seg>
<seg id="144">The Commonwealth Silver medallists who will compete in its fifth world championships at the 400-m hurdles, says that it is "unbelievably" that 16 Clots are in the British team.</seg>
<seg id="145">The best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were achieved in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The "" "" "" "the" "" "Muir" "" "reaches five British and two European records in the past year." ""</seg>
<seg id="147">It will participate in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs.</seg>
<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare, the 1,500 m running, is another Scotsman, who is looking for a great season, showing the victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembered her first world championships, when the only other Scotsman was in the team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">The Mannheim capitultural change says that they are "enormously" to the fact that many of its countrymen are not only belong to the team, but in some cases also with the medals and the final.</seg>
<seg id="151">"" "" "" "so that they voted to be the team in fact that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so that we have voted great honour for me, but to know that my team mates have voted for me and voted me something very special for me," "" "she added." ""</seg>
<seg id="152">"" "" "" "obviously I'm very proud of all the shallots that belong to the team." ""</seg>
<seg id="153">It shows just how far we came.</seg>
<seg id="154">And they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to climb on pores.</seg>
<seg id="155">What my speech is concerned in capitals?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think it went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home World Championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to use this home support and to benefit from that we are back at the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">I get a second chance to go and compete, and it's just a great atmosphere at the outside. "</seg>
<seg id="160">Block from critics on Facebook: do not get you a public position when you do not manage to prevent electors.</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the newspapers beat him because of the inner policy until his political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He shook at the critique, safe.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he didn't put his critics to silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "because in 1783 Washington said:" "" "the speechism can be taken away - and, silly and dumb, we are led like the sheep to the battles." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who needs to work more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union defendants him in the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The staff of the Governors dismissed the lawsuit as frivolutions, and the online comment was full of a counter-action with "Na, and?"</seg>
<seg id="170">"" "" "" "it's only Facebook" "", "said many people." ""</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important if it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a fixed hand at the leadership of his state and strict compliance with principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect to his electors and to deplating his hairless head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore, the blocking of persons who come to the side of the governors - which is a public forum, which is officially designated and of employees that are paid by public tax-Dollars - unnecessary and finally dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post defended Hogans spokesperson Amelia Chasse defended the actions of the governors and argued that the blocking of comments is nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the picture of wheels or chambers or water filled people using the whip converter.</seg>
<seg id="181">The Post spoke with some of the people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And that are only real people who speak with their chosen leaders: a teacher, a businessman and a priest, no trolls.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said that their comments respectful, thinking and not profited.</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appeals to Hogan Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Lawyer in Lakshmi's Sarma Ramani von Bowie, Md., was not hassy, but she asked them to hate Hasselt.</seg>
<seg id="186">"" "" "" "I commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction in Hasselt and other current news," "" "she wrote in the language range of the news" "" "The Post" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="187">"" "" "" "I don't think this idea, if a number of people in the same topic takes place, then they are considered as so-called collective use and not recognized as a major group of people affected." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="188">What the employees of the governor as "concentrated spam-attack," would other likely be "intercession."</seg>
<seg id="189">The facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply deleted a critic or negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in previous time, when you have done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn with critical ladders and to burn or discord to silence.</seg>
<seg id="191">But just that happens in digital.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public officials, which criticises that he has implicit on Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is proclaim from Twitter users, blocked by his Twitter Feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question fell last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">The chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County passed the First Ajiment, according to the U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she named a voters from their Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Before (R) also received a visit from ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so hard.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the moment of Washington, the time of affordable Portos had a similar effect as the internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers multiply between 1776 and 1800, and an anonymous letter stroke on his lead.</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then Washington had anonymous Trolle.</seg>
<seg id="201">The people, pseudonyms like "Juricola," Valerius, "Belisarius," and "Portius" wrote to all letters to newspapers that made war decisions.</seg>
<seg id="202">Petitions that have been awarded its Standpoint on the Treaty of Amity, Trade and shipping with Great Britain criticised his position, according to the historical documents, which were collected by the online Papers of George Washington Project.</seg>

<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If yes, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Political ico reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to restrict the information flow to President Trump - including reports of the news media - in hope to keep the boss on a constant exchange rate.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, joined his first working day with senior staff, he exhibited a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House which he repented: bad information that come into the hands of the President.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told the staff that information should flow through him - whether on paper or in mailings - because the President would make better decisions if he would get good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Waist diagnosis makes sense, but others tried to count Trump, monitor his media reports.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumps's relationship to television last decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"" "" "" "if Trump was delayed due to a unfair coverage, it was productive to show him that he received a fair coverage of places that were to convince," "" "said the former election consultant Sam Nunberg in February compared to political." ""</seg>
<seg id="1399">Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote to the time that "the key, Trumps Twitter custom amongst control, according to six former election campaign officials, insists that his personal media consumption has a permanent praise."</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps Twitter custom ever "was under control," is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps this campaign is something that we don't know other things - that Trumps Tweets without their interventions have been included.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will never hear something about the tweets that the trump has not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his employees were able to keep his collaborators, trouble shooting from him, then their efforts have worth it.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But nobody can consistently prevent Trump controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">A part of the problem is that people in a white house, which are composed of competing parties, always try to present their own agenda by promoting trump material that may promote their views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Political - all with this history - reported in May about the preference of consultants, to provide the president of strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"" "" "" "current and former Trump-officials say that Trump can react to negative press cuts, especially those with damaged Lecks, and that he could find out on it from whence they come." ""</seg>
<seg id="1410">This happened at the end of February when somebody gave a copy of a copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet Provokateurs Charles C. Johnson, who gave the Deputy Chief of Staff to Katie Walsh, "the source behind a cluster will be at the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson was banned from Twitter because he has offered no specific evidence, or that he expressed false allegations made in the past and contradict them.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and began to ask employees about Walsh. "</seg>
<seg id="1413">Goldmacher added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary-General of the White House, Rob Porter, "tried to implement a system to manage and document the trump."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did it work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries to do it three months later, the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove as Priebus as Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his adviser still influence influence.</seg>

<seg id="1482">The paper evaluates the step as a sign that Mueller has widened its investigations and intensified.</seg>

<seg id="1488">The Washington Post "wrote some weeks ago that the special mediator of Trump was personally arranged into the centre and search the allegation, whether the President might possibly handicapped the judiciary.</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand jurys is to prove that evidence is to test and decide whether the indictment should be charged.</seg>

<seg id="1532">A complete shot spring is broken there, AWI-researcher Daniela Jansen writes.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There is some evidence that the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is in danger because the front edge has never pulled back as far as at present.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the ice plate at voltage and can be crushed, if at a key point there is a piece of pick-up.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melt of Schelfeis and Eisberg increases the sea level as they swim on the water and mix as much water as it yields after the melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the scrapers leads to the sea that glacier can flow directly into the sea and much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase the level of sea level, however, only in the low degree, the British research project writes the observation of Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is according to AWI-information with almost 50 000 square kilometres, the fourth biggest shanfeis of Antarctica.</seg>
<seg id="1539">At the crossing from the mainland, it is up to 700 metres thick, on the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters.</seg>

<seg id="1796">He became a symbol of Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The Lavender is due to the conditions in drought and due to the incriminating insects and due to the diseases of the insects, which are trying to find solutions, great headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, expert of the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "the Lavender in Provence is effective because the plant was exposed to climate change in spring much less rain and in the autumn much more.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has impact on the lifespan of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">There is also a small Zikade, a micro-bacteria, the dwarf-cades transfers, and with very dry weather there are many of them. "</seg>

<seg id="1803">Eric Chaisse said: "instead of very long vegetable oils with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, UNTERENTWICKELTE and either missing or weakened.</seg>
<seg id="1804">So we have less parts with essential oil. "</seg>

<seg id="1810">The employee of the weekly Riodoce is usually on Wednesdays to review their plans for the recent chaos within the state of Sinaloa through which organized crime, corrupt civil servants and unaudible drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But this day, in the shadow of her own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">It was told them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-level journalists discuss what safer feel: you should take their children to the office, who were the aim of a attack with granite or at home in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Safety experts have submitted three words to a table on the front of the room: adversaries, Neutrale, Allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask reporter, names for any column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and abdominal feel.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drugs dirty, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected to stand on the vote list of the government or the cartels, a catalog of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There are no rest of violence, and during all the country the bodies are frequent, there are more journalists at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012. 589 are after attacks and threats under federal law and until now there were at least seven dead in seven countries.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter, their editors and their Inspirator of Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist," "" "wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books about violence in connection with drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His lack is felt deep, although his presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, which shows his middle finger with the word "Justice," hangs on the facade of the Riodoce-building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, carry T-shirts, which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop will take place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared topics, trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although in 2010, a special Prosecution was established to process the cases of journalists, according to the Committee for the Protection of journalists only two penalties.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most thousands of murder, which are associated with drugs and organisational crimes, the murderers of journalists are only rare in court.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodoce, they still have to treat the violence of Sinaloa, although they are intrample, and even though the Terrain is still more tolerable.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the murderer, without righteousness, the meeting for the discussion of safety, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"" "" "" "it is very stupid, turning my time in this workshop" "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we know not the why we don't know everything."</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the state capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He only managed to drive a couple of blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was forced by two men. it was shot out of his car and was shot on it for 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper - that is translated with "12th river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The cap went away in his car and damaged it in the vicinity.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But there's practically nothing about silence in the theme of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzmans was arrested in the past year and the extradition in the United States in January, Sinaloa became one of the bloody battlefields of the country, as riveting fractions are fighting here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It does nothing that anyone can be shot in Sinaloa every day or more people on the road or that the cemetery is full of enched, two-story mouse olques for drugs, which are larger than many houses for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">"" "" "" "forget for a minute that there is a state of" "" "rest," "" "if only one map is the control of the coastal road with its valuable ports and drugs trade routes in the United States." ""</seg>
<seg id="1838">Yet despite the fact that Valdez was aware that Valdez was aware of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), co-founder and director of Riodoce, with the guilt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstanding have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First published in February the publication of an interview with Damasco Lopez, a leader of a rivalled cartel fractions in the war with Guzmans sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have been offended, the Gangmembers bought each copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper kiosk.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second fault was that Valdez was not to force to force, after the confiscation of another newspaper, which had published the same story to leave the country on its own safety.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing will be regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had so long survived, that his friends and colleagues annahms that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he sold five colleagues to the founding of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "in Sinaloa," "" "it was impossible to operate journalism without turning to the noise" "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1847">With the time the newspaper had been a reputation because of the courageous and honourable coverage, and sales and advertising took part.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters love to publish hard drive investigations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by the publication that nobody could read anything else.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the foundation of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors Cabot Prize" for their coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the Protection of journalists for his courage to persecutions on the Mexican's history, wherever they lead them.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave himself up to that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I would like to live," he said at the time of the CPJ Award.</seg>
<seg id="1853">Drug traffin Sinaloa is a way of life, "he said in an interview with Rompeviento-TV in October last October.</seg>
<seg id="1854">"you must take the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb.</seg>
<seg id="1855">"" "I would not want to be asked:" "" "what did you do in view of many dead... why did you not tell what went before?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Riodoce team vanished Valdez, the fun bird that was like a harbour worker, the friend who was generous with embrace and advice was a teacher who knew how one survived.</seg>

<seg id="1858">He would always bear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always be to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and there always sit on the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">Well, they ask: was his love for the routine his destruction?</seg>

<seg id="1871">Without, two policemen sought protection against the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a mid-class quarter of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the shear, some of the reporters asked whether those officers belong to the 50 per cent of the policemen who also called the governor himself as a trustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months ago, since the reporter have gone into the mountain landscape where the drug bound de facto are under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week, Riodoce has roasted on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former famous Boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé to the state spending, concentrated on the hometown of the governor.</seg>

<seg id="1892">During a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to gather journalists and destroy them, because they said the truth.</seg>

<seg id="2020">On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken by its core.</seg>

<seg id="2024">Confusing, since nobody had posted information on their feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah has been constantly prayed for their timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The Rapper from the territory of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, who was killed by a white policemen in Ferguson, Mo., was killed, live.</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted a picture of Browns leblosem body, which was stretched out on the road and remain there for four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"that's wild," I thought at Ferrell.</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was for them and their fellowship nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She put her mobile phone to returning later on the evening of Tweets on the Canfield Drive.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There were photos of the police band and people who had cried out, and from a man who claimed to be a sign with the inscription: "Fergusons Police has just killed my innocent son!"</seg>
<seg id="2032">They observed a live feed where a policeman stands in front of a group of demonstrators with a bellished dog.</seg>

<seg id="2038">They booked a return flight and went home to the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After landing at 23 o'clock, she took her 6-year-old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two next morning would go to Ferguson.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened in the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, the theme of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?," in the cinemas from the 11.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a history of the survivors and the protest, the strength and the power, the strength and the resistance, which consists of the perspective of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to ask answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">When Ferrell carried her daughter, a flower dress, and a matching crown, after Ferguson, the two of them had a conversation, which they had numerous occasions in front of this morning "on the black experience and the black condition."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"" "" "" "you remember, as I have taught you when black people have to fight for they?" "" "she reminded of what she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2044">"we now go to Ferguson, because the police killed an 18 year old boy, and that was not true.</seg>
<seg id="2045">I could not take it, "said Ferrell later.</seg>
<seg id="2046">"what happens today is a highlight of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">She must know and see it and be removed in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">It must be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also know the various layers of the black experience and the black Constitution and what we must do to free to free ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Even if I have the luck to give her an experience in which she does not have any ecclonal racism, it is not different than the next black women child.</seg>
<seg id="2050">I have the feeling I would have a bad service to keep it far. "</seg>
<seg id="2051">The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the Police Department, which was waiting for a camp as the activists in the potential non-indictment from Officer Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There is Ferrell and her daughter linked to a local business owner who made lunch.</seg>

<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It's all come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan evening, one of the co-directors of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2059">Folayan said, she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted only "document" what happened.</seg>
<seg id="2060">A question came by Ferrell in the meaning: "would you document or try to find a story that you can use?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">This skepticism was nurtured by countless cases of people, often of white - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2062">As folayan recently declared in an interview: "we had heard that people who were born in Ferguson and grew up, their voices were not centred, and we wanted to do it."</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan had already worked together with the co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area that is known for its activism around the death of death.</seg>
<seg id="2064">His commitment brought by Ferrell the project together with six other natives the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after Browns shooting.</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talking with us. we speak," said Davis.</seg>
<seg id="2066">"" "" "" "this was the main thing for me as these people are displayed, because I will be represented." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2067">The goal was to focus on Ferrells experience - to show that it is not a Messiah leader, but for a community that comes together, "said Folayan - she proved to be the obvious number of participants in the film.</seg>
<seg id="2068">What are the documents of "Whose Streets?" surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrells lives as she loves and marries their wife.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," she said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2070">"" "" "" "but I understood that there must be certain vulnerability during this work and the human of the black people." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2071">In addition, Ferrells history repeats the role of black pregnant women in the wider Black-Lives movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founders of the movement that have influenced the film "BlacklivesMatter" in 2012, identifies the film "BlacklivesMatter" in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="2073">"" "" "" "black, pregnant women in managerial positions took the movement altogether," "" "said Ferrell," "" "and therefore we fight at different fronts." ""</seg>
<seg id="2074">Black, pregnant women have to bear the main load of everything. "</seg>
<seg id="2075">"" "Folayan voted" "" "note that" "" "the movement really is held by black women and many black women." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2076">However, it insisted that "this is not an innovative type of action," at the Ferrell has been selected as hearts of the film.</seg>

<seg id="2078">"" "" "" "it is no coincidence, although it was in front of the front, because with a life on those cloaks as a black, pregnant woman is as much on the game." ""</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel the energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">Meanwhile, the news-cameras in Ferguson have long disappeared, but the rainy connections between the community and the police continue to stand.</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on probation for 2 ½ years due to the blocking of a highway with a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">She describes the social atmosphere of the area that she calls their home: "a chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">However, she kled on a vocals and she feels the memory of this memorial since she went three years ago in Ferguson.</seg>

<seg id="2089">The bit Gallery moves the human being, even though it is not yet built.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre at the south-end of the pedestrian zone has been obsolete since the first presentation in 2009, the population in Beaches and opponents.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The topic hardly leaves the theme.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The theme will also be discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg."</seg>
<seg id="2093">While the one to the bit Gallery say: "that would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "This would be real class" (Nicole Becker), comes from the other side: "needs no man" (Siggi Beds) or completely: "size wahn!" (Lars Scholz).</seg>
<seg id="2094">While the fears build that a gallery contains more customers in the city, they also benefit from the other business, fear the adversaries, that the pedestrian zone would be bluttered.</seg>
<seg id="2095">In addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the plot in which the peasant market hall is available, in the 13 directors are marketed their products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">The construction work will be completed by the end of the construction.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The Gallery Macher want to integrate a market hall in the new building - namely to the Beda square with possibility to sit without sitting outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Room: "we've been buying back almost weekly in the peasant market for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cake of the women are still very happy.</seg>

<seg id="2108">There are already enough in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">You can see how many shop transactions are empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">But there is not even a regular weekly market here, it is so important that at least it remains the market hall.</seg>
<seg id="2111">For all the goods offered there is fresh, mainly directly from the producer, and is offered at low cost.</seg>
<seg id="2112">As you can see, shop transactions in a shopping centre is rented only from larger firms, because the rental rentals are often not portable for one retailer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Too bad, special transactions, there are almost no more and what is still left, will probably disappear. "</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping mall with a market hall is not suitable for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Above all, where is the peasant market hall during the construction time?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old EDEKA would be the solution - even in duration when the bit Gallery comes in fact.</seg>

<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "that's just not work.</seg>

<seg id="2122">But for a peasant hall, it is also possible thanks to the madly many - as I find - senseless building projects in Bitburg no place anymore.</seg>

<seg id="2125">In the middle of the room of Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces are visible - white, black and brown which are almost invisible - which hang on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits have been created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tuplights and hairs, which were sent by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the excerpts from the prison Fort Leavenworth, where the former secret service analytics obtained a 35-year prison sentence after she made public diplomatic news about the site of Wiki.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition, which opened on 2 August, is called A Becoming Resemblance (A matching similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">It is the product of two years Correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, their disciplines in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a Transition and groundbreaking dissidy, whose condemnation was converted by Barack Obama, when he had only three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg created by the algorithmic analysis of DNA, which was created by Manning, and out of the 30 portraits of DNA - the many wise men can be interpreted and the toughest determinations of these interpretations - but also for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, which was born as Bradley Edward, but has been talking about the identification as a woman, was convicted in 2013 because of 20 charges, including six violets against the spy law, computer and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">By the prison its picture was suppressed, so much that it was only one photo - a grained, black-white selfie, in the maning is definitely sitting on a seat and a platin blonde is wearing - it was associated with them.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg arrived from the great success of their 2012-Project'Stranger Visions. "</seg>
<seg id="2134">In this, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette blunt and chewing gum by extracted the DNA from the waste, to produce a picture of it, like those people could look like.</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time that she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they led an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," stated Dewey-Hagborg at a press review of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she couldn't visit at that time and she couldn't be photographed, therefore they took contact with Chelsea and asked them whether they wanted a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and their incarded muse were taken to undispossed Bricks who ruled several letters over the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even known one of Shoili Kanungo illustrated comic "Suppliers Images," which would convert a future, in which the President Chelyrightly would be able to see the exhibition personally.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama actually had just a few days after the book was published, Manning release after seven gross years in a military prison was a welcome kind of happier meeting.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also now at the opening of the exhibition a little depth and Starkes, da Donald Trump leads an war against informant from the government camps and against Transgender forces to find new, tweetable paths to prevent the rigid sphere which he actually is to escape.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked after the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen in a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In one on the wall of the gallery, Manning called Manning with its superseful signature (that "i" in her family name is equipped with a heart) an end of the "automatic treats, whose foundation gender, race, sexuality and culture have been."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall, its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousands of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped, through the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotide according to the highly developed scientific encyclopedia of the artist), like astonishing, at least in biological terms, we all are.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"" "" "" "what people are hopefully use that our genome will not take care of, who we are and how open genetic data for a interpretation and how subjective them are" "" "said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video artwork from 2007, Spurious memories, will also be seen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, hence the 30 of these stories are.</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition that is kept in an own room is a side from the mentioned Comic-Novelle.</seg>

<seg id="2211">"you are now tools such as Strava and Fitbit for the persecution of their health, but where is the Fitbit for your business?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analyzer is used by companies to measure employee commitment.</seg>
<seg id="2212">Errett said that she has a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.</seg>
<seg id="2213">In addition to the Snap surveys and surveys from certain teams, it offers a heat map of the company that shows the majority of most complaints and what managers have low condition results - so you can reboot why.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture, you will not have to stay at the top of the workplace, which has been published in Skandals, since then a former employee describes a blog post which describes an environment of harassessments, with those who have spoken, penalised.</seg>
<seg id="2215">For start-ups like Glint, this wish for an overview of a lucrative business possibility.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The global governance, regulation and compliance checks could have more than $118.7 billion, according to the financial technical website Let's Talk Payments.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, start-up Convercent, the company helps prevent evil behavior and to detect, saw an increasing interest and activity beginning of this year in the middle of the Uber-Fall in Misskredit.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Convercent has almost 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.</seg>

<seg id="2221">It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline, with which employees can report bad behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2222">And if the main managing director is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"the Court of Public Opinion has captured the Regulators," says Patrick Quinlan, the founder and managing director of Convercent.</seg>
<seg id="2224">If a company is found that his staff is poorly treated or inethical, it can experience precious consequences by consumers-boycott, employee fluctuation and complaints, said Quinlan.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations, has Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures, and have a simple way to achieve their corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Previously, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he had to submit or send a telephone number or e-mail to the company's headquarters, a formal complaint and hope that he was seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often a duty and uncomfortable experience, James Vitrano, Ruby TUESDAYS General Counsel, who said there was no good opportunity to track the complaints of employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Well, since the Convercent Convercent puts problems, the previously mentioned by executives who were in offices in cities or countries, were hidden - such as discrimination, harassment or no more practitioners.</seg>
<seg id="2229">"I can be closer to this holistic, 360-degree view over the experience with employment," said Vitrano, who heads the risk management Group of Ruby Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"and we protect our shareholders from employment laws."</seg>

<seg id="2234">Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as service, and do the company with recurring fees for use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance to find the approval of Venture Capital investors, which supports both start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">Convercent received $10 million in financing in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, where the total capital was raised to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Glittering secured $10 million in November of Bessemer Venture Partners and brought the whole financing to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">These investment is hardly surprising, in view of a connected nature of businesses, culture and Venture Capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing complex in research that shows that the employees from their jobs more than before.</seg>
<seg id="2240">There are high salaries and interesting projects in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The employees want to have the feeling that you are accepted and appreciated that you will give your time a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"" "" "" "if people are glad to be happy to make their voices, and that the work that you are doing, then they will feel stronger, and they will feel stronger," "" "said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Spyee Experience in LinkedIn, which is both Convercent as well as Glint."

<seg id="2245">The data on employees work is important according to experts of the workplace culture.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data are useless if the administrator of a company does not take action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">In fact, if a company asks employees according to your feedback, it may have a anticipation that the change is on the way.</seg>

<seg id="2292">But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history of his cozy seat in the watl River Valley in Kent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophazi Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.</seg>

<seg id="2296">It is not the first book of Rhodes that was based on an archive: he wrote in 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection which was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project which he was unexpected.</seg>

<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for Responsible Robotics) (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus, professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we have to start their way up.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and type of fingernagel.</seg>

<seg id="2396">Modern Sexpuppen have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with deliberately human reaction that can be achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can also customize his robot according to its beliefs "and do everything to select from the eye color of the robot via the form of breast cancers to type or the color of his fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2398">But there will be still inquieter, as many robots have the "personalities," which would look like a stepford woman progressive.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern Sexpuppen have developed to robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The RealBotix robot allows for example its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they are appealing like relapses.</seg>

<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) have a vibrator, why can males then have no Roxxxy?" says it on the website.</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots not only need a fetish or just a different sexes.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their emergence and increasing refinement show a slightly darker and deepening in our culture, to retreat from the Ideal of Gender equality, to a wish of sex with subjugation as optional.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men, of course, no sex robots keep, and while FRR remembers their rising popularity, however, they remain a preliminary on the edge of the consumer culture.</seg>

<seg id="2424">Trumps great power?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney to the Instruction of the healthy human being</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a Binsencoisheit of the Trump era that the political divisions that have polarized the U.S. voters, even families in small format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and harvest, there were in the USA newspapers with advice about how to select the horror from trump.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We adore to us all supposedly in order to burst our filter bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noteemed is the power of Trumps, Families to accommodate families.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I chose this because my cousin, a left-directional dichterin who lives in Chicago and has long been involved with the Republican in our family, who visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">They reminded me that the unit may have a mighty effect against any common enemy.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House, everyone who knows it, including the republican transformation, with whom she had fought for decades because of politics suddenly and completely independent on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">In order to find the dining table it is certainly a good thing, but it falls in a further context that this also brings significant risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left hand was strengthened by Trump, but the greater impact of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">When we speak of "normalization" and Trump, we refer to the gruselige option that we will not encounter his kittens of a day anymore.</seg>
<seg id="2436">However, there is a terrifying long-time scenario, in the Trump Republicans of the right wing "normalizes" which appeared in comparison to his standards suddenly as an inepiteness of failure.</seg>
<seg id="2437">I found myself from an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's Comprehensive version of the betrayach, the 14% income tax (but at least, we knew how his tax declaration saw) - both in comparison to Trump in fact a very mild criminal offences.</seg>

<seg id="2442">Five-five years later, and I am not yet gone over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss Cottage - the themes Pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count, but a great roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">But the Central Park Carousel is still a strange magical experience since two two-year-old, an 11-year-old and two women in the 40-year-old, and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I had to evaluate the carousel, I would have given to him the full score, but fortunately no one asked after that.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, I was forced to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I was able to pass through my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In coffee at the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to purchase an average of 15% tip - this to buy something about the shop.</seg>

<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system such as a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could have the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The uncommon condition that affects approximately 1.3 million in the US and in Britain 300,000, causes magnets, recurring or blueprints, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>

<seg id="2584">The conductive researchers, Dr. Marco Colonna, declared that immune cells in Darm patrol, to ensure that harmful microbes that hide themselves in the food, did not enter into the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are able to resolve inflammation, are balanced of cells that protect the tolerance and protect the body without sensitive tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the balance is due to inflammation, it can result in an anti-inflammatory notation.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments was found that a type of tolerance transport immuncell in mice is required to bear a certain bacterium in their bowels.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the blocks of proteins - to resolve the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a connection between a bacteria art - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbial, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan the mice in their food, the more they had from these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and an intryptophan rich nutrition is tolerable, less inflammatory intestinal milieus, if the same system also uses people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The post-doctoral researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan was seeking a kind immune cell that had the tolerance found that a group of study mice had such cells, but a other group of the same tribe, but had not accommodated it.</seg>
<seg id="2593">They suspected that the difference with the intestinal microbians of mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, who usually live in the stomach's intestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The mice of mice were found DNA sequenzes and were found six bacterial species found in mice with immune cells, but without them were missing in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were detected in a sterile environment, so that a intestinal microbiome was missing and they were not developed this kind of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how bacteria results in the immune system, the researchers noticed L. reuteri in a liquid and then led small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells, which were isolated from the mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">Immunogens developed to tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">As the active component of the liquid was cleaned, it proved to be known as an additional product of tryptophan Metabolism, which is known as Indol-3-Milk acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers have doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of mice, the number of such cells were halved around 50 percent, but when the tryptophonist were halved, the number of cells fell by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan declared that people can protect the same tolerant cells such as mice, and that most of us will protect us in our gastro-intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether tryptophan annex products from L. reuteri have found the cells in humans such as in mice, but defects in genes were found on tryptophan in people with inflammatory loan.</seg>

<seg id="2866">The sensational approach has been heated up in the summer, because the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the existing brand, where Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United last season for 89 million pounds.</seg>
<seg id="2867">After the termination, Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the most affordable professional athlete in the world. PSG offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week.</seg>

<seg id="2869">But was the soccer world warned three years ago by the PSG President before this view?</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domspatzen Report disburdened by Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger"</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domestic Policy report on the abuses of the Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">The author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domestic atzen continues for discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian prophecy, spokesperson of reform movement "We are church," declared by the former Regensburger bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, as well as from the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emergenius Benedict XVI.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would be very serve to see the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger all of its own submissions or their then false assessment of the processes would press.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"" "in contrast, the Vatican City" "" "Osservatore Romano," "", "on the other, criticised that in the coverage of violence in the Domestic Policy with" "" "two-degree measure" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">Regarding the interventions in Regensburg, no one that it should be prevented for "confrontly and damaged deeds" that would be avoided, but the "degree of media manipulation," such as the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historians and member of the National Italian Bioethics Committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the attraction, the Catholic Church as a source of all evil experience, is already part of the everyday experience and prepare the public opinion that for normal," writes Scaraffia.</seg>
<seg id="2897">Also principally Gloria of Thurn and taxis thought in an interview with the Bayerischer Rundfunk: "you would like to go on the church and this is a folded thread."</seg>
<seg id="2898">Moreover, they pointed out that in their youth "hits a very normal educational agent," to be done with children, as I was one, finished. "</seg>
<seg id="2899">They are unfair to use today's standards for earlier decades, because the world have changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with reports about the misfortune cases, Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">In completely wrong, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who was translated with Ratzinger, "My brother of Pope" (translated into 12 languages).</seg>
<seg id="2902">"" "" "" "I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection," "" "says Hesemann," "" "for all this had nothing to do with him," "" "he considers the results of the final report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report presented by the diocese of Regensburg with the reconnaissance lawyer Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">A total of 547 Regensburger Domestic Policy were used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s "with great plausible" victims of overhandles, 67 Domestic sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report it is called Georg Ratzinger, who worked from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg: "summarizing, that by Domkapellmeister R. in many cases of physical and psychological violence have been applied.</seg>
<seg id="2906">The punishment for schoolchildren could even fall heavy for the pupils.</seg>
<seg id="2907">In contrast to numerous other things, many victims, estimated that many victims, estimated the general humanity of R. estimated and therefore, in numerous cases, despite violence even more positive memories were linked to him. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Hesemann, why the final report on the abuse of abuse during the Regensburger Domestic Policy Georg Ratzinger in his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr Hesemann, the 440-page report on the incidents of violence against the Regensburger Domestic Policy, "is a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">"" "for a lifting of many students his" "" "Humanity" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">For the other, it appears also as a Choleriker and perfectionist, which has been handy for the Öfteren when a domain rate is musically no top performance.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How can you be as his Biographer this final report?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you read the trouble and read all the 440 pages long report from the front to the rear, it is necessary to ask what is the name Georg Ratzinger at all in it.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Just 8 pages dedicated to him and it is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of mediation or co-knowledge in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The violence of violence at the preschool was also taking place outside its efficiency.</seg>
<seg id="2916">One can cause him to know hereafter, too late or first clarification was not seriously taken enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"" "the" "" "sky" "", "heaven" "" "and" "" "the sky" "" "was taken from practically all respondents than - so literal -" "" "heaven" "" "and" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">So the wide majority of his students Georg Ratzinger describes a very excellent witness, as "warm", "really good," expert "and" intelligible Teacher, who supplies the guys regularly with cake, cookies and Bonbons and "always from grapes of children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority is concerned about his perfectionism and its high quality motifs, which led to Wutabovchen already.</seg>
<seg id="2920">That he did not only cast along with chairs and cast the key and on the floor, but also earthly guys ever moved to the hair or ears, he had already regretted himself before years and has become excused.</seg>
<seg id="2921">However, to its honouring, however, such guardians must have been widely used in fragile time, the 1960s and 1970s, widely used to parents such as teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you know such breeding methods yet?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think each of us who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I have experienced this still in a world school, a state gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared with what it goes in this report, namely to the destructive sexual abuse and the violence at the preschool, the freilich Bagatellen are.</seg>
<seg id="2926">It is asking you whether it was not rather with his acquaintness and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI that many media have just moved on him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">At the Bavarian Pope, many of them who have never understood it, still jealous.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The truth is: the report relieve Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In connection with the report a lot about the subject of abuse during the Regensburger Domestic Policy was reported in connection with the report.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger in the final report also any processing or co-knowledge associated with regard to sexual abuse on the load?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: very much no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of the 67 victims of sexual assessments claims to have entrusted to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I never have forgotten me to speak with my father or my mother," "" "said a person responsible for the others," "" "it was all very embarrassing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem in the Enlightenment of sexual abuse was and is, that most of the victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they trusted not even parents and siblings, then definitely not a chorus, who would have been working as a collective of the perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do you rate the Domestic student of Ratzinger's role in terms of failure?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questioned student formulated this way: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case, in which he would have been able (Georg Ratzinger) timestable and could have been able to stop the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I think it... also for really absurd, to accept that... Buben ever or clearer or clearer, as opposed to their parents, internatssenior managers, confidentials etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks with him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "thus the report comes to the very clear result:" "" "that in advance to the affected students and / or their environment, the report could not be confirmed in the investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">In terms of sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is really free of charge.</seg>
<seg id="2943">So it cannot be accused him to prevent him or to display him.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore there is no reason to bring his good name with these rebellious crimes, as it was unfortunately happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">In the media there was a lot of "nonviolence" at the Regensburger Domestic Policy.</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused of "Wegener" in the report.</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this design?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: that's the great problem that miss everything missing and mentia in the coverage became a giant melange of sexually abuse and nonviolence and somewhere, in the middle, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this is exactly what is a misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">There is therefore clean separately: between the preschool and the gymnasium of the Domestic Policy, between sexual abuse and violence as well as, we say once, other incidents.</seg>
<seg id="2951">The report also covers incidents from the period since 1945, so also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not choral for Domestic atzen.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole horrible test pedagogy, the cases, in which young men of sac teachers have been regularly colored and malignited, all of them were present at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen where really scandalous states have to have reigned.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with whom Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he got the boys only to face when they were already at the Domspatzic school.</seg>
<seg id="2954">On the same as the very most witnesses were betaine, the theme of "Preschool" taboo.</seg>
<seg id="2955">It was only happy to be escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paraean" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different at the Domestic atzmar school?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was already discipline, but no longer-distal violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, at which the report comes to the conclusion that "many victims were estimating the general humanity of R., and therefore, in numerous cases, despite violence even positive reminders of him."</seg>
<seg id="2959">Only the allegation remains to have taken away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods, in which it was reported by the states on the preschool.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish and responsible for their predecessors at a school, which he had not worked and responsible for it (so the witness) would not hear anything, and then again in 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Georg Ratzinger stopped the ears in front of the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, since 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzymnasium who even reproduced the report.</seg>
<seg id="2964">He insists that in the preschool, he will continue to practice the test penalty. "</seg>
<seg id="2965">Already in view of the danger of negative pressuring public investigation, he was urgent inadequate.</seg>
<seg id="2966">That was of course at a time, as legal clarity, as a test in Bavaria had been banned in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that they took place in a legal grey zone, as each of us knows still white.</seg>
<seg id="2968">There was also heavy for him to estimate, where the sufferers were perhaps exaggerated or dramatic, and where really the permissible limit was exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But they can't say, he would have taken away always.</seg>
<seg id="2970">That is not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The test penalty was officially abolished in Bavaria in 1980.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Fürstin Gloria of Thurn and taxis claimed to apply today's pedagogical standards at the time of time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael Hesemann: we were talking about the "Fallout of Anachronism," so the danger of the past to present moral standards.</seg>
<seg id="2975">Since the princess has already right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this is true of course not for sexual abuse, who was abhorred at all times and also not for what was broken up in the preschool and violence against innocent children's school, that goes far beyond that time.</seg>
<seg id="2977">That's all really awful and I'm glad that it is finally closed.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection, because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means to discipline and Punishment, so earchers and ears to go to the hair and ears were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Then, as physical punishment then was forbidden, he also kept stripped.</seg>
<seg id="2981">What is the image of his regburger time Georg Ratzinger for the talks with you for the book "My brother of Pope"?</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the issue check out also for the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it's about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI, tells of his perspective, there the domains played only one side roll.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I don't forget that he conducted a new regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But also this must be said: without these perfectionism, without the unconditional discipline, it would probably hardly been possible to form a UNESCO World ambassador to form the true cultural ambassador in Europe and its musical tradition that went straight to the US (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With cookies and Bonbons alone, you have no big singers and in front of every success, right in which area, but always discipline, passion and self-windy.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Than what a person do you have experienced Georg Ratzinger on the talks at their book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: thanks to the work on the book and beyond that I experienced Georg Ratzinger really good and always to be wonderful, humorous, deep glazing and warm people, from whom you can't imagine that he could do something like a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I get regularly with how many former Domestic Policy still exists today, 23 years after his retirement, regularly visit him to visit him - he is almost blind - and he is as a member of their family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who did not forgive him today, that he once was strictly to them, are clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the domains are grateful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought to them the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he always had a good, väternal teachers - a stringent father, that may be, but it was a delightful respectful, to whom they still watch and honour them.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, even quite clear: everything that is necessary for him are educating methods that were at the time on the agenda.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be happy that we have long been overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is highly unjust, a man only because he is prominently and has a prominent brother to make a medial sin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the evil intention, that is behind, only going to be obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">Because the report that has just been published, relieves him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the attack area would have acquired a 93-year-old man who had acquired great merits and without the outside of Bavaria and maybe nobody wanted to know the Regensburger Domestic Policy, finally in peace.</seg>
