<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four cards that change your view to the city</seg>
<seg id="2">A wander-stalt, where youths are to meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A tomb chapel, where the tunnel is dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardeners manage the impact of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is nerves when landing cards are not currently.</seg>
<seg id="7">That knows everyone who had to be offended, because the Auto-Navi takes place a green meadow rather than the Auto-Navi.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bayern Atlases, an offer of Geoportas Bayern of the State Government, are all other than currently - but just therefore very inclusively.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when you compare it with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it is clear how cities and municipalities in the area of Munich Mercury has changed since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria Atlas is a flip-carpet, which is not equal to such as such as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the large oversight card we have been working for cities and communities more detailed cards, so-called Urphonic sheets.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the Bavarian surveying Administration, between 1810 and 1864, the first measurement of Bayerns were created.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leaders occupied Bavaria since spring 1800 during the Second coalition war with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted a overview of the occupied country and gave a topographic survey of Bavaria in order - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even if the French troops moved to Lunéville from February 9, 1801, they were the present neighbors who created the idea of a surface area of Bavaria-card.</seg>
<seg id="18">Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph drove the project further, founded the "Topographic Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian surveying administration.</seg>
<seg id="19">The document for Munich dates back to 1856 and is like all others at the Bavarian State Library.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison early / Today is in the example of the state capital at the most impressive.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded into all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">One example is submissions that is still isolated in the map of 1856 in the map.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was founded 21 years after the creation of the card, i.e. 1877, in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today Untersendling is located in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses submissions are located around 1856 along the Plinganserstraße, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where the Westpark is, you can see nothing as a fields - at first glance: when it appears on a smaller map with dutzing lines and numbers: handwritten entries from the so-called "Urintake" which was derived from the basic tax.</seg>
<seg id="27">There are no farmers in the land there today no farmers - but small gardeners of the plant "land in the sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area distinguishes north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, since 1810, was in the position of the Oktoberfest, was actually a meadow - and no concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the Urbonsleaflet, in the field of today's au-Haidhausen district, not only the street name "at the host" or from the height "on the fan" - but also in large letters "wander."</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the AuerField Road there were once people with honeys.</seg>
<seg id="33">There was in 1858 / 59 the Munich circle-Irrenanstalt "was created at the Auer fan."</seg>
<seg id="34">In 1872 Dr. Bernhard von Gudden managed the institution - the psychiatrist who brought to the death of King Ludwig II in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "he was advanced for its time and finished for example, to wander the so-called." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">In addition, he has led the personnel to apply violence against the occupants, "says Hermann Wilhelm, Head of the Museum Haidhausen, who employs an exhibition with the anstalt.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients there was first place, later it was extended to 500 places.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sometimes this capacity did not include this capacity - the reason for the construction of the Kreissparkling wine in the hair of 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">Since 2006 the Isar-AMPER-Klinikum Munich-Ost is one of the largest psychiatristles in Germany since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="40">At the age of the former Auer Anstalt, young people meet in Munich Salesianum.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and walked in a youth home with training.</seg>
<seg id="42">West is the football field of the TSV Munich East, east residential houses from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">In 2015, one built the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" - in architectural rejection to the original building of the Irrenanstalt, which was destroyed during the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="44">The Marienplatz was listed as "Head Square" in 1856, the department store called "Kaufinger street."</seg>
<seg id="45">A decisive change brought the Second World War also in the heart of the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="46">The allies of the Allies took many holes to the city centre in December 1944.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big continued until today - at Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business houses and a Gruftkapelle from the Middle Ages were once again at Marienhof, where these days will work on April 5, 2017 on the groundbreaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn line.</seg>
<seg id="49">The old Munich-map with the aerial photograph can be seen today with the aerial view of today - and the hole at Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil rights published rice-drying for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for Promoting Colour has issued a warning for colour people who travel to the discriminating policy and the racial attacks of the state to Missouri.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which is to enter into force until August 28, 2017, calls for afro-American travellers, visitors and Missourians, as a series of fragile, reconnaissance incidents in the entire country, and can be noted here," it is written in the opinion of the group.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently passed law of Missouri that it might make people serious, discrimination against discrimination, as well as the prosecutions of the state, which aim to queue to minorities, admittedly the group to release travellers, said the NAACP.</seg>
<seg id="54">"you have injuries of the civil rights that happen people.</seg>
<seg id="55">They are incubated because of their skin colour, they are defeated or killed, "said the President of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"we listen complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard."</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that the organization has been issued for a state in the US.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group cited incidents like racial insurrection against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died under fragile circumstances at the beginning of the year, after having taken no petrol during the journey through the state of Missouri, and was charged by the police in custody without a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also shows a recent report of the Office of the General Attorney General of Missouri in which black drivers will be more common in the state 75 percent more than white.</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware of people and their families, friends and employees what could happen in Missouri," said Chapel.</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "people must be ready to bring whether there are Kautsmoney or the relatives that they travel through the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">In 2015, Missouri recorded 100 Hasselt, according to the latest figures from the Hasselt I report of the FBI, who entered the state in relation to the number of such injuries to the 16th rank of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel time is also a response to a new Missouri Act that would be difficult to accuse a company because of residence or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had published travel regulations for Texas and Arizona, after the states of immigration authorities to suspend people to suspects people for immigration to further reinforcement authorities.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel regulations are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but during the last time, stakeholder groups have used the measure as reaction to certain laws and trends in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">Electric fence project is Elemental</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fischdezaun project is a successful project and will continue in the next year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU of the German Bundestag ordered Peter White and Kordula Kovac have a painting in front of the place.</seg>
<seg id="70">At the court excavation of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the CDU city council met together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann granted first insights into its operation, where he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 milk kisses and also many young animals and houses in five apartments.</seg>
<seg id="72">"" "the" "" "Schwarzwaldmilk" "" "is intended for him of the alternative advertising market for the milk of his cows, and Schwendemann." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the Ferihuts come exclusively regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">Since he is also important as the BLHV-Chairman of Fischherach, he called the electric fence as a "Elemental project."</seg>
<seg id="75">I can non-profit on derart steep areas.</seg>
<seg id="76">Green pastoral care for much work, much must be processed with the motor sense.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "we have here with the conditions and the topography" "", "emphasized Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003, he took over the eleventh operation and acquired this without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if he do not lead biooperations.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear:" "" "the Commune has recognized the meaning of the consecuity projects and is glad through the leader funding." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">At cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, the farmers would have to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">It is hoped that the view of the surfaces could be pulled out for a whole while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the greatest treasure we have, are people who work in agriculture and thought about how they continue to bring their operation," "" "stressed the mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">The farmers are often involved in criticism</seg>
<seg id="84">A total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">The disclosure surface is thus 40 hectares, which can not be stopped until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Of the total cost of 71 500 Euros, half of the leader was funded by leader, a quarter wore the community of Fischherach.</seg>
<seg id="87">In this way, the farmers had to invest 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16,2 kilometers of electric fence.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," declared Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "Kordula Kovac stressed:" "" "you do not make a good job, without farmers, and land virgins." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="90">Also for Peter White: "here the best food is produced."</seg>
<seg id="91">The State Court (LPR) Baden-Württemberg, the State Promotion of Weideceased.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is the retention of the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">Prerequisite is the presence of one of the LPR conveyors.</seg>
<seg id="94">Moreover, it must not be a tough area of waste management (hangbital above 35 percent) and must be threatened by the collection.</seg>
<seg id="95">For the 2018 Fischfence project 2018, the application of eight participants are currently running 24 plots, which would like to build almost 16 kilometres fence.</seg>
<seg id="96">The disclosure area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calendar costs are more than 112 000 Euro.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump is now taking the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest character of a regime change is if they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans estimate this as well as any other - therefore the fall-staged Saddam Hussone on the Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, knew what he did when he was a symbolic Axt in a heat dispute with Jim Acosta from CNN on the proposals of the drastic immigration to the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To stay fair, Miller didn't handle the statue himself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boilers and Liberty Imitators have suffered him, if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But in particular, he took their significance, and in particular the importance that her was attributed to the famous poem by Emma Lazarus, 17 years after the completion of the monument, its base was added.</seg>
<seg id="105">When Miller Acosta writes: "I don't want to enter a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that lightens the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem, which was added later, was added later, and not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is objectively right, but as he formulated himself, it's not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It goes around the contemporary resonance to the raised words of Lazarus, the only one in which a state not only invites any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your rubbish, your poor, and your poor masses, which are going to breathe freely, / the end of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time, in which the "elating waste" was better to see our screens better.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller was not involved in literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural conflict: it is indeed a conflict around the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus and her friends who had to place their words after their death in the base - did very well that they had a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and american republicism, in an unused classical style depicting the female bodiment of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem is the female figure no more abstract - it has a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she himself gives a different name: mother of Exilant.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on the American extra vism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just like Lazarus the meaning of the statue changed, people wanted to change the people from the right wing.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great cry as Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was paid, but rather an early neo-conservative, who wants to bring the American flame into the remuneration world: "Lady Liberty continues.</seg>
<seg id="119">It should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch shall not shine the way into the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual is limitgh here on anything.</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is quite and even a matter of perception of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative act of Lazarus was in it to see how they were seen from the exhausted, but hopeful people after long and often terrible trips on the Decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "" "" "it goes on the true sense to see the world from perspective of people who seek refuge and improve your chance to improve their lives." ""</seg>
<seg id="125">Her statue says to them the words of hope and the welcome that they must hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And that is of course not the perspective, the Miller and Trump ever want to know.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch shall not shine the way, but the hatred that is their only source of power.</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championship 2017: Neil Black is Scottish members of the United Kingdom</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle reminiscent of a time when only two sussers belonged to the UK team.</seg>
<seg id="130">The performance of the Athletics of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent of the world championship race "will afford a massive contribution to the team."</seg>

<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think that it has something to do with what they did.</seg>
<seg id="136">British Athletics: it has something to do what they did.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type on the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of the circumstances is, absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medallions, among them Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5.000 m route, while Eilidh Doyle was elected by the team to teamwork.</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eilidh is quite modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">Her surrender speech was incredible, "says Black.</seg>
<seg id="142">"a series of athletes, whether they were Scottish or where they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.</seg>
<seg id="143">The passion and the real feeling, the Eilidh was very natural, were great. "</seg>
<seg id="144">"" "the Commonwealth-silver medallists who compete in their fifth world championships with the 400-m hurdles" "" "says that it is" "" "that 16 Schotten in the British team are" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The middle-route Muir leads on this road and has set five European records last year in the past year.</seg>
<seg id="147">It will be able to participate in the 1.500 m and the 5,000 m runs.</seg>
<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare, which runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman who was looking for a great season to observe the victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle reminds me of their first world championships, when the only other Scotsman was in the team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">The trade capitals says that they are "enormously proud of the fact that many of their countrymen did not only belong to the team, but in some cases the medals and the finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">"" "" "" "the special thing about team surrender to be found that she was chosen by the other members of the team, but to know that my team mates voted for me and have chosen me, making it something very special for me," "" "she added to me." ""</seg>

<seg id="155">What my speech relate to Chapters?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think it went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation, since we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from it that we are back in the Olympic stadium.</seg>
<seg id="159">I get a second chance to go there and compete, and it simply will be so a great atmosphere there without. "</seg>
<seg id="160">Block from critics on Facebook: beats not for a public office, if you don't wear it from voters.</seg>
<seg id="161">The Father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it took not long until the newspapers struck him for all those who struck him up to his political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He shain about the critique, safe.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not put his critics to silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">Because in 1783 Washington said: "the speech can be taken away - and, silly and silent, we will be guided as the sheep."</seg>
<seg id="166">This brings me to Governor Larry Hogan, who must work to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union accused him early in the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The staff of governors dismissed the lawsuit as frivol, and the online comment was full of a return reaction with "Na," and?. "</seg>
<seg id="170">"it's only Facebook," said many people.</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important when it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican Governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is astonishing popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second most successful consent of the nation's 50 governors.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a fixed hand in the leadership of his state and strict compliance with the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very sent to use Facebook as a primary means to connect to his voters and play back his haarless head to chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore, the blocking of persons who come on the site of the governors - which is a public forum, which will be officially referred to and by employees who will be paid with public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post Defense Minister Amelia Chasse, he argued the actions of the governors and argued that the comments of comments is nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the image of wheels or water or water-filled people that force online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post spoke with some of the actual people that were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are only real people who speak with their chosen guide: a teacher, a businessman and a priest, no trolle.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said that their comments respectful and not professions.</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest cited the Bible in his post and appeals to Hogans of the Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Attorney at Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hassy, but she asked for Hasselt.</seg>
<seg id="186">"" "" "" "I felt polite that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to Hassle and other current news," "" "wrote in the commentary box of the news" "" "The Post" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="188">"" "what the staff of the governors as" "" "concentrated spam attack" "" "would be called" "" "other likely" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocks a critic or a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is a lot of cleaner than in previous time, if one had done the same thing that employees have been sent to collect newspapers with critical guides and to destroy and destroy them to silence.</seg>
<seg id="191">But it just happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public officials which is criticised that he has implicit Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is accused of Twitter users suffering from Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question fell last week in Virginia.</seg>

<seg id="197">This should not be so hard.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time, the time of the affordable portos had a similar effect as the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers spread between 1776 and 1800 between 1776 and 1800.</seg>
<seg id="200">And even Washington had an anonymous Trolle at that time.</seg>

<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Perhaps John F. Kelly can really do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">POLITICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to restrict the information flow on President Trump - including the reports of the media media - in hope to keep the boss on a uniform course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"" "" "" "when John F.

<seg id="1395">Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or paper - because the president would meet better decisions when he would get good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Cellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to perforate trump by using his media service.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumps relationship to television goes back for decades - and now where he is in the White House, its TV is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"" "" "" "if the candidate was offended because of an unfair coverage, it was productive to him that he received a fair coverage of jobs," said the former electoral consultant Sam Nunberg in February opposite POLITICO.</seg>
<seg id="1399">Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keep Trumps Twitter custom under control, according to six former election campaign civil servants consist of ensuring that his personal media consumption includes a steady lobbPrice."</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps Twitter custom is ever "under control," is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps this Kampagnenbeamten know what we do not know - that Trumps Tweets not contain any more spark plug without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will never see anything about Tweets that did not broadcast the trump.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his employees work it already some times, trouble from him, then their efforts have been worth it.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently prevent it that Trump Kontroverses calls.</seg>
<seg id="1406">A part of the problem exists that people in a White House, which consists of competing parties, always try to present their own agenda by adding trump material, which may be supporting their views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">POLITICO - throughout this story - reported in May on the preference of advisors to provide the president of strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example of the reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"" "" "" "current and former trump civil servants say that Trump can react to negative press components, especially such with damaged Lecks, and that he will find out to recover from whence they come." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1411">Although Johnson was banned from Twitter on Twitter, or that he has no specific evidence, or that he expressed in the past false allegations and contradict them.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and began to ask employee over Walsh. "</seg>
<seg id="1413">Goldmacher added that the former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary-General of the White House, Rob Porter, "tried to implement a system to manage and document the trump."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did this work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tempted three months later to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove himself as an effective manager as Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and its adviser are still under influence.</seg>

<seg id="1523">A danger for people don't go out of him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">How far the climate change has played a role in the slump of the ice, is unclear after research.</seg>

<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, the majority of many researchers could be merged with heating.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The broken Koloss was a part of the Larsen-C-Schelfeis so far.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Selfeis floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">Thus it grows again into the sea and breaks regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the top of the antarctic Peninsula.</seg>

<seg id="1533">It says some thing that the Larsen-C Schelfeis is in danger, because the front edge have never withdrawn as far as at present.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the iron plate stand under voltage and could fall in case of a piece of a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of Schelfeis and Eisberg increases the sea level, as they swim in the water and pushes the ice as much water as it yields.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the shot is that the glacier can be left straight into the sea and much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">That could possibly increase the sea level, however, only in the small size, the British research project to the observation of Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is according to AWI data with nearly 50 000 square kilometers, the fourth largest shame of Antarctica.</seg>
<seg id="1539">At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks regularly.</seg>

<seg id="1543">Under scientists have been controversial whether the Larsen-C-Schelfeis now return to a long term or long-term, said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added: "our models say that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even though this researcher did not return to climate change, so in the past decades a lot of ice cream of the Antarctic Peninsula are broken.</seg>

<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, expert of the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "the Lavendel in Provence has been effectively threatened because the plant was exposed to the effects of climate change, which has much less rain in the spring and much more.</seg>

<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to speak about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">It was told them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-ranking journalists discuss what you feel safe: they should take their children to the office which were in 2009 the goal of a attack with granules, or they are at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security professionals have written three words on a panel on the front of the room: opponents, neutrality, allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">You ask the reporter, named for any column - no evidence is necessary, trustables and abdominal.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug addeners, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected to stand on the salaries of government or cartels, a catalogue of criminals, which make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There are no peace break from violence, and while in all the country the corpses are frequent, there are more journalists: at least 25, since then President Enrique Pena Nieto received his office in December 2012. 589, after attacking and threats, there were at least seven deaths in seven countries.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter it is editor and her Inspirator of Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the biggest error is to live in Mexico and journalist," "" "wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books about violence in connection with drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His lack is deeply receiving, although its presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, which is based on the facade of the Riodoce building. two reporter in the three years, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts who show his smiling face with glasses or typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop will take place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, trauma, her nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Even though, in 2010, an Sonder-Federation was established to process the cases of journalists, according to the committee for the protection of journalists only two criminal proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As in most thouses of Morden, which are associated with drug trafficking and organizational crime every year, the murderers of journalists are only rarely taken before court.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodoce they still exist to treat the violence of Sinaloa, although they are irky and even though the terrain is still avenged.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information on the murderer, without justice, the meeting was the discussion of safety little benefits, Ibarra says Ibarra.</seg>

<seg id="1828">On the morning of the 15th of May, Valdez left the office of Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He only managed to drive a few blocks far from two men before his red Toyota Corolla was forced by two men and was shot on him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - who is translated with "12th river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The rest drove in his car and damaged it in the vicinity.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to be freely converted to Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But the topic of Valdez is practically nothing more than silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzmans arrest in the United States in January and the extradition in the United States in January, Sinaloa became one of the most bloody battlefield of the country, since rivalising fractions have to fight here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people on the street are shot or that the graveyard is filled out of enched, two-story mesheen for drug drugs, which are bigger than many houses for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "calm" if only a cartel has control over the coastal region with its valuable ports and drugs business in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, with the fault that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstanding have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First published in February the publication of a interviews with Damo Lopez, a leader of one of the rivalising cartography in the war with Guzmans sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have been missed the children, suspected the gangplers bought any copy of the edition as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kioske.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second error occurred in that Valdez did not force to force after the confiscation of another newspaper which had published the same story to leave the country on its own safety.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and its killing is considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had so long survived that his friends and colleagues annahmen that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He was in 2003 as an experienced reporter for Noroeste, when he joined Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars to the founding of Riodoce.</seg>
<seg id="1846">In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to operate journalism, without using the crawler problem," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1847">With the time, the newspaper served a reputation due to the courageous and honourable reporting, and sales and advertising.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters, hard-coming investigations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication where they could read stories that nobody else was to treat.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Mary-Moors-Cabot Prize for their coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Series' of the Committee for the Protection of journalists for his courage to persecute the Mexican drug history, where she still led them.</seg>

<seg id="1856">The Riodoce Team is Valdez, the Spaak, which was like a harbour worker, the friend who was generously with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>

<seg id="1858">He would always carry his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and there always sit on the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now they ask: was his love for routine his destruction?</seg>

<seg id="1866">When it is wrong, stay away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">The trouble is, the publisher of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal that "smell a sense that can be geted... and then it's the thing with Javier."</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, such as he and others say, apply in Sinaloa, no more - as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, in which a poisonous blend of lukrativen dirt, weak institutions and corrupt government officials.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape changes constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the room where the employees met by Riodoce for security training, suddenly there were no cell phones allowed. days earlier it became known that Spyware, who was sold solely to governments to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside, two policemen sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a middle class quarter of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the Scherz, some of the reporter, whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the policemen who are the governor itself as not trustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months ago, since the reporter went to the mountain scenery, where the drug bases are under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week, Riodoce has baked on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There were the assassination of the brother of the former artist Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé to the state spending, focused on the hometown of the Governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group that carried out in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the state-old district, an abduction.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word, who was kidnapped or as it happened, so it was careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favorite locally of drug traders and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public notes that the restaurant was registered under the name of a policy that belonged to the regnating Institutional Revolution Party (pri) who ruled almost the whole century all the political levels.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Several pri governors were accused of corruption because of high-quality cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">In Villarreal, Villarreal bat the reporter about previous incidents in this place, among them one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman went to a military failure.</seg>

<seg id="1886">The office of Valdez was dedicated to the storage space for signs and stickers, dedicated to the murder of journalists, because the staff had become something that they had never expected to say: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez schned a few signs and went on the next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist for the Office of the state.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed, in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>

<seg id="1891">On that day the director Bojorquez is gone in Washington and tries to collect international support for the justice in Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1892">During a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to destroy journalists and destroy them, because they have said the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has never been asked that they are redivided by the government because they concerned that their rage has violated their object.</seg>

<seg id="1895">In his last book "Narco-journalism," he wrote that reporters were not only killed by drugs, but also on the instruction of policies and security forces, which were with the organised crimes under a ceiling.</seg>

<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ theePharoah has been constantly based on their Timeline.</seg>

<seg id="2038">You booked a return flight and went to the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After landing at 23 o'clock, she took her 6-year-old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two next morning would pass after Ferguson.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the topic of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?," in the cinemas from the 11.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a history of survival and the Protestants, love and loss, the strength and resistance levels, which consists of the view of the people who live in the community and the streets filled to demand answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">In Ferrell with her daughter, who drove a flower dress and a matching crown, the two had a conversation that they had countless times in front of this morning "about the black experience and the black condition."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"" "" "" "you reminded you how many people have taught you, worshiped them?" "" "she remembered that which she spoke." ""</seg>

<seg id="2046">"that's what happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">They must know and see it, and it shall be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2048">It must be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also know the various layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we must do to free to free ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Even if I have lucky enough to give you a experience in which she personally experienced non-latant racism, it is not different than the next black women child.</seg>

<seg id="2051">The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was located at South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority, which was waiting for a camp, when the activists on the possible non-charge of Officer Darren Wilson was waiting.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There was Ferrell and her daughter joined with local business lovers, lunch made.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They made ready pockets before and halves to pass them to demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly began to accept a new kind of activism for Ferrell.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism has changed after the 9th of August," she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Ncourse Association and focused on essence of justice and health inequalities in black congregations.</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It is all come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later, Ferrell met Rorell during an evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2059">Folayan said, she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted only to document what happened.</seg>
<seg id="2060">A question came to Ferrell in the sense: "you want to document or tries to find a story that you can use it?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">This skepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often of white - in a community that benefited from their pain and its resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2062">Like Folayan recently explained in an interview: "we heard that people who were born in Ferguson and grew up, their voices were not centered and we wanted to make it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan had already worked together with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area, which is known for its activism in the death of death.</seg>
<seg id="2064">His commitment brought Ferrell the project closer together with six other locals followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after Browns.</seg>

<seg id="2066">"" "" "" "this was the main thing for me as those people are represented, for so I will be represented." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2067">The goal was not to concentrate on Ferrells experience - to show that there is not a Messiah leader, but by a fellowship, "said Folayan - she proved itself as the most obvious participants in the film.</seg>
<seg id="2068">They show documents of "Whose Streets?" surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrells life as she loves herself and marries her wife.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2070">"" "" "" "but I understood that there must be a certain interest in this work and the human rights of black people." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2071">In addition, Ferrells has repeated the role of the black gay women in the wider Black Lives movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founder of the movement, which have marked the film "BlacklivesMatter" in 2012, identifies the film "BlacklivesMatter" in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, pregnant women in leadership positions have borne the movement altogether," said Ferrell, "and therefore we fight at different fronts.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Black, pregnant women must bear the main load of everything. "</seg>
<seg id="2075">Folayan voted to notice that "the movement really is affected by black women and a lot of black women."</seg>
<seg id="2076">However, it insisted that "" "" this is not a result of the action of action, "" "" by Ferrell, due to its identity than the heart of the film. "" "</seg>

<seg id="2080">In the meantime, the news-cameras in Ferguson has long disappeared, but the rassical connections between the church and the police still exist.</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on parole for 2 ½ years because of the blocking of a demonstration at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">She describes the social atmosphere of the area that she calls her home: "a chaos."</seg>

<seg id="2094">While the fears is to build a gallery of more customers in the city, of which also the other business may benefit, fear the adversaries that then blow the pedestrian zone.</seg>
<seg id="2095">In addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the grounds, on which the peasant market hall stands, in which 13 directors are sold their products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">At the beginning of the construction, the end is finished.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The gallery Macher want to integrate a market hall in the new building - and for Beda-Platz with possibility of sitting outside.</seg>

<seg id="2110">But there is not even a regular weekly market there, it is so important that you will receive at least the market hall.</seg>
<seg id="2111">For all, the commodity is freshly offered, is mostly offered by the producer and is obendely inexpensive.</seg>
<seg id="2112">As you see, shop shops in a shopping mall are rented only by larger companies, because the dorm rentals are often not portable.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Too bad, special transactions, there are almost no more and what is left, then still disappear. "</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping mall with a market hall adapts me not together.</seg>

<seg id="2125">In the middle of the room of Fridman Gallery in New York many faces are to see - white, black and brown, which are almost unlimited - those on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupils and Haarle created by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent out the excerpts from prison Fort Leavenworth, where the former secret service analytics had joined a 35-year sentence, after she made diplomatic messages about the website of Leaks publicly.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition which opened on 2 August is called A Becoming Resemblance (An appropriate similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">It is the product of two years correspondent between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline has turned into their specialized expertise in technology, computer science and art, and maning, a transition from Barack Obama, when he had only three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg has been created by the algorithmic analysis of DNA from Manning and could not only look at the form of DNA data - the many ways to be interpreted and the inhardening determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, born when Bradley Edward was born, but already in their puberty open over the identification as a woman, was sentenced to 20 accents in 2013, including six violations of the spy law, computer was and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">By the prison, her picture was suppressed, so much that it was only a single photo - a grain, black-white selfie, in the maning is very well located on a driver and a platinblonde is wearing a platter - which it was associated with it.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came straight from the great success of their 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In this, the artist portraits of strangers made from forenical artifacts, such as cigar dumb and chewing gum, creating the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of it, such as these people could look like.</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time that she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"" "" "" "they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a sort of portrait to accompany this article," "" "Dewey-Hagborg declared a press review of the new exhibition." ""</seg>
<seg id="2137">And it could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed, so they took contact with Chelsea and asked whether they wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her mailed Muse were sent to invading Briefflude that lasted several letters over the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even looked one of Shoo Kanungo illustrated Comic "Supposimages," which had a future foreseen in which the president would come into judgment, and it would be able to see the exhibition personally.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama was actually only few days after the book was published, Mannings release after seven brutal years in a military hospital in Kansas, was a welcome way of happy food.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also now at the opening of the exhibition something deep and Starkes, da Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to find the construction that he should actually fix, continues to escape.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked after the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen in a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In one on the wall of the gallery, the artistic statement called Manning with its superior signature (the "i" in their family name) is an end of the "automatic ceremonies, whose foundation sex, race, sexuality and culture have been."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall, its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand-feet of Cs and Gs and As, in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg, hoped to show the inclusion of 200 letters (or nucleotide after the highly developed scientific Lexicon of the artist), like amazingly similar, at least in biological regard, we all are.</seg>

<seg id="2292">But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history of his comfortable seat in the watl River Valley in Kent and is now the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mopolitan Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.</seg>

<seg id="2296">It is not the first book of Rhodes, based on an archive: he wrote in 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he was unexpected.</seg>

<seg id="2580">Red flesh and chocolate can sound your digestive system like a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study claimed exactly the contrary: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The impetable condition that affects approximately 1.3 million and in Britain 300,000, caused magnets and flaps, recurring or bloody attacks, weight loss and extreme tiredness.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While the interested parties normally meet, meat and dairy products found to avoid their symptoms, researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins were to develop immunity to develop a tolerant intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leader researchers, Dr. Marco Colonna, declared that immune cells in the intestine patrol to ensure that harmful microbes that hide themselves in the body, not enter into the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are able to resolve inflammation, are balanced of cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">When balance is tend to inflammation in the direction of inflammation, it can result in a inflammatory effects.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments were determined that there is a type of tolerance dependent immune cell in mice that carry a certain bacterium in their bowels.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to resolve the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a connection between a bacterienart - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbians, and the development of a population of cells which promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had from these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">It struck that the combination of L. reuteri and one of tryptophan rich nutrition tolerates, less anti-inflammatory milieus, if the same system also wirt with people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The post-doctoral studies in Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan undertook a kind of immune cell which found the tolerance when they found that a group of study mice had such cells, but a different group of the same tribe that had been separated, that had not been separated.</seg>
<seg id="2593">They suspected that the difference was to do with the intestinal microbiomen of mice, viruses and fungi, usually live in the stomach-intestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The mice of mice were found DNA sequenzes and were found six bacterias which were present in mice with the immune cells, but without them were missing in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were removed in an sterilization environment, so that they were missing a intestinal microbiom and they did not developed these kind of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how the bacteria increased to the immune system, the researchers fed L. reuteri to grow into a liquid - without the bacteria - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells that were isolated from mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">Immunity cells developed to tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component of the liquid was cleaned, it proved to be a side-product of tryptophan Metabolism that is known as Indol-3-Miligic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers fed the amount of tryptophan in the food of the mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but if the tryptophan values were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan declared that people have the same tolerant cells such as mice, and that most of us L. reuteri protect themselves in our stomach-intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known if Tryptophan-side products made from L. reuteri the cells of people like in mice, but defects in relation to tryptophan were found in humans with anti-inflammatory effects.</seg>
<seg id="2602">She said, "The development of this cells is probably something that we want to promote, since these cells are inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potential tryptophan values in the presence of L. reuteri lead to a expansion of this population. "</seg>

<seg id="2865">Paris Saint-Germain had not left in their persecution by Neymar, after having approached an offer of £189 million to resolve his release clause, but they warned at Barcelona three years ago?</seg>
<seg id="2866">The sensational approach will be heated in the summer, because the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than the double of the previous brand, with Paul Pogba in the past season for 89 million pounds as Manchester United returned.</seg>
<seg id="2867">After completion, Neymar is the most expensive players in the world and the most paid professional sportsmen in the world. PSG offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week.</seg>
<seg id="2868">Barcelona is walled about the way, such as Neymar has given its way to outside, although a source near the Catalans executive board insisted that the club has always given its best to take care of him from Santos in 2013 to take care of him.</seg>

<seg id="2874">Barcelona seems to have exceeded this line with the Spanish association at the beginning of this summer interest in the PSG middle field player Marco Verratti.</seg>
<seg id="2875">PSG clearly made it that they would not allow to travel to the International from Italy under any circumstances and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by taking part in their price list for Neymar.</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domspatzen report dislastet Pope John Ratzinger"</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domain report on the abuse of the Pope John Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This is the author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the failure scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen ensures discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Assemble, spokesman of the reformist movement "We are church," explained by the former Regensburger Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93 year old brother of the emeritus of Benedict XVI.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would be willing to serve the Catholic Church, when Müller and Ratzinger would choose to express its deepenings on their own submissions or at the time false assessment of the processes.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"" "the Vatican Council" "" "Osservatore Romano," "" "however, criticised that during the reporting of violence with" "" "two" "" "measurement" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">Regarding the attacks in Regensburg, no one knows that it would have been prevented and damaged in the future; however, the "degree of medial manipulation," so the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historians and member of the national Italian Austrian Bioethics Committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the accustomed to mark the Catholic Church as a source of all evil experience, is already part of the everyday experience and prepares the public opinion that is to be normal for normal, writes Scaraffia.</seg>
<seg id="2897">Fürstin Gloria of Thurn and taxis said in the interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk: "one likes to go on the church and this is a second catch."</seg>
<seg id="2898">In addition, they pointed out that in their youth "slings have been a very normal educational means" to be done with freesting children, as I was one was ready to be finished. "</seg>
<seg id="2899">They are unfair, present the standards for earlier decades, because the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with reports about the abuse of missiles, Pope brother Georg Ratzinger also appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">"" "totally wrong, the author and historian Michael Hesemann, who talked with Ratzinger the" "" "My brother of the Pope" "" "(translated into 12 languages)." ""</seg>
<seg id="2902">"" "" "" "I must take Georg Ratzinger in the protection," "" "says Eemann," "" "for all that had nothing to do with him," "" "he evaluates the results of the final report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is the 440-page report, which the diocese was presented by the diocese Regensburg with the Enlightenment of Law Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">A total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were killed between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s "with high plausibility" victims of overtook, 67 domain names were sexually abused.</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report it is called Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "the summary, that by Domkapellmeister R. was applied in many cases of physical and psychological violence.</seg>
<seg id="2906">In case of high owatonality the punishment for students could also be violent.</seg>
<seg id="2907">In contrast to numerous others, many victims were estimated that many victims were estimating the general humanity of R. rated and therefore even more positive memories with him in numerous cases. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Eemann, why the final report of the Missy Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger of his opinion was declared.</seg>
<seg id="2909">"" "Mr Hesemann, the 440-page report on the" "" "incidents of Violence" "" "is a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger." ""</seg>
<seg id="2910">For a lift many students out his "Humanity."</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, he will also appear as a Choleriker and Perfection, the Öfteren handful, when a domain is musically produced no top performance.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate when his biographer report this final report?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you read the effort and read all the 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask ourselves, why the name Georg Ratzinger must first come in it.</seg>
<seg id="2914">It is just eight pages devoted to him and it is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of the medial or knowledge of sexual abuse of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The nonviolence at the preschool occurred outside of his active sphere.</seg>
<seg id="2916">You can count him from late, of which too late or first anguises have not been taken enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"" "the" "" "salvation" "", "heaven" "", "and" "", "" "", "heaven" and "" "better world" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">Thus, the vast majority of his pupils Georg Ratzinger is a very excellent record, describes him as "warm", "competent," competent, "competent," competent, "competent," competent, "competent," competent and bonbons "from the grapes of children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Merely a minority is worth over its perfectionism and its high owatonality that led to wutilize once again.</seg>
<seg id="2920">So that he did not just threw the keys and the keys, but also earnest on the ground, but also earnest care of hair or ears, he has already been settled even before years ago, and was sorry for itself.</seg>
<seg id="2921">However, in his honor, however, such corrective methods in fragmenting time, the 1960s and 1970s, were widely distributed, with parents such as teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think each of us who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also have experienced that in a world-worldly school, a state Gymnasium, experienced.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what actually, in this report, namely, sexual abuse and nonviolence at the preschool, are the freili Bagatellen.</seg>
<seg id="2926">There one can already ask if it was not more likely to do with his acquaintness and his role as brother of Benedict XVI, that many media just fell upon him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">On the Bavarian Pope, many who have never understood it, still more eiving.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report von Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In connection with the report a lot about abuse during Regensburger Domspatzen has been reported in connection with the report.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Becomes Georg Ratzinger in the final report also any processing or knowledge in relation to sexual abuse of load?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: very clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of the 67 victims of sexual survivors claims to have entrusted to the domain name.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I never thought to speak with my father or my mother," "" "said a person representative for the others," "" "It was really very embarrassing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem in the Enlightenment of sexual abuse was and is that most victims originate from Scham.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they trusted not even by parents and siblings, then not a chorus of chorus, who had been a colleague of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do you evaluate the Domain student Ratzinger's role in terms of missiles?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questioned students formulate it so: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case, in which he had expected to be missed (Georg Ratzinger).</seg>
<seg id="2939">I think it... also for truly absurd, to accept that... Buying urgent or clearer, or rather opened, as opposed to their parents, internatsleiters, confidentiality, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks with him over sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">Thus the report comes to the very clear result: "that in advance to affected pupils and / or their environment, could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation."</seg>
<seg id="2942">So, what sexual abuse is Georg Ratzinger is free from everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2943">So you can't be accused him not prevented him or to display it.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore, no reason to bring his good name with these contracted crimes in connection, as it happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">In the media there was a lot of "nonviolence" to read "Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former domain name Georg Ratzinger is accused in the report "Wegener."</seg>
<seg id="2947">Must he live with this approach?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: this is the great problem that, in the reporting period, was mixed with a huge melange from sexual abuse and nonviolence and somewhere in the middle of the Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But that's exactly this is a misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">There is clean separately, between the school and the Gymnasium of the Cathedral-atzen, between sexual abuse and nonviolence as well as we say once, other occurrences.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Furthermore, the report dates from the time since 1945, thus also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not choral director of the Cathedral.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole awful test pedagogy, the cases, in which boys of seasonal teachers have been controlled and malignited, were all involved in the school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really skandalous states have to have reigned.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with whom, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, for he got the boys only to face when they had already been on the domain name.</seg>
<seg id="2954">On that, as most of the witnesses of witnesses, the theme "Pre-school" taboo. "</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy, you escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paraitalian" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different from the domain store?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Eemann: since there was a discipline, but no seasonal violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report comes to the conclusion that "many victims of the general humanity of R. estimates and therefore, in many cases, even positive reminders with him."</seg>
<seg id="2959">So it remains the way to have gone away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods, in which it was reported in the state of the school.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time 1970 / 71, when he had just began to establish and from the predecessors at a school where he had not worked, and was not responsible (so the witness) wanted to hear, and then again at 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Swallowed Georg Ratzinger consistently the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, since 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2964">In this case, he indicates that in the preschool will continue to be practising the test penalty. "</seg>
<seg id="2965">Due to the risk of negative presets, he urgent inwards.</seg>
<seg id="2966">That was of course at a time when legal clarity was previously banned in Bavaria since then.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that they had occurred in a legal gray zone, like every one of us know.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was also difficult for him to estimate, where the affected people may exaggerated or dramatically, where actually the permissible limit was exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But one can't say that he would have gone away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">That is simply not right.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The test was officially abolished in Bavaria in 1980.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Fürstin Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it is unfair, today to apply today's pedagogical standards.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael Hesemann: we are talking about the "Falluck of Anachronism," so the danger to evaluate past today's moral standards.</seg>
<seg id="2975">Since the princess has already been right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this does not apply to sexual abuse, who was abstained at all times and not for what was broken in contradiments and violence to innocent children's nursery, which dates back far beyond that time.</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all very horrible and I'm glad that it is finally finished.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection, because all that had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means to discipline and punishment, thus earneon and to pull the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">As a physical punishment then he was forbidden, he has also kept it.</seg>
<seg id="2981">What picture of his Regensburger time has Georg Ratzinger for the talks with you for the book "My brother of the Pope"?</seg>
<seg id="2982">Came the subject of testing for language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI, told from his perspective, since the domain names played a side roll.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I didn't know that he led there a stricter Regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But this also must be said: without this perfectionism, without the demand for unconditional discipline, it would be hardly possible to form national cultural ambassador for Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With Keksen and Bonbons alone, one finds no great singers and before each success, equal to which area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What people do you have experienced by Georg Ratzinger at the talks about her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond, I really know George Ratzinger really well known and again experienced a wonderful, humorous, basic and warm good people, from which you can't imagine that he could do something like a fly something.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I'm getting regularly with how many former domain names still today, 23 years after his Emerging, regularly contact with him, visit him - he is almost blind and him as a member of their family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who did not forgive him until today, that he was once strictly too much to them, so are definitely in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most Domspans are grateful to him today that he enriched her life and brought them the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that it is always a good, vehemently teacher - a strenger father, forget that it might be - but also a pleasant respectful respectson, who still looked at today and honour them.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, at once again clearly: everything you have throws, are educated methods that were on the agenda at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have long been overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it's highly unjust, a man, only because he is prominently and one more prominent brother has to make for the medial fall of sin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the evil intention that stands behind it, but it is obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">For the report, which was just published, discharged him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the rising areas, a 93-year-old man who had acquired great services, and without the outside Bayerns and perhaps nobody wanted to know the raensburger Domspatzen station, finally in peace.</seg>
