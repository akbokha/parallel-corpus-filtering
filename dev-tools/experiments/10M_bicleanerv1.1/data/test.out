&quot; &quot; &quot; the brother of the sacrifice said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he could not imagine that he would hurt him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he went up again with him again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the body of San Francisco was founded on Wednesday tomorrow at the West@@ field Mall in San Francisco , divided into San Francisco by the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Frank Gal@@ icia in San Francisco .

a speaker of the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ gh@@ ters said that she sho@@ cked over his death , and destro@@ ys itself on the ground . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a small team that works like a close family and we will miss him painful &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our thoughts and our supplement are in this heavy time at Fran@@ ks family and friends .
Louis Gal@@ icia gave birth to Frank first in host@@ els , but that , &quot; the things for him finally went uphill . &quot;
&quot; he found an apartment , he had a friend , &quot; told Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO .
Louis Gal@@ icia said that he could not imagine that he would hurt his younger brother .
he was a friendly man with a great heart .
his kind to connect his family , it was always something to cook for us to prepare dinner , &quot; said Louis Gal@@ icia .
he never wanted to participate in any kind of meditation .
he was the brother who sw@@ am with the river .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in everything that goes wrong in the world , he was this un@@ cut diamond that sh@@ ined every day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
everyone who has information on the case , the SF@@ PD is asked to call the serial number of the SF@@ PD under the number 415 @-@ 575 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
J@@ enni@@ fer An@@ ist@@ on : I am always plug@@ ged in drawers
J@@ enni@@ fer An@@ ist@@ on must not always be perfect or successful .
that &apos;s the Hollywood star in an interview now un@@ ob@@ under@@ stand@@ able .
&quot; I am always plug@@ ged in drawers , or leave the outside label to do with me and reality usually little to do . &quot;
&quot; I myself don &apos;t have the wish to be perfect and successfully . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ est , these things are more quick . &quot;
J@@ enni@@ fer An@@ ist@@ on ( 47 ) can only laugh at that they considered &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as they declared in the current &quot; Cos@@ mop@@ olitan . &quot;
most beautiful , the act@@ ress brings her time at home , the TV with lo@@ cker@@ em D@@ utt and Mexican food , is called it in the magazine .
to white blood , they bring the question after the children &apos;s request : &quot; we must not have married or children to be perfect , &quot; so the Hollywood star .

Gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the sports pil@@ es
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger , with some colleagues a bit di@@ version with a ride on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden Sport@@ pyr@@ am@@ ides &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after some minutes the horses remembered her closing , they hunt for fast Gal@@ lop at home to the fe@@ ar@@ ches .
a kilometer at this temp@@ o , I &apos;m afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger .
and thus the equ@@ est@@ rian career ended again .
on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer of all time - 101 tournament victories - again close to horses .
he left his family through the family of the AL@@ RV , on a horse , he didn &apos;t get to photo two .
long was the first time in Aachen and thus at CH@@ IO .
the reason was absolutely convincing .
the German sports aid delivered the man from An@@ hausen in the framework of a small gala &apos;s Golden Sport@@ pyr@@ am@@ ides .
in awards it won &apos;t miss the sympath@@ etic athletes .
Federal For@@ ced Cross , Silver Lor@@ be@@ er@@ blatt , Champions Tour Player of the year ...
even the British Queen has already left him .
long is the 18th lau@@ re@@ ate of the Sport@@ pyr@@ am@@ ides .
in Aachen he met on Saturday the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award is very much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for she is not only for spor@@ tive successes , but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lan@@ ger has been supporting the offspring since decades .
and so he also gave the prize money of EUR 25,000 .
with 15 more outstanding athletes , the two @-@ time US Master winner was recorded on Saturday in the &quot; Hall of Fame of the German Sports . &quot;
among the recorded records the athletes of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the F@@ ew Eber@@ hard Gi@@ enger , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the Spr@@ j@@ ka Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ thum@@ ously the hand of all Erhard .
many of these sports fans came on Saturday to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the lively society in the Spring@@ stadium , where the Lav@@ az@@ za Prize ran .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger held a distance to the large animals .
Clin@@ ics and Tr@@ um@@ ps Economic Policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and prevent the T@@ TP trade agreement - that &apos;s going to be Clinton as well as Tr@@ ump .
however , the two US presidential candidates are however with the tax and energy policy as well as in a basic request .
the differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hill@@ ary Clinton under@@ lies a fundamental , more philosoph@@ ical difference .
the role of the state .
Tr@@ ump wants to keep in doubt rather small and war@@ ns before , as the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulation .
Clinton compl@@ ying the economy to death and to be put to death , he says .
he himself would be different , claimed tr@@ ump .
he will return to rule , and he makes himself strong tax reform with lower tax rates strong - for private professionals and for businesses .
Clinton says : the state has certain tasks to accompl@@ ish , he has the dis@@ advant@@ age@@ ous chances and needs money .
therefore , taxes for the rich will increase , says it .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic of infrastructure .
in which the needs to be invested , Tr@@ ump and Clinton say almost wor@@ t@@ equal .
the democratic applic@@ ants announced the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programmes in the infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are rejected by the nation@@ alized Te@@ v@@ y wing of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
so on Tr@@ ump , there might be still one internal discussions .
the differences in energy and climate policies are significant .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal plants and return coal extraction in the US again .
oil extraction is also possible to date protected areas in the protected areas of the climate agreement in Paris .
Clinton wants to expand the renewable energies with their investment program and demands : &quot; a country becomes the super @-@ making of clean energies and create million jobs . &quot;
&quot; it is probably either China , Germany or America - I want that we are there . &quot;
but not only with the infrastructure - even at international trade agreements , both competitors are not too far away from each other .
T@@ PP , which will not sign azi@@ a trade agreement , do not want to sign .
at the same time , both the USA do not want to isol@@ ate from international trade , but simply protect American jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they should then be paid better than Clinton . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the current minimum wage of 7,@@ 25 US dollars is a hunger strike .
it intends to increase it to 15 dollars per hour .
what are Tr@@ ump in this question is not clear : once he says : the minimum wage must be changed , he says he shall not be changed .
but the great discussion of the coming months is likely to develop well in order to develop the two camps .
on one side , Tr@@ ump , who wants to load the economy and the citizen to boost growth .
his critics keep him before , so that the budget deficit would only be bigger .
on the other hand , Clinton who wants to ask at least of the rich he wants to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution .
escape : &quot; any wing@@ ed woman has experience with sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence belongs to women who escape the alone almost every day .
if they arrive in Germany , they are often trau@@ matic .
a house offers refuge .
there are four women in a big kitchen .
each baby has a baby , which is not one year old .
one has put their little son in the arm .
he sh@@ ines with great eyes curious in the room .
his mother star@@ red on the table top .
until they noticed that it is observed .
she sm@@ iled , and kissed the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until one speaks with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
it is part of the Con@@ dro@@ bs division , a carrier for social relief offers in Bavaria , and deals with the subject of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are poultry .
they live in the Munich north in one of the few de@@ centr@@ alized accommodations for all women and their children in Bavaria .
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs moved up together with Pro Familia and the Munich Frau@@ enh@@ ilfe .
recently it was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men do not exist - also not as visitors .
the exception is a watch@@ man in front of the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every woman who comes here has made her escape with sexual violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; men flee because of wars because they are polit@@ ically persecuted , because of them torture or death , or because their families have sent them to Europe as a hopes for their families . &quot;
in women , other reasons for the escape : &quot; many steal herself secretly , because they don &apos;t see any other way . &quot;
in their home they have experience with sexual violence , forced , hon@@ our@@ able , honor of Hon@@ or , slavery or forced dis@@ stitution .
that drives them away .
on the run , it goes on .
&quot; that tugs for a bottle of water require a sexual action , is no rarity , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
who think that the end , as soon as they anchor in Germany , ir@@ re , tells B@@ ahr .
in this way , women in refugee were often considered to be min@@ der@@ ous and worse .
this leads to that about 90 per cent of women who live in the north in the north of the North of the North , estimates them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntary &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women were so usual that they say nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or not trust himself to speak openly about the earth , because the shame is too large . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often didn &apos;t help to help , there is more accommodation for them , calls for B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , the seven county ra@@ ins are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
to the question whether they live by a similar project such as in Munich in their jurisdiction range , answer some with no .
in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz region and Ober@@ fran@@ ken , there is no something about the governments of the governments .
in Schw@@ aben alone , women fled not separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , press brie@@ fing of the government .
in Upper Bavaria , underwater and medium @-@ fran@@ ken are available in some common floors or houses only for single @-@ standing women and their children .
the exception is Nieder@@ bay@@ ern , there are two central accommodation units exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also the Committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rights of women and gender equality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women to be accommodated separately from men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a study published for the Committee , it says : &quot; it is very important that men and women can be arranged separately . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the privacy or are men and women together , it may come to - for@@ warding violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the shower room should be separated and easily accessible for women , stands in the study .
how much the women feel the need of these protective need , you can read the And@@ ur@@ ge , which gives it to the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since it has been spoken that there is us , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one could easily create a second house .
assistant doctors strike : requirements according to new working pressure measures
vice @-@ chairman of the assist@@ ants have called their union to discuss new labour measures with their disp@@ utes regarding a new treaty .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) adopted its entire Council from the beginning of September more working measures .
the J@@ DC told that there would be ministers to enter the concerns relating to the contract .
assistance and medical assist@@ ants have voted in July about the re@@ jection of a contract which was agreed with the BM@@ A .
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who have voted in the elections .
in a letter to members who was released on Thursday evening on Twitter , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court , announced that the government had remained quiet &quot; problems that led to the contract was rejected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; considering the J@@ DC Executive Board , the proposed new contract has completely eradi@@ cated the proposed agreement and official new negotiations for all marri@@ ages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an answer to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC board appointed a formal application for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to meet a running program es@@ cal@@ ating work measures that starts in early September .
the disp@@ utes led to that assistance in this year would strike six times in the history of N@@ HS .
the head of the BM@@ A assist@@ ants Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana joined the election of the agreed contract conditions that were recommended by the BM@@ A .
he shared BM@@ A members during meetings that took place before the vote by 54@@ .000 assist@@ ants and medical studies that the contract may be beneficial and accepted .
following the vote , the health minister Jeremy Hunt was that the contract for doctors in England would be forced .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; Alliance of Foreign Affairs &quot; ?
it was a gest@@ ure that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce their hands and pro@@ claim an official end of the eight @-@ month @-@ long war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin took his Turkish opposite player in the gilded hall of St. Petersburg Pal@@ ast@@ es in reception , I can &apos;t for@@ bid that Ankara wants to hold this reconciliation in most .
there was the r@@ ash , yes .
but Putin met the sm@@ iles nar@@ row@@ ly and he sh@@ ines almost heat from itself , even for its rest@@ rained conditions .
in contrast , Recep Tayyip Erd@@ og@@ an talked about his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin , according to a report about five times .
I couldn &apos;t count it anymore .
he also promised that relations with Russia could not only return to their old level before the crisis , but even to improve itself .
on the next day a news described that Erd@@ og@@ an would have had such thought than it would never happen anything .
to me the enthusiasm appeared to me rather than the contrary .
but one of Putin showed that sustainable cooling showed that the Russian President of Russia had forgotten nothing .
rather , the crisis of the crisis was the first what he mentioned in his project : the surplus of a Russian campaign aircraft in the Syrian border through Turkey .
in Moscow in response to the time it was cold @-@ bran@@ ched .
Putin shared from and accused Ankara to have fallen into the back .
this was even greater , since it was committed by a friend &apos;s friend .
the show@@ cases re@@ build will be difficult if not even impossible .
the public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , the state controlled media led a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
at once it seemed , the Turks would bear the debt for everything .
on serious officers , the alleg@@ ations of senior officials were that Erd@@ og@@ an &apos;s own family had benef@@ ited from illegal oil trade in the areas of Syria , which will be controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he fought this v@@ eh@@ ement .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
after all , this meeting was therefore only taking place because Putin received the President Erd@@ og@@ an to exc@@ use the exc@@ use that he wanted to hear .
Russia could book a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ ase@@ fire is clear on the hand .
Erd@@ og@@ an is needed in the first line of all friends who can get in a coup d &apos;@@ etat with a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
again , terror attacks on Turkey have also sh@@ aken him .
but there are also economic moti@@ fs .
Russian sanctions have met Turkey hard - especially the prohibition of char@@ ms , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year .
the number is decreased by almost 90 % .
in Russia , travel agents and charter companies will be facilit@@ ated when flights will be resum@@ ed .
they count towards a late relay of the Mediterranean .
this week predicted the State television cheaper fruit and vegetables , once the Turkish agricultural imported will be allowed again .
a report in Ve@@ demo@@ st@@ i formulated it as follows : &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is a weak response to the West , since its response to the attempted power was considered a weak answer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the persist@@ ing gro@@ unding over the EU Acc@@ ession negotiations and Putin - the pi@@ ping on it is to withdraw from the cool mood and to reduce the relationship from Turkey to the West . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Ankara , Russian Heads of State won a bonus that he demanded after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat for the chosen state of State .
this is beneficial for Moscow to change a self @-@ sitting fear of Reg@@ im@@ e@@ ania .
the summit in this gl@@ itter@@ ing palace made it possible to Russia and Turkey , one , as it once described me a analy@@ st , &quot; Alliance of external lateral places . &quot; two countries that are led away from the West and is feeling bad .
nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two still .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently given the role as peace offerings , but where Russia and Turkey supported mutual pages .
it could be stri@@ ving that after almost three hours of initial discussions on the Press Conference , they said that they did not count once again .
the president of Turkey promised to answer a question about their differences , while Putin decided to emphas@@ ize them .
there is no unique con@@ sens@@ us to be found where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open host@@ ilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster when NATO member Turkey den@@ ounces the Russian fighting jet - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State or at least once again speak .
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside of Scotland no longer available
according to the Chairman of the Bank , the R@@ BS brand will be to be reduced to a Back@@ office role according to the Board of Directors .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside of Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan opened the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was linked to the Bank &apos;s global traffic positions .
since then , the Bank has already been dist@@ anced when it had to be saved and saved almost eight years ago .
in this period , brand contest &quot; R@@ BS &quot; used to protect other end consumer markets .
it supported the international sport with millions of pounds on sponsor@@ ship , from the Six Nations Rug@@ by until the Wimbledon winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now they decided to take more national brands in the focus of the event .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available for customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the de@@ centr@@ alized headquarters and the stock markets are changing to Nat@@ West .
the Ul@@ ster Bank &apos;s brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other major brands for the private customer , which will be more significance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ WAN was inter@@ viewed during a tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Sh@@ ire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brand RS@@ B is represented at our investor stamp and the brand to be employed by our staff , since we will now become more about a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
R@@ BS became the global brand for itself as the Bank itself .
I say now that we do not pursue global objectives but local targets .
each of these brands will stand in their own congregations for something completely different and our employees will work among these stamps with the customers .
R@@ BS has already announced that it will not continue to continue its six Nations sponsor@@ ship , and that it will increase the ability of different brands in his sport Spon@@ sor@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is time for us to develop into the bank of brands , as we concentrate on inside ( we asked asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been very delicate three years ago when we said that we will be a great bank for our customers and launched these stamps .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes .
we can sign these stamps again , so I think that the time has come .

Russian Putin fired Chief of Staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov
the Russian President Vladimir Putin has dismissed un@@ expect@@ edly his staff of Staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was many years part of the nar@@ row@@ est confi@@ denti@@ ality of Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed special representative for environmental and transport matters .
in an opinion of the Kre@@ m@@ L , Putin is said that Putin was ordered for the release of his duties as chairman of the Russian Presi@@ dential Administration . &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who was a deputy deputy since 2012 , was appointed to his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
in 1972 , in the Estonian capital of Tallinn , he graduated from the renowned state of the Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Tokyo Embassy in Tokyo .
on the website of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , it says ( in Russian ) that he was later protocol director of the government of the government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said to Putin : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think it is the most important role of the government to support your activity as a leader regarding Legislative Decree and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday , that Ivan@@ ov was asked to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
convince the sm@@ iling faces ?
this step has made mysterious secrets .
Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov was a long time in the nar@@ row@@ est trusted Vladimir Putin and works as he was responsible for the Soviet secret service , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin , who was broadcast@@ ed in television in a meeting , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff is returned to his own request .
but despite the harvest for the cameras , there are only few of them convinced - especially in front of the legislative elections .
so is the consequence of a kind of power ?
that knows no one knows .
but the official statement - that a man who once again declared as potential President when Russian environmental policy would like to lead to large sk@@ ep@@ tic@@ ism .
in his remarks on Putin , which are quoted on the Website of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , Ivan@@ ov said it is true that I was asked to trust in a conversation with me this very complicated post - you could almost say - protect it for four years .
as it represents , I have been chairman of the Russian Presi@@ dential Administration for four years and eight months .
Ivan@@ ov took the post in December 2011 .
he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin as a member of the State Security Service of K@@ GB .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his deputy .
when Putin met his power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people who trusted in most of them .
once , Ivan@@ ov could have been President of Russia after Putin &apos;s second term of term , as a third term Putin had to cast Putin &apos;s third office in Turkey .
but this post was taken by another , close allies Putin , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became Prime Minister until he became a President in three and a half years later .

a inhabit@@ ant of Ban@@ ff asked for the identification of the fish help , who di@@ pped in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain th@@ inks that it could act with the 75 f@@ ishes around Sand@@ a@@ ale , which were donated by a fountain .
Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , published a video of the spect@@ acle in hope that someone might throw some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish .
Que@@ ens@@ lav@@ Cross@@ ing : bridge now connected with Fi@@ fe
the project is expected to be completed by May 2017
engineers have linked the Nord@@ deck of the Que@@ ens@@ lav@@ ender with the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - what means that the bridge is now associated with Fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four closing of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; covers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which the completion of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons .
it has 10.000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 scra@@ p valves .
the project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017 .
the Federal Minister of Economics K@@ eit@@ h Brown took a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country on the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is a historic and symbolic moment at the construction of the Que@@ ens@@ ed Cross@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all the witnesses of a engineering art with a truly ep@@ ic dimensions in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the canal is the completion between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck , which require extreme precision tolerances for the fit .
in total , nearly 79 % of the total Br@@ ück@@ er@@ cks are on their place and the last section of the deck is now in Ros@@ y@@ th a Bet@@ ong@@ ation for the deck , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted up on the bridge .
Michael Martin , project leader of For@@ th Cross@@ ing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; the first buck@@ le represents a considerable milestone in each bridge project .
in this fantastic project , the closure of the pione@@ ering high and deep construction represents .
after installation of the last street cover@@ ings and whose connection with the expansion in the north @-@ tower @-@ deck , we had to close the existing gap at the North or Land@@ side .
this was reached by pulling the northern Pacific bridge 700 millimeters south .
this was a massive and very nice work at the same time .
massi@@ vely because the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct 222 meters long is , about 6,000 tons weight and had to be pulled down with an incline of approx . 3 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ cle , because the tolerances that the team works , at each side , they were only a few millimeters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lu@@ ck@@ ily everything was very good .
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay : three men have to be lucky enough to be alive . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; happiness nor to be alive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after they were thrown out of their fishing boat to the Angl@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e R@@ N@@ LI rescue unit proposed on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T alarm after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay .
the three men had difficulties to swim in safety while their boat moved from their own power .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw how the boat arrived at her proximity and set up the worst thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the leader of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; than@@ k@@ fully the winds of the boat had already been awak@@ ened out of their range until we left to water , &quot; he added .
two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhau@@ sted at the age of 60 and was found at a boat without li@@ fe@@ jacket .
they all arrived on board of the coast of coastline and were brought back to the ambul@@ ance station
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Jones said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men who were thrown into the water have happ@@ ily injured and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boat engine had an emergency stop@@ pl@@ a , however , dis@@ band@@ ed the boat from the Bo@@ ots of the person who controlled by the boat .
someone asked today about these men .
seriously wounded - man st@@ ole on his ex @-@ gir@@ l@@ friend
a man attacked his ex @-@ gir@@ l@@ friend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and seriously wounded .
as the police split yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had given the key to the apartment to get his personal things .
instead the alcoholic perpet@@ rator perpet@@ rator the clothes of his ex @-@ gir@@ l@@ friend .
when they came into the apartment , he moved twice on them .
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured in the hand and the body .
police could take the perpet@@ rator .
while the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed the clothes of his ex @-@ gir@@ l@@ friend , he called his mother .
this al@@ arm@@ oured then his sister .
together with their lifetime , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm their brother .
but she couldn &apos;t move it to the apartment .
so they went with her life at the house .
on the road they met the ex @-@ li@@ fel@@ ess of man .
when the two women rest@@ rained the apartment , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old has his sister to the side and took his ex @-@ gir@@ l@@ friend .
who builds Braun@@ schwei@@ gs apartment ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and Green said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; investors should be made much stronger in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 favorable apartments in the next few years ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD proposes the next rating meeting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hand@@ s Concept &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but stri@@ fe is programmed .
the first line is about the question : who is supposed to build the affordable housing ?
a regulation is missing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD faction president Christoph Brat@@ mann said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are one of the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build on urban areas , 20 percent of all apartments have to be considered social apartments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the affordable housing can also be created in the hol@@ dings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the major dispute in the town hall was however , such as a viol@@ inist : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how does one go with investors to build private areas ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to invest investors at least 10 per cent , but as possible as 20 percent of the apartments are building as social apartments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new city housing programme , which will cost million costs and is to be financed to incenti@@ ves .
the problem , so Fr@@ mann : &quot; there are currently no agreement between the fra@@ ctions . &quot;
the CDU wants to make investors as few rules .
the lens will still have hardness levels for investors .
regardless of his , so Fr@@ mann , whi@@ pped a dis@@ appearance of the situation on the housing market .
if the action concept is implemented , this will ensure additional tasks in the building management .
more staff is needed .
it is un@@ clear whether we will get the skilled workers .
but the program does not stand completely : for the approximately 1260 new apartments that should be built @-@ in .
but how do you compare the loss of further around 1300 inexpensive rentals , whose funding will be out in the next few years ?
by 2020 alone , it will be 500 apartments .
to prevent this , the plan@@ etary spokes@@ person Nicole Palm , should now be purchased from the city &apos;s progress .
in addition , it should also be thought to pick up apartments back into the price integration .
this is possible in the West Gate .
to a blow the problem will solve .
the West German city run at the end of the year .
around 1800 apartments you could get back to the price binding for cheap apartments .
just : this is the owner , the housing companies do not want .
because the number of social apartments in the West Gate is dra@@ stically increased , removed from the target of the so @-@ called .
a concentration of social sh@@ aking in just a few city parts shall not give it anymore .
the Gre@@ ens do so that there will be movement in the discussion .
Group vice president Holger Her@@ lit@@ ch@@ ke comments : &quot; for a broad majority , the CDU with the boat must go into the boat . &quot;
I have focused on more buildings for family homes .
but what does not mean that yet a compromise can be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunting after health and happiness that pays off
it is in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ing to see how the world changes .
that teen@@ ager and child for games no longer go out to go out , but rather prefer to spend their leisure time , on screens to rigid , was pro@@ claim in the last decade of many .
at Pok@@ em@@ on Go it is going to get people from the sofa and be active .
the time at the screen was initially limited to the TV , then on video games and most recently to smartphones .
therefore it &apos;s great to see that technology and activity do not exclu@@ de their activities in the open .
I joined the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , which is based on the characters , first created for video games in the 1990s ( later produced a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ off ) .
how many phenom@@ ena of pop@@ culture sank the interest before the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand in early July .
the market launch in other countries was post@@ pon@@ ed by massive demand that over@@ loads the server .
within a few days Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is more user than Tin@@ ym@@ ns and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , players with their smartphones go out to the outside and search for Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons , who are persecuted with a GPS , as soon as they were found once , &quot; photograph@@ ed &quot; ( over a screenshot on the phone ) or &quot; captured &quot; can be taken .
one generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the wake up and j@@ ump@@ ed for the search of the sofa .
in the US , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that determines the &quot; average &quot; person each day .
Cardi@@ ac , an app for Apple Watch , followed by 35,000 users , divided the Washington Post recently , that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of people followed , who j@@ ump@@ ed every day 30 minutes , from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company doesn &apos;t know what Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it looks just the raw information about the performance increase .
many public awareness campaigns to health , people want to bring &quot; 30 minutes to &quot; , &quot; from the sofa &quot; and &quot; every day to his &quot; st@@ ew@@ ard ears , because many public messages are bor@@ ing in health and will look like people who look like .
nevertheless , the significance of sport can not be over@@ rated .
those regularly drives sports , reduces its chances to get to cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of advantages , which is too long to lead them here .
but the wonderful to Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that there are people doing something in the open , that you have fun .
thus , three pillars of health are covered , fresh air and sun@@ shine as well as fun .
some people close on hunting even new friends .
as always , there is also m@@ onal gam@@ ers who must always compl@@ ain about something .
and yes , someone might run against a door .
what should it be ?
it has a breakthrough .
even if smartphone apps had already been able to follow @ Fit@@ bit earlier , they gave us no reason to play sport like this game .
the New will lose his maturity and the use will be returned with time .
however , because of Pok@@ em@@ ons success , there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with the activity in the real world and will help many people in the hunt , active , re@@ ap@@ ers and heal@@ th@@ ier .

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in Dam@@ ent@@ ur@@ nen
forget the pressure .
forget the h@@ ype .
Simone Bil@@ es is on all that imm@@ un .
dynamic on the trampoline .
effortlessly on the beam .
stunning on the ground .
in full line brilliant .
and now the Olympic champion now .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American Tur@@ ner@@ in er@@ kl@@ om@@ m on Thursday to the majority and extended the gap between themselves and the rest of the world before all eyes under the head@@ light of the Olympic Games .
their overall score of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly seen in front of the Silver med@@ alli@@ sts and &quot; Final Five &quot; team @-@ team @-@ mate A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal in Ali@@ ya Pat@@ af@@ ina .
the Americans , Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ bul@@ ated on the Swedish bal@@ es during the solo traveler of women at the Olympic Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ osexual American , who wins a competition win and is a total of the fifth , while it is committed to their reputation , the best of its generation or even ever .
it broke out in tears , when their final result was shown and her long journey took place at this moment .
this success puts them in the same League as unique athletes like Michael Ph@@ el@@ ps which brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es dominated the last three years of its kind of sport , 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold medals and precision , that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary L@@ ou Ret@@ ton of her said that she has ever seen &quot; the best gymn@@ ast in which I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
it was expected her last examination in Brazil , a contest , which was not so very between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather , between their and a load over@@ sized expectations .
not to return with a hand@@ ful gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be considered dis@@ appointment .
the Americans , Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man will emb@@ race himself , after they have won gold and silver in the solo traveler of women in the art project in Rio de Janeiro 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es took the first medal at Tuesday , while holding the first party on the f@@ arewell celebration of the team coordinator , Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi served as an ex@@ clamation mark .
even though it insi@@ sted on top , during their long way@@ mark on top , never have planned the future , this is not really true .
part of its soil exercises - which contain their typical Tum@@ ble Pass - is located on Latin American music , which would fit home at the street outside the Olympi@@ a@@ arena in Rio .
this is not a co@@ incidence .
this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a little child and was discovered by train@@ ee A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother during a school @-@ trip to the gym , in the Bo@@ or@@ man trained , was designed for force .
she has lost no majority competition since the summer of 2013 , a winning stre@@ ak , which will keep as long as it wishes .
even when Must@@ af@@ ina led light by two fil@@ ings , the picture was dec@@ eit@@ ed .
floating beams and Bo@@ dent@@ ur@@ nen - in which Bil@@ es keeps the world championship title - lau@@ dry .
she returned again with 15,@@ 433 on the floating bal@@ es again - and set it on the ground with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 .
Ra@@ is@@ man armed it gently when she expected her grand@@ daughter - a pure formal@@ ity - and tears flow@@ ed on Bil@@ es shiny red , white and blue p@@ yel@@ iner when the vision which she once described it in their collective book , to reality .
the performance Ra@@ is@@ mans was a ven@@ geance for the last time four years ago , when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke went to Must@@ af@@ ina .
this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team capit@@ alists , which is called &quot; O@@ ma &quot; by Americans , had a lead .
after their ground@@ breaking , she threw herself to the public cr@@ us@@ ation , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback that sometimes appears .
what it affects , so the 19 @-@ year @-@ old has a very new meaning for the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims in standard mur@@ der@@ ers shot at the car in the car
according to police report , which were published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl were killed , who died in one of the dead@@ liest attacks since one decade in the first serial mur@@ der@@ fall of Phoenix , while they were dis@@ rup@@ ted and listening in the car .
Angela Rochelle Liner , Stef@@ anie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12th while the car was par@@ ked by the car , the authorities said .
the perpet@@ rator eight shots from a hand weapon , while it stood on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle , is in the report .
the police shared that the triple murder did not seem to be the result of a prey that seems , as the attack@@ ers did not bring the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , who took possession of one of the adult victims .
the pol@@ ze@@ al pre@@ cher by Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting of the investig@@ ator led the investig@@ ator to be connected to a closer look , whether they are connected to four previous attacks .
in total , predominantly in h@@ is@@ pan@@ ic residential buildings were killed in nine months of attacks against seven people and two more injured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Howard der K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month with . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is believed that the susp@@ ects has used several vehicles including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to have the evidence of off@@ ences that they have been associated with the conclusion that the attacks have been committed and committed by the same mur@@ der@@ ers .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized because of its injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died still on site .
a witness divided the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities have also published a police report about the shooting , which took up an empty pickup truck , half an hour before the triple murder and assumed that it was the work of the serial mur@@ derer .
investigations found Pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ sen and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ sc@@ oring : &quot; it is better &quot;
like most of the 6 @-@ year old Edmund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves the singing , toys and of course his mother .
but like the least of its aging , Edmund Micro@@ zep@@ hal@@ ie , the result of a genetic disorder , which knew not his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to during their pregnancy .
when he came home the first time , my first thought , I create that .
I will not make this .
I did not let me go .
what does not mean at all -- of course one has left on it , &quot; she said .
your husband Vincent and her husband was informed that Edmund can never know them under any circumstances that he may not survive even once .
some doctors even went so far to beat him to the institutions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my first answer to it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t know that the people still do , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Edmund can run with help to help .
Edmund could neither sit up to his third year or still cra@@ w@@ ling or still cannot speak .
but he makes slow progress .
it can run with support and cycling .
he also loves to play with his two brothers and sing .
Elizabeth shows the character language that Edmund for &quot; Please sing something before &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we give him a character language that &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News .
but there is no typical character language -- says it . Edmund has invented some characters alone .
Micro@@ zep@@ hal@@ ie has a variety of causes : genetic as with Edmund as well as infections with viruses as mas@@ ons or the Z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus during pregnancy .
symptoms and forecasts may vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of the Z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to reminds of the emotional price of a certain future .
I asked , what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and it still doesn &apos;t know .
I &apos;ve never been asked more after the progn@@ osis , because I don &apos;t expect it really can say to me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has hop@@ eful advice for mothers of infants with birth damage caused by the Z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus .
it is better .
they know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
severe rainfall , flood event on rescue , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi ,
severe rainfall and large floo@@ ding in Louis@@ iana forced the Govern@@ or to call on Friday the emergency . it will be reck@@ oned with more rain every Saturday .
numerous rivers in the southeast of Louis@@ ian@@ as and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ pp@@ is floo@@ ded their banks and threatened with large @-@ scale floo@@ ding in extreme poverty .
the governor of Louis@@ iana John Bel Edwards divided that state officials were in constant contact with local authorities and have already been on the way to the congregations affected by local authorities .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ person for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Prepar@@ edness of the Govern@@ ors , shared that the en@@ quiries for flood vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags are multiplied .
Ste@@ ele said that the church was requested by Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa ten thousand sand@@ bags .
a flood warning system is used over long parts in the south Louis@@ ian@@ as until Saturday .
the weather service has abandoned that additional 3 to 5 inches may fall to rain in this area .
on Friday , a Fl@@ ut@@ n@@ war@@ n@@ system was deployed on Friday , while Mobile continued in the area Mobile .
the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near D@@ enh@@ am Springs , which are both in Louis@@ iana , will reach all probability after the weekend level .
the Met@@ ere@@ ologist Ale@@ k Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers could floo@@ ded many houses in the suburbs near Bat@@ on Rouge .
he also said that a flow down@@ ward floo@@ ding in A@@ scen@@ sion Par@@ ish represents a danger because these rivers will flow slowly into the Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as .
the river , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi border border in Liverpool , Louis@@ iana , reached on Friday at 09.00 at the highest level which was ever recorded .
rescue teams still have people from the floods in the district of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ k@@ inson in the South@@ west of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
L@@ ero@@ y H@@ ans@@ ford , his wife and his boots were among those who were saved near Glo@@ ster on Friday .
H@@ ans@@ ford , 62 , says that water by Be@@ aver Creek , which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house , is strongly increased .
he said that another step@@ son who lives in the vicinity is war@@ ned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are eight and the water flow@@ ed and flow@@ ed in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ ans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my wa@@ ist .
his wife said H@@ ans@@ ford that she lived in the 48 years in which she lived there , never had such a portrait of the river .
H@@ ans@@ ford said that he and his family members had allowed all the disabilities and it would be the only one who can swim .
H@@ ans@@ ford said that No@@ thel@@ fer had saved all three in a large military @-@ truck and had brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommodated here until Friday .
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the flood had quickly spread rapidly , since there were still heavy rain accidents , and that the authorities evacu@@ ate evacu@@ ation assign@@ ments in prayer .
according to Kr@@ aut@@ mann , a ob@@ servers close to Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain .
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the ground has been fully accomplished by the rain since Wednesday .
the authorities stated that heavy rainfall and roads floo@@ ding the rescue of inhabitants of their houses in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and teaching in five school districts .
the C@@ BS @-@ subsidiary of WW@@ L reported that a sub@@ ordin@@ ate in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa 200 floo@@ ded houses .
the residents were evacu@@ ated in two churches , which have been floo@@ ded both .
the ruler of the Municipality Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities were saved 72 people and seven pets were saved , which were r@@ ins@@ ed by floods .
in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were arranged to accommodate the evacu@@ ated evacu@@ ation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as the water begin to go back , they will return to their houses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the town of Ham@@ mond the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa were closed almost two dozens of roads due to the floo@@ ding and sand@@ bags for the residents that hope to keep the water from their houses and stores .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last great flood which we had , was in March , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ scape &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this seems to become a similar incident .
in Miss@@ issi@@ pp , Ru@@ pert L@@ acy &apos;s Emer@@ gency manager said that it continues to rule on the Gulf Coast .
according to his information , a hand@@ ful of homes should be reported to be floo@@ ded on Thursday , but on Friday there were not yet reported .
K@@ eit@@ h Town@@ son , Manager at shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; I have seen water in places where I &apos;ve never seen it before , &quot; said Town@@ son , &quot; and it still exists . &quot;
Mah@@ aj Brown , 6 , &quot; Out of spher@@ es , &quot; survi@@ ves in Philadelphia
the police divi@@ des that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already had a 6 @-@ year @-@ old child .
the grand@@ parents of the boys identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Mah@@ aj Brown .
the grand@@ parents said that Brown suffered several sh@@ utter injury , including in the L@@ ende , B@@ one , arm and belly , but that he was with his transport in hospital at consciousness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has made much easier , his little body was cut off from balls , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his grand@@ mother Del@@ ores Mel@@ en@@ dez divided the transmitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can &apos;t believe that .
the condition of the boys was classified in a hospital as a critical and he had to under@@ go several operations .
the family of the boys divided the transmitter , that it is expected to be once again .
he had to start the first class in a local primary school .
Brown was one of four people shot at German@@ town .
three men were also attached : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are according to C@@ BS Philadelphia in a stable state .
the boy was found on the front seat of a car along with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who is located in a critical condition , reported on the transmitter .
the other two victims were not found in the car and the police just determined whether there could be under one of the last males of the perpet@@ rator .
investig@@ ator part@@ ed C@@ BS Philadelphia with that it seems to be a cross @-@ fire between several sho@@ ot@@ ers .
Pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ sen for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which were tra@@ ced back to different storm @-@ guns , survived the facts .
it seems that it is definitely tra@@ ded for a continuous struggle .
on the street , on both sides of the track , H@@ ül@@ sen found themselves .
it seems that several armed fighters have been given here to have been actively involved in the police officer Anthony G@@ in@@ al@@ di of the Police in Philadelphia .
there were also several houses and vehicles in the area .
there came to no arrest and the police check the surveillance video at present , according to the surveillance video .
on Tuesday , another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a Quer@@ cy on the arm , when she played in front of her house in the West Oak Lane neighborhood .
she recovered and the police search for a susp@@ ects .
why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I present myself under the women &apos;s premi@@ ère in the tower and that consists of more than a reason .
first I &apos;ve been with each Summer Olympics in 1984 and the US had never been so dominant .
and second : this team has three Tur@@ ner@@ ve , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspir@@ ing many young girls of other skin colour .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew is and Madison Ko@@ cian , the Cath@@ o@@ kin is , round , makes everyone proud .
this crew finally reflects the US .
it has the black and h@@ is@@ pan@@ ic female presence at the top of this sport art .
in the last four years , number one was one of the female gymn@@ asts .
last year , Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
this shows strength .
during the last Olympic Games Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympi@@ ad in America .
now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world champion Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas , and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez to be like it was unexpected , but master@@ ful Gy@@ ma@@ stic rout@@ ines .
on Thursday , Simone the fourth , h@@ eter@@ osexual American , who won gold medal for women with an individual competition event .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we experience the tip of this sport , but the turn@@ around classes do not see all the country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie fought all the same way as A@@ ly and Madison , to create the Olympic team .
they are the &quot; Last Five , &quot; because the next Olympic Games is only four Tur@@ ner@@ ve in the team . Moreover , this is the last year with Marta Kar@@ ol@@ yi as trainer .
but the reality looks like that Tur@@ ns is a more expensive sport , and Turner at first line in private gym , who will count on their training , setting , travel , clothing , competition and hotel costs ( for the coach and their Turner and families ) .
the majority of these turn@@ around lie in we@@ al@@ thy suburbs , which can support the business .
in these clubs , Turner received their total training , and this is a expensive and long @-@ term commitment .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have trained both their athletes , since they started with the tower since .
we must insp@@ ire the municipalities Au@@ n countless , young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a powerful and easy access turn@@ able .
I founded my gymn@@ ast Foundation of 20 years .
for my events , we have free and affordable Tur@@ ns in Harlem for over 15,000 students ( mainly black and h@@ is@@ pan@@ ic ) , and national and international vic@@ t@@ orious winners .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer high @-@ quality exercises that make the opportunity to learn of this great Olympic sports art .
turbo@@ chargers develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and destination for the spirit .
this combination offers vital benefits for health , as well as for school and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that bring thousands of young girls to be interested in the tower and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls .
this is an exciting time .
thank you Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Madison for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ es of the Olympic Team Con@@ gol@@ ds and thank you to start a lot of young girls with different background to start healthy , strong and successful young women .

&quot; Jeremy Hunt must act now to raise the lift up and speak the concerns of the assistance of the assistance . &quot;

the BM@@ A wants to be a better week@@ day re@@ mun@@ eration for the 54@@ .000 assist@@ ants that are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director General of N@@ HS , asked the assistant to termin@@ ate the strike .
Mor@@ cars said : &quot; labour measures are not just a little , but already loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patients , nurs@@ ing and their families only wor@@ ries , emergency and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
in the last two months , we talked to the committee of the assistance of Assi@@ stance and with the Ministry of Health as well as other minist@@ ries a positive regard to the concerns of Vor@@ m@@ und@@ ance and W@@ hist@@ leb@@ low@@ ings .

culture of Political Cor@@ ect@@ ness , elec@@ toral campaign in Muslim areas
the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was founded last year on the release of a government report for corruption from the office
a culture of the Political Cor@@ ect@@ ness has led to this widespread vot@@ al election in Muslim congregations will be igno@@ red like a devastating governmental report today .
the former Cab@@ inet member Sir Eric Pic@@ kl@@ es compl@@ ying the police , election observation , and Rath@@ geber to ignore evidence of &quot; su@@ pers@@ ens@@ ity relating to Eth@@ nie and Religion . &quot;
the former Minister for Integration and Municipal Government , which is now a Ant@@ al rup@@ ting oil , said that the duty of voters should be allowed to establish the police outside of elec@@ oms in order to protect def@@ aul@@ ted elec@@ tors in order to protect voters .
he recommends that voters should lead a reference to prove their identity in the elections .
at the moment a voters must call his name and address .
the report suggests , not leng@@ thy ink on the finger of a person when they give their elec@@ toral voice to prevent someone cho@@ oses twice .
W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower should receive greater protection , says Sir Eric .
it demands that the press should have more access to the community documents and decisions of non @-@ official regulations or work@@ groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not only for election , but also the municipal government is to protect against the bro@@ ader corruption and financial capit@@ ul@@ ture that goes away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by the Dow@@ ning Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets in the east of London .
last year , a special appeal lodged that the Mayor Mayor Lut@@ on Rah@@ man had to become a Lit@@ an@@ ei on corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry .
the court found that Rah@@ man had suspected the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; on z@@ yn@@ ical way , &quot; and that he had brought his critics with rac@@ ism and Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bi@@ en@@ an@@ cies to silence .
Rah@@ man should have led his campaign on the basis , that it was the cor@@ on@@ ous duty of Muslims to choose Him . &quot;
up to 300 voices were either dou@@ bt@@ edly or a follow @-@ up , with which one person cho@@ oses another .
Sir Eric said that it was the evidence of the country &apos;s evidence .
in particular , he expressed himself al@@ ar@@ ming from the fr@@ au@@ dul@@ ent letter election - at the older members of the Muslim community to people , to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pictured here , made several recommendations to clean the elec@@ toral system , including the Leadership of evidence to prove the identity
in his report it says : &quot; as proof was appropriate that pressure on protection needs of some ethnic min@@ orities was exercised , in particular women and young people in order to choose the elderly , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ic or ban@@ ished background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was concerns that ... state institutions such that such behaviour were ignor@@ ance due to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; polit@@ ically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerns about eth@@ never and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the ban that political activists documents &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to stop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; election . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report that is drawn by Ther@@ esa May in nar@@ ration , also demands har@@ der registration tests to prevent the elec@@ toral level of immig@@ ration and social security purposes .
options to be considered to ask elec@@ tor prior to your selection after your identification .
not leng@@ thy ink on the finger of a person when she has released their voice to prevent someone cho@@ oses twice .
systematic review on the nationality of a person to ensure that they are voting right .
a three @-@ year limitation to applications on automatic mail selection .
prohibition to process political activists in the elections and envelop@@ es of mail orders .
in order to establish the police , leave the police to set up comp@@ resses .
a change of legislation which caused an acc@@ us@@ ation for en@@ forcement in accordance with the repres@@ sions of the People Act 1983 ( Economics Law 1983 ) facilit@@ ates .
photographer banned in elec@@ toral stations .
requirement that only English will be used in the elec@@ toral stations ( except for Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training , to ensure that the employees are usually going through that elec@@ tors are alone in the elec@@ toral cabin .
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets case no penalty was placed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the elec@@ toral court has Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy , based on a Lit@@ an@@ ei on corrupt and illegal practices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to a number of reasons , it was found guilty due to the high requirements in the criminal proceedings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he critic@@ ises the effective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ab@@ h@@ ak@@ af@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of voting rights departments of the Rath@@ geber . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric said : &quot; the Jud@@ gment in Tower Ham@@ lets of the last year was a warning signal .
our country is wearing a proud legacy as the mother of par@@ liam@@ ents , but the spread of sel@@ dom and conce@@ aled spreading of some authorities and thre@@ aten this good reputation .

the h@@ unters and the Wolf : team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , has been compared to Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o since his childhood
apart from the K@@ ates double @-@ singer on the bicycle run@@ way , many people on the internet are going to be on the Internet as a certain arch@@ ers of Di@@ d@@ ym@@ us from a @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o .
the team member of the U.S. team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a ons@@ lau@@ ght on Twitter after pictures , on which he looks similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star secretly .
in fact , the arch@@ ers got the mad@@ ness to the social media and gave it to him that he has already been trying to hear in his childhood he looks like Leo .
&quot; I do not see great simil@@ arity , except the fac@@ ial hair@@ y , &quot; Bra@@ dy the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post with .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a little sigh@@ ted guy , so I do this as a compli@@ ments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will und@@ ou@@ bt@@ edly occur more into the center : the simil@@ arity between British forces Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris .

one ais@@ le higher : this user is the view that Nathan is the &quot; athlet@@ ic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption Schauspiel@@ ers
another continued comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h hard kind , which has similar severe ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medal s@@ wimm@@ ers Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ f@@ im@@ ova has more than just the sun be@@ av@@ ed skin and bl@@ on@@ den hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ al@@ yn@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while Americans became Adrian of fans , an athlet@@ ic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar fac@@ ial shape and eyes
not the only thing : a Twitter user was very happy about that others like the simil@@ ar@@ ities too .
there are theory in space : according to this user , there may be a reason for the simil@@ arity of the Pa@@ ares maybe a reason .
a Twitter U@@ ser@@ in declared its satisfaction that &quot; the rest of the internet think that Hope and J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot;
in fact , the US football star hope solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter an incredibly similar visual form and eyes .

the network also stopped quickly and gave a message to a message .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we regre@@ t it correctly that these statements were made and that it was possible that they will be broadcast@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we spent yesterday night quickly with our spectators at the broadcast and our followers in the social media .
in order to clari@@ fy one , Byr@@ ons are based on the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not to them as a person .
nevertheless they were in@@ adequ@@ ately and an un@@ happy chosen formulation . Byron pract@@ ises what he said , very sorry .
on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ Donald was in the shipment and tried his re@@ mark to justi@@ fy his re@@ mark , saying that it was not his intention to make it as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to accept me for the comment which I made after the women &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ BC Olympic Club &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have moved to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not to them as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course there was no mis@@ cont@@ emp@@ t , and I &apos;m sorry for me . &quot;
buyers in Pri@@ mark stamps about woman who tast@@ ed in the middle of the business
the buyer did not know where they should see when a woman moved their clothes in the midst of a pri@@ mark to try sub @-@ p@@ ants .
to im@@ wor@@ ms the situation , they numbered , as she saw in it , she went out and put back into the shelf .
they continued and tried four pairs of under@@ p@@ ants in a store at Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Mall in Folk@@ estone .
the Pri@@ mark Store at Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , in which the woman tried the under@@ p@@ ants before going back into the shelf
a mother of two children , J@@ enny David@@ son , who had been at the same time in the business , said that after the mysterious woman had tast@@ ed the under@@ wear , she went back again and the business left without buying . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people could not believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
standing in the middle of the sales area , they took a pair of under@@ p@@ ants from the out@@ lay , moved their own stock@@ pil@@ es and p@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t want to find a somewhat discre@@ et place to do it - it was simply there , fre@@ ch as Oskar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each star@@ red when they returned the under@@ p@@ ants that you didn &apos;t like it , since they put back into the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same with three other sub@@ p@@ ants before it finally decided that you had nothing right and went down again .
&quot; it seemed not to distur@@ b it , that they observed someone , or think about the person who would buy them under circumstances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. David@@ son , 33 who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how do you think any under@@ p@@ ants would take home to the house , who had any other person , and had not been washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; woman David@@ son added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I have seen , the employees tried to draw the garments from the sale after she went - what exactly is good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate it , with a new couple of h@@ ants to go home and find out that another woman had her and went out and did not get washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a speaker of Pri@@ mark said : &quot; Pri@@ mark is the case that occurred on Tuesday August 9 in our branch in Folk@@ stone , deliber@@ ately . &quot;
all products in question were drawn from the sale .
how to protect with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a against arms against arms
the world outside is a dangerous location , but this video of D@@ ail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com might make it something safe for you .
we talked with Rh@@ on Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to walk with armed rob@@ bers on the distance .
regardless of whether you approach from the front or behind , this video will show you how to turn your sk@@ ewer for your rob@@ bers .
if you att@@ aching to you from behind , then you should see as the first to see , so that you can see your attack@@ ers , &quot; says Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi . &quot;
take the weapon between your fore@@ arm and your shoulder before you beat it with your free el@@ bow .
beat him with the kne@@ e in the k@@ ste and turn it , while the attack@@ er came together with pain , the weapon from his hands . beat him with the run into the face and move on , while they move the weapon on him .
with attack@@ ers , the technique is similar - move your body from the line , take the weapon and turn it so that the attack@@ ers can &apos;t shoot .
at the same time , they control the weight on the weapon and beat the attack@@ ers on the chest , then turn the weapon from its handle before moving forward and the weapon on him .
sounds difficult ?
check out the video to see exactly how it makes Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that there is a prey on the saf@@ est , your money is sufficient - if you have no Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master .
travelling Ian Wright for a guide of his tongue to the most beautiful places of Europe
a British Reis@@ er sub@@ du@@ ed his immune system and dig@@ nity of a serious review by taking some of the most dirty and most beautiful places of Europe .
the moder@@ ator and it@@ aut@@ or Ian Wright , 51 , from Suff@@ olk will set his wake up on a Euro bill , a hin@@ ge at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a pur@@ ge knob of a pulling toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance of its immune system .
before the emp@@ ower of each object , he used a L@@ umin@@ ometer to show himself and to show us what he is going to leave .
but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength &quot; brought some surprising results in daylight .
the thought to hide the fl@@ ashing pot of a pulling toilet , which has already been used by thousands of others , it really can be im@@ per@@ vious to be found in a kitchen molecules more bad bacteria .
on his journey through Europe , Mr. Wright with doctors and medical professionals spoke about the promotion of gut bacteria and its own health .
lu@@ ck@@ ily , did not leave what he put off , more than a bad re@@ taste in the mouth .
Mr. Wright has been known to test the resistance of its gut by playing the world through the world , as well as wonderful things .
of public funds to train stations up to dish@@ on@@ tur@@ ers of toilets , the task presented its immune system definitely under one sample
in the film he told : &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned , what my health concerns , and I have put all possible things in my mouth , Earth , wor@@ ms and sl@@ ud@@ ge . &quot;
in the movie he was justified to his call .
the only thing that he refused , was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
its propor@@ tions showed a lumin@@ ance of more than 4000 units .
compared with this , the L@@ umin@@ omet@@ ry number is fresh washed hands less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet , which he refused to refuse , after her L@@ umin@@ omet@@ rics has over 4000 units , while fresh@@ ly washed hands have a height of less than 60 .
Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products vali@@ dated the travel film &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom
in the film he says : &quot; this comes to the worst , which I have rounded up in a toilet , close . &quot;
there is nothing dirt more than that !
I will spare here for nothing because it is inside the box here .
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products .
the company uses Mr. Wright with Vali@@ o Ge@@ fil@@ us , which contains both l@@ actic acid bacteria , as well as vitamin C and D , to support the support of gut bacteria and immune system .
vali@@ dates Senior Venice President for snacks , ju@@ ices and new categories N@@ iko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted to offer the consumer people really something new .
something that is fascinating for watching and at the same time the advantages of Pro@@ biotics &quot; explains .
we led the crazy Bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings , which led to us that we said &quot; Let &apos;s call us Ian . &quot;
they claim that interest in health health is becoming a global phenomenon
instead of just over the products we wanted to present them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of the intest@@ inal health and how it is associated with the immune system .
the growing interest in the intest@@ inal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide more information on an interesting way .
I think that the film shows that we have a great sense of hum@@ or !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the direc@@ ting of the film , said : &quot; let me lose my respect for Ian , if he had tast@@ ed some of the things I &apos;ve been tried to empty the Russian toilet , which is shown in the film . &quot;
of course there were things where it was easier to bring Ian , they h@@ edges and others , with which this was quite difficult .
I &apos;m glad we have recorded some of these dirty les@@ ions on film . &quot;
in a survey carried out by the survey carried out by 2015 , 84 per cent of all respon@@ dents in Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ illi , especially with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said that they contain at least occasionally products that added Mil@@ or@@ ish bacteria .
A@@ social family destro@@ ys social apartment in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
an genocide family left her social apartment after a delay of £ 50,000 , because it had terr@@ orized her neighbours .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from her estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after some of them were removed from their property , sho@@ cked employees of the housing estate , owned by an ir@@ repaired state .
the walls were cl@@ amped holes , wooden di@@ ps were torn , rub@@ b@@ ish has been scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubric@@ ated to walls .
the family moved around and it is believed that she now lives in a private accommodation
Donn@@ a Mc@@ Ev@@ o@@ y , who works for the house administration at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that she was not able to repair the apartment no more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare here and I am the view that people must not live in this way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to take into consideration since this property is probably considered as a beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is inf@@ am@@ ous and her call is it .
the pair had three sons , who lived in the apartment , and the police said that the terror had done the family , street strug@@ gles with bases , in@@ timi@@ date of people , drug abuse , drug tra@@ ff@@ icking , drug tra@@ ff@@ icking , drugs and flu@@ kes .
sk@@ el@@ eton , 47 , whose name was on the lease agreement , in June , a arrangement of ant@@ iso@@ pro@@ cal behavior came in June .
in some rooms of the house which will be demolished under circumstances , old gar@@ bage was found .
these were tra@@ ded in the estate where drugs have been tra@@ ded in the past drugs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ eigh@@ bours told them that they saw them on the streets , and regularly called the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ etes and her partner of this week were for@@ ci@@ ble at the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to attract voluntarily .
the Del@@ og@@ ation were che@@ ered by ligh@@ ten neighbours , who said that their lives was made to hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were ashamed of her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived for 20 years next to them and it was always bad .
the countless times that we say the police are incredible .
&quot; tomorrow we couldn &apos;t sleep . &quot;
we stood there , because it was so quiet - that &apos;s not usual !
now , where they are finally gone , it will be beautiful .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it would have a family to co@@ operate with local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police was called regular intervals for 20 years .
rub@@ b@@ ish and old toys were cast down on the over@@ laid side of the joint house .
he added : &quot; it is a dis@@ grace that it was the ten@@ ant to accept any responsibility for her behaviour and the family , since a delay is always the last step , the Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing is considered .
that was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extremely difficult and had to watch their deeds for their neighbours .
I guess all the work that my team , the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the community that have cour@@ age@@ ous to us and have given us the information .
I hope that these development will don@@ ate some neigh@@ bors and the message gives you that ant@@ iso@@ ara behavior is not toler@@ ated .
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three children were lived at different times in the house , but they all may be over 20 .
a dirty mattress included in one of the bedroom of the house after del@@ og@@ ation on the ground
workers of the house administration are now to w@@ asted tr@@ ash@@ ort that the house is surrounded by
in 2014 , police conducted a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g cannabis as well as orph@@ ans , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ es and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
sk@@ el@@ eton received a fine penalty after it pleaded guilty to the owner of a threat of class B in Handels@@ abor@@ tions .
it claimed that the money was a gra@@ vest@@ one of her son Lee Skel@@ don who came with a car accident in 2013 .
after they were without Ob@@ ach , it is assumed that T@@ anya and her partner is now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth .
many rooms of the house were sc@@ aled with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police says that it is po@@ eter del@@ og@@ gle that do not keep in the order .
Angela C@@ row divided by the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall that Del@@ og@@ ation is a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants that do not keep in the order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think they can do without deduc@@ ting them , as well as to those who were buried with such behavior , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Devon and Corn@@ wall Police will never toler@@ ate criminal and ant@@ iso@@ rative behaviour that continue to work with partners to protect our municipalities .

Olympia : Dre@@ ister T@@ am with D@@ oping test
the IOC intends to judge a discipline commission .
Ken@@ ji athletes threatened after the second d@@ oping aff@@ air during the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Games .
after an attempt at a d@@ oping control of a d@@ oping control in the Olympic Village , Kenya sent a coach to her home .
the International Olympic Committee divided into order to establish a discipline Commission to examine the case .
a ken@@ nel function had informed that the former Sprinter and today coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , in the Olympic Village a ur@@ ine sample under the name of the 800 @-@ metre @-@ L@@ eller F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i .
this is the team deri@@ vation of Kenya from D@@ oping control .
the world association IA@@ AF has chosen the IOC for information about the case to rig@@ orous their own investigations into a IA@@ AF speaker .
&quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures of the IOC the IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; called it in a IA@@ AF statement .
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) has gone to the D@@ oping control station and has spent himself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i , the rehear@@ sal and signed , &quot; declared Ken@@ ji Chef de mission Stephan ar@@ ap So@@ i .
he was in possession of the ac@@ creditation of athletes who stood on the list for training controls of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i was in 2015 in Beijing World Cup four over 800 meters .
four days ago , the Ken@@ yan Athlet@@ ics Leader Michael Rot@@ i had been deduc@@ ted from the Rio games .
he is supposed to be informed of cash payments by his country on the standing d@@ oping test .
according to media reports , he was to be arrested at his return at the airport of Nairobi .
Kenya has already been taking part in the IOC in particular at the IOC for longer time under special observation .
in the announcement of the IOC out of the IOC out more than 2000 D@@ oping control centres in front of the Rio Olympics , it was previously pointed out that particularly athletes from Kenya and Russia must be taken into the vis@@ or .
the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency had exercised a lot of pressure on the African country in Brazil , an anti @-@ d@@ oping law and a functional control system .
the law was passed a few weeks before the Olympic era .
in a row , WA@@ DA Kenya participated in the list of countries whose d@@ oping control is compliant with the WA@@ DA rules .
Kenya is considered a big runner @-@ up .
the athletes of the country won most medals in Beijing in 2015 .
in a series of TV report the ARD have always been informed again that D@@ oping resources are easily accessible and there is a significant ment@@ ality of the sports bet@@ ru@@ gs .
IOC Member of Richard Po@@ und asked for a similar investigation in Kenya as he had asked them in the Russian female athlet@@ ics .
it could be proven that this sports art area was covering and systematically was systematically controlled .
Russian athl@@ ets were then excluded from the summer .
Salzburg &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli
in the Shakespeare @-@ Year , the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Mary as a portable lovers , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et .
with a surprising Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli .
one musical conqu@@ ers in Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ one masterpiece .
the artistic director of Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of the classic and met with the role of Mary a youth room .
in the orchestra , the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var orchestra excav@@ ated under the direction of the Venezu@@ elan conductor Gust@@ av@@ o D@@ ud@@ amel : &quot; this music is full of rhythm . &quot;
we always say that they are very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their pace and their mel@@ ody .
it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have Bern@@ st@@ one music really in our blood !
in this st@@ aging , Bart@@ oli plays an older Mary .
she rec@@ alls with clay to her lovers with Tony , while the younger Mary plays and dance .
the role of Mary has always fascin@@ ated me .
first , because it is musi@@ cally exceedingly !
and then it would be Mari@@ as Personal@@ ity .
she says it in her song : &quot; I am Pre@@ t@@ ty , oh so Pre@@ t@@ ty , I &quot; Pre@@ t@@ ty and wit@@ ty and B@@ right . &quot;
it is therefore smart , of course also n@@ ai@@ v , and very passionate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they resem@@ bles me much , my Italian character , which I used as Rö@@ mer@@ in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laugh@@ s Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ ud@@ amel is a wonderful artist for the Opera House : &quot; Cec@@ ilia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such a honor for us to work with her .
she is an unexpected man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Bart@@ oli gives the compli@@ ments back : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ud@@ amel is an extraordinary artist and passionate ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
one sees it in every of his movements , in his eyes , it is his life !
it is so a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a che@@ er@@ ful approach to life , that &apos;s very important at all !
&quot; &quot; &quot; Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this piece it comes to advantages and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today we have passed the refugees , at that time the Pu@@ ert@@ ori@@ ans went to New York , and the New York inhabitants wanted it not .
they are the same topics , and they are the same as the same as then .
59 years later , the piece is still relevant .
London School school , which joined the IS in Syria , was killed in Syria
K@@ adi@@ za Sult@@ ana , one of three British school@@ girls left the last year in London to join the IS , report@@ edly died in Syria .
the advoc@@ ate Tas@@ n@@ ime Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said that her family learned from her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria some weeks ago .

Sult@@ ana was 17 years old and died after their family shortly after she had prepared the war to leave the war and return to England .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one can only hope that the only good is in it - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated to go into a war zone - people who think ever to make this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in February 2015 , Sult@@ ana and two other young girls from the East London rose to a plane towards Turkey and then take a bus to the Syrian border .
Sult@@ anas family has been told that she married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria - and within a few months a widow .

Turkey : Kur@@ dish church calcul@@ ates with mass curse
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who doesn &apos;t fit and Erd@@ og@@ an , sits on packed knives , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Presidency of the Gü@@ len &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dialogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Kur@@ dish congregation of Germany expects a short term of tens of thousands of protection that are vol@@ at@@ ened from Turkey to Germany in short term .
in the medium term , it could even be &quot; some hundred thousand , &quot; believeth on the presi@@ ding Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes .
because of the hard approach of Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erd@@ og@@ an , after the coup attempt , the Kur@@ dish congregation of Germany expected a mass flight to Germany .
at short term , I have ten thousands of thousands , medium term , with some hundred thousand protective seek@@ ers from Turkey in Germany , when the Erd@@ og@@ an regime continued to continue the min@@ orities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the band presi@@ ding Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; World &quot; of Friday .
because the government had already passed the Kur@@ dish high @-@ bur@@ dens in the months of Kur@@ bur@@ dens , 500,000 Kur@@ ds within Turkey had to flee .
after the failed coup , still se@@ cular and op@@ positi@@ onal ethnic Turks added .
many will continue to start in Europe if they are supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state who takes himself refugees in his own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chief of Staff approved the targeted settlement of Syrian Arab in Kur@@ dish , but also in Algeri@@ an cities .
in order to increase the travel pressure to the remaining Kur@@ ds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last major minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks were wi@@ ped out in the last hundred years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also CDU @-@ member &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Chief of Staff demanded that the Federal Government has positioned itself as sharp as Austria against Erd@@ og@@ an and its tra@@ ilers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also in Germany a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wit@@ ch hunting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is held against Erd@@ og@@ an critics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel no longer in Germany for the first time in recent months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
more Turks are looking for asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and opposition .
the fire mark@@ er than Gü@@ len tra@@ ilers destroyed teachers and other academ@@ ics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who doesn &apos;t fit and Erd@@ og@@ an , sits on packed knives , by the way also the Kem@@ alists and saws , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , Chairman of the Gü@@ len &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dialogue and Education , &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the newspaper was reported calling at the figures of the Federal Ministry of Culture , the Turks reported the biggest group of asylum seek@@ ers in Germany before the coup .
at the reporting date June 30 , this 11.@@ 386 people and thus nearly 29 percent of all regarded as as@@ yl@@ ate has been recognized ( 3@@ 9.@@ 625 ) .
in this survey cannot find themselves before the war , poverty or pro@@ lon@@ el@@ ess@@ ness of skir@@ m@@ ness .
asylum seek@@ ers according to the Basic Law are exclusively polit@@ ically , so far from the state of government , individually persecuted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where do you do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sel@@ ts@@ ames Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the nati@@ ves get nothing of the summer election campaign with - and the holiday of North Rhine @-@ Westphalia may not choose the Parliament .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood them .
in 2021 , the Parliament election will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays , the heavy Parliament has decided at the beginning of the year .
for stup@@ id as far as to date , it is not : summer holidays , heat and land sw@@ ings - it does not matter .
the loc@@ als that are convinced by the election campaign are on holiday .
the very most beautiful holiday , which are in the countryside , on U@@ se@@ dom , Rü@@ gen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not allowed to choose the local day .
to do this , practical problems occur : in the holidays are hel@@ pers to distribute the posters , air bal@@ lo@@ ons , fl@@ yers , and count towards the end of the votes , just hit them .
until September 4 , 2016 , the vot@@ er - and last fixed day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to pass even more elections to the people over the people .
the hot phase , if one can say that at all , has just begun .
and it &apos;s also something : Prime Minister Erwin Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CDU Coalition , must be afraid of his ministry .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CDU .
thr@@ illing , how strongly Ne@@ ul@@ ing Af@@ D cuts and remains at the end of Ko@@ al@@ ition@@ ist remains .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 head of government , makes an almost un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive election campaign , one sees his grand@@ parents .
he travels across the country , distributed Ros@@ en and pl@@ au@@ ts a little with the people , such as it had already been a legend of the former Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff .
otherwise , sail@@ or has got hands @-@ old feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the gu@@ ilt on the bl@@ ossom of the Af@@ D .
their refugee policy , their &quot; We Create , &quot; I will make the rise of the pop@@ uli@@ ar lists , which is now probably the beautiful office of ministry .
the CDU with its peak data , the Minister of the Interior Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already seen how it is , if you make a false moment on the right place of election campaign .
she has been invited twice as a German Chancellor Angela Merkel . Merkel &apos;s general ground circle is located in the Nor@@ theast .
but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern .
&quot; there was probably the majority from other federal states , &quot; accused Vincent Co@@ ert , Secretary @-@ General of the CDU in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in N@@ DR .
but it &apos;s no man to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany , Angela Merkel .
otherwise the North East CDU largely has the usual election conditions on market rates and shopping m@@ alls with umbre@@ llas and air bal@@ lo@@ ons .
this , so , co@@ ca@@ ert , play only a &quot; sub@@ ordin@@ ate role . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also the Union has noted that you &apos;re on the basis the basis that you need to take care of the base to find a wire to the people again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are like the left , the SPD , the Green Party : hardly available in the arms of the country .
however , the Council of the CDU nom@@ inees Co@@ ert to his fellow soldier , &quot; You must go where it is we@@ ave , namely , where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden Wed@@ dings , every birthday party has to be used . &quot;
because much on the game , Sell@@ ering has called his SPD as a particularly dedicated election campaign .
in surveys , Socialists and Democrats last with 22 percent behind the CDU ( 25 ) and just below the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
at the election of 2011 the SPD won a clear 30.@@ 5.6 percent in front of the CDU ( 22 ) .
the gre@@ enery , small party with seven percent in surveys , may be able to create the jump into the land day .
they make a modern T@@ ug@@ h holiday home and place their election campaign in the internet .
&quot; online election campaign &quot; is the state president Claudia Müller .

B@@ 27 @-@ renovation : guest workshops suffer from locking
at the speed , with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ it@@ ated , there is nothing to eat .
for the leaders of the construction work , starting at 5.@@ 30 in the morning and only at 8 o &apos;clock , there are always praise .
&quot; they made everything quite angry , &quot; says El@@ vira T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the jet fuel station .
this is a superb team .
there is no coating .
the construction site could be re@@ located at the weekend of October to the south , until the end of October is supposed to be finished .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blessed is also the case for the construction of the persons responsible for the establishment of accommodation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the construction site opened on Monday to the South , and also the blocking of the Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen was lifted and thus re@@ lied the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg , has relaxed the traffic situation within the resort .
the citizen can now come from O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen to the B 27 again on both sides .
the soft traffic through the place seems to be back .
&quot; there were partially significant complaints , &quot; says he responsible for the rehabilitation management of the renovation of the Deputy Head of Florian King .
the residents of Bach@@ straße , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ n@@ erst@@ raße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many stro@@ kes and more their Nav@@ i trusted in the signs .
what this led to lack of trucks in residential areas .
because the speed limit should not be kept , the congregation will ampli@@ fied the knife from M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; there were considerable survi@@ vor@@ s , &quot; says King , who made herself on site about the location .
two to three times a minute have been b@@ lown up .
the quick@@ est speed was on the road with 77 hour kilometers in the temp@@ o @-@ 30 zone .
since the construction site has been continued , it has become a quiet yet .
for the business@@ men at the B 27 it is only a small comfort that is now open for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg to the street .
in the cards , business operators are not willing to look at .
but that the B 27 reconstruction has led with them to revenues breaks , everyone who asks , can look well .
however , some more and some are affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; who has less to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; final customers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; for other companies , for which the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; even during the car from Mai@@ er , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a slight decline , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but also a note that of course &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is missing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the strongest explo@@ res the local roads are on the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds distinct words .
this is already exist@@ ent .
not only him but all the hosts did it hard . &quot;
they lack@@ ed the customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ tw@@ eil .
we must be happy about every Euro turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he rose to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far more than 50 percent &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the street action took his operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has to pay half of his employees .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and the half would have been dismissed , the policy would be re@@ acted differently .
instead , government president Jörg Schmidt on a request by G@@ öh@@ ner , whether there could be a financial compensation otherwise , the guest can also prof@@ ited from the advantages of the situation at the B 27 . now , it must also be the dis@@ advantages that make up the refurb@@ ishment .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other rural districts , where a bit more generous have been handled .
in all complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue to pass .
after all , the family business has been located here since 17@@ 15 , he refers to the long history .
that other stem guests can now understand less frequently due to the complicated traffic leadership , he can understand .
if you don &apos;t drive it , it is also different .
that his tri@@ c@@ lical after the end of the renovation work again , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt .
despite the cris@@ es of BSE and bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner keeps the effects of the B 27 works to its client@@ ele for the largest crisis that has experienced his restaurant in its long @-@ standing history .
six month construction work , that &apos;s already brutal .
in the name of the terror control of the laws .
after the recent attacks , Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère now put a thick security package .
but what has a failure to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all that ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the Re@@ conc@@ iler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all of his proposals are entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; polit@@ ically for@@ ut@@ ably &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the Federal Minister for the presentation of his new security package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they request a request .
others , further points would first be discussed within the parties .
I also involved myself .
but as the Minister of Interior , it was located on results and in a &quot; re@@ cover@@ able con@@ sens@@ us &quot; within the coalition .
after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère takes a little time before being presented his conclusions for the security in the Republic .
however , the fall is to be more extensive .
some is already known , announced that a new security authority to take care of the b@@ aked communication is not new .
also , not the fact that Germany must implement multiple EU directives on flight data and tru@@ ce .
the call after more video surveillance and staff for security authorities is not surprising as well .
in part , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère starts a second approach for suggestions that have not yet been doing with the SPD : he wants to turn sympath@@ y for terror@@ ists under punishment and jihadists with double citizenship to the German Pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dream of the CDU man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite this , it is still working for reasonable and challenging anything , which at the co@@ incidence partner I don &apos;t have chances of chances .
a few new ideas presents de Mai@@ zi@@ ère .
they are partially in itself : it is planning a quick system for shi@@ fts and more possibilities for raising people before departure .
refugees who have to be brought into the country , should leave their smartphone &apos;s smart phones and social media accounts for a security check .
in case of several asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to do some worse than so far - about such that off@@ ences or their papers realize to swal@@ low their identity .
some of them is polit@@ ically and legally marry .
man@@ ches can also be un@@ balanced and is un@@ balanced .
and with a few points - the un@@ equal treatment of commem@@ oration , for example - is the question : what does that actually do with security and terror ?
yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the topics of refugees and terror .
but it doesn &apos;t matter to say that the terrorist attacks were Ans@@ bach and Würzburg refugees .
in addition , many people did worry about the high refugee camps .
and things that people have to deep@@ est people , let not let loose himself in election times .
the inner security is enormous in the focus .
only the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the un@@ locking is large .
and yes , there are election competitions .
the Union and SPD states increasingly in position with regard to internal safety .
in recent days , between the two parties , it passed between the two parties .
only a gar@@ n@@ ty dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then a security for a security ideas collection of some Unions of the Federal Minister , which also demand a Bur@@ ka ban and a return from the double citizenship .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère lab@@ oured in order to reconc@@ ile sounds here .
from a return of the double pass , he doesn &apos;t get nothing .
we met the discussion in Germany .
it is not reasonable if you do not need to make sense .
and at a Bur@@ ka @-@ prohibition he had a constitutional obj@@ ections .
whether his own par@@ cel is fixed on all corners , and whether it is &quot; reasonable &quot; for the co@@ axial partner , it has to show himself yet .
it &apos;s a lot of what could ensure dispute .
but the SPD currently tries to pro@@ filing an internal safety on the topic of internal safety .
Part@@ n@@ ef Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ alizes all talk time and says : &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything , to increase security further . &quot;
even Volkswagen comes through .
in spite of diesel vehicles , the supplier will rise worldwide .
but not in all markets it runs round .
with the return reaction there are tur@@ key about a term .
Volkswagen launches delivery in the second half of 2013 .
Europe &apos;s largest high@@ ways in the previous year , despite its many brands and some good @-@ running markets , despite its many brands and some good circulation markets .
but in July , the VW weak@@ ened the VW brand primarily in Western Europe and loaded the total sales , as described in the D@@ ax company .
worldwide , the VW in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars sold 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year &apos;s month .
in Western Europe alone , following China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s month .
in the home market of Germany , deliveries increased by almost a hex@@ agon .
brand new president Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weaker numbers from July , mainly in two sales days less in Europe .
in addition , in some core markets , the economic conditions called &quot; changed economic conditions . &quot;
in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote will also be charged to Australia from the EU , explained a spokes@@ man .
in the U.S. , where exhaust emissions first es@@ cal@@ ated first , is also a Min@@ us to be@@ ech .
great support for VW is the Chinese market .
overall , the primarily affected domestic brand of the Lower Saxony will continue to be limited by the Diesel@@ sk@@ and@@ al : after the first seven months , only an extra@@ dition minus from 0.9 percent to 3,@@ 37 million vehicles are available .
the Group leader of Fred Kap@@ pler could continue to introduce a sales spl@@ us from January to July .
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles in this time , around 5,@@ 904 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated with a software .
in Germany alone , VW calls approximately 2.5 million wagons to re@@ arm@@ ament to the workshops .
in the course of re@@ arm@@ ament , VW announced that the conversion of cars has no negative effects .
after upgrading the vehicles there is no deteri@@ oration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance .
the bus station to customers after re@@ arm@@ ament is a &quot; guaranteed &quot; guarantee of &quot; guarantee &quot; but did not talk about a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was called on Friday in corporate circuits .
reason for legal gu@@ ed@@ oms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reported that Volkswagen granted its German customers now a guarantee for the diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this would have been confirmed on Monday VW representatives at the Federal Office of Office .
it was confirmed by the Ministry of Transport that there was this meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has completed the requirements of my investig@@ ating Commission and the KBA complete year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; variations of these are not accepted , &quot; declared Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to the Ministry .
VW has taken the warranty that in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine output after upgrading no deteri@@ oration and all typ@@ ed vehicle values remain unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not how it was in corporate circuits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the wide term &quot; warranty &quot; Volkswagen is the possibility that customers come back for example a half year after the conversion about with a motor harm in a workshop - and this could lead to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do .
also in customer interest , it is important to avoid that it is possible to do with any other damage , which is nothing to do with the Ab@@ g@@ ass@@ k@@ and@@ al , which comes with regards to in@@ trin@@ si@@ cally warranty claims , as it was called .
therefore , VW use the term &quot; guarantee &quot; not .
Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ mund at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see is demanded by rich savings in future pen@@ alties - as a second institute in Germany .
President Josef Paul said on Thursday , &quot; It is only about 139 customers that use 40 million euros on Gi@@ ro@@ - or daily monetary policy . &quot;
the German Association of German banks speaks of a single incident and sees no signal : normal savings must not fear , to pay for their as@@ cl@@ onal pen@@ alties . &quot;
banks money over night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , you have to pay 0.4 percent penalty .
this fee requires the Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ mund from September of private and corporate clients for deposits over 100.000 euros on plaster or daily monetary policy .
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100,000 will cost 400 Euros in the year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ski@@ pped 40 million Euros that could be lifted up from one day to the other , and that he could not exist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are at the central bank account and cause 0.4 per cent of costs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Bank Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can not hin@@ ge for any one million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost is due after the caus@@ al principle now .
the cash just in the saf@@ es in the Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank would be too dangerous : &quot; I &apos;ve seen four over@@ ra@@ ids , I don &apos;t want to know the fifth ! , &quot; said the Chief Financial Officer .
most of the clients could have understanding and changes to other investment forms .
only few walking to other banks .
the cooperative federation Bayern declared : &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the ECB causes significant costs in all banks . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they alone apply , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not possible permanently permanently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account , credit cards or transfers .
with pen@@ alties from three million euros , the Thuring@@ ian People and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank Al@@ ten@@ burger country had made head@@ lines with their ski bank stores in 2014 .
Michael Kem@@ mer , chief executive director of the banking group , said : &quot; we don &apos;t expect that private customers will have to pay for deposits , with the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks much too strong . &quot;
a ban@@ ker said , at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; a client@@ ele that is equipped with a little more l@@ ush . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be a small bank for a problem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they are free money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
founded in 1911 , G@@ mund has established branches in Bad Wies@@ see , R@@ ott@@ ach @-@ E@@ noch , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .
well @-@ known actors , athletes and entrepren@@ eurs live in the region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; currently no other banks are currently known for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ operatives Association Bayern &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for deposits of private customers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said spokes@@ person Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the President of the Federal Association of the German national banks and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ strasse ( BvR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared the end of June : &quot; the threshold , into neg@@ atives , is very high , very high . &quot;
the competition is hard , and it dro@@ ves the emig@@ ration of anch@@ ors to the competition .

destination boards : who actually buy sound plates ?
lon@@ ely men of middle age love plates .
before you see the comment section in order to over@@ se@@ eding him under the pseud@@ onym non @-@ sam@@ le@@ gen@@ ic defects , this statement leads up from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v the multip@@ lic@@ ity recovery of sound plates do not want to welcome to a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als , which is to welcome the rest@@ ling of physical objects , but on Mid@@ life nost@@ al@@ gia .
those who have recently purchased a plate , are all pre@@ view according to the age between 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most likely buyer group .
there is also no hor@@ des by Hob@@ b@@ ys@@ amm@@ ers - there has been a emotional meaning : older record buyers keep their feelings rather than ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy the time spending time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but are the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
if this blog would be a message report in television , I would follow the camera , while I carry out a modest street in S@@ oh@@ o , a modest grey suit and wild stri@@ ker before I standing , my hands hold and something best determin@@ ants such as : &quot; so , let &apos;s throw a closer look . &quot;
so , let us take a look .
even if the Heart So@@ H@@ os is slowly waiting for its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices , now fill up the buildings where there were once independent sellers - there is a hand@@ ful of fantastic record @-@ specialized shops .
I would ask the camera aman to turn the camera for the next part , in which I &apos;m standing in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to estimate their age and mind through observation .
Stuart from Glasgow , 55 , the I of S@@ ister Ray ( Data : two young women , three men of mean age ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( number of number : eight men of mean age , one woman , probably around the 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through business to fill the few hours .
is it a collector , I wonder ?
&quot; I guess , &quot; says he .
I have about 3.000 or 4,000 sheets .
these sound plates , pictured above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by e @-@ mail , I didn &apos;t have followed him home ) , dressing the walls of his living room .
the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles , is the result of its available income : it is now able to buy records that he could not aff@@ ord to buy articles and buy objects , which he sold , when he was young and ple@@ ite .
&quot; many things I buy , are from the late 60s , early 70 &apos;s , who appeared , when I was 11 or 12 . things I probably had something too young to buy them , &quot; says he .
he is true that those who buy records are rather dis@@ closed and would like to spend alone time , and add : &quot; I smoke not and I drink not much .
that is my l@@ aster .
We@@ z , 25 , who works with S@@ ister Ray , also believes that many customers who meets the You@@ Go@@ v profile .
however , he also noticed a new wave of people who influenced by the Medi@@ enh@@ pe , people who have heard about the com@@ eback in order to buy their old records .
of the convers@@ ations that I have led , people usually have buried their collection in 1998 or 1999 .
customers that once sold their records sold to buy CDs , sell their CDs to buy their records , &quot; says he .
that would explain the boom on app@@ endi@@ ces of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional importance of plates ?
it takes only a few seconds in a business like phon@@ ica to realize that record business offers a soo@@ thing community of equality .
according to We@@ z , some of the older customers participated in the cont@@ act@@ less payment system .
some turn@@ around fans will be overwhel@@ med by the digital world and would like to withdraw the stability of confi@@ dential Schall@@ platten@@ ings , from objects , the happ@@ ier youth agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think sometimes it can be the col@@ t of a void or the possession of the property by a type of comfort , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says We@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is with me as a collector so and I think it is so with many people .
it is a simple way to deal spiritu@@ ally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social worker ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a staff employed from a plate stack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey carried out by the IC@@ M in April , that nearly 50 % of the people who have bought a plate has not yet heard .
the survey also found that 41 % have a turn@@ tables that they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a plate , do not own turn@@ tables .
at this point of the news report I would probably look very wor@@ ried , while I bl@@ oss@@ essed by a stack of Bos@@ sa Nova comp@@ il@@ ations .
J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works at sounds of the Universe ( number of data : three men of middle age ) , has noticed a &quot; t@@ rophy &quot; of the Revi@@ val .
&quot; someone recently returned here and said : &quot; I don &apos;t want a record player , but I would like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead sound plate , that I can put it into the shelf . &quot;
this is not a great percentage , but it definitely happens .
more productive , less musi@@ c@@ ast@@ y .
we have people who say : &quot; I have no turn@@ tables . &quot;
these are younger people , not older who only enter slowly .
F@@ opp , dedicated to the sound plates nearly a whole floor , has a b@@ lower audience , when I am clean .
there are couples around 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ ager and women mean age .
even if the atmosphere is a little less relaxed than in the above @-@ standing stores - Wild Be@@ asts of the latest syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and state @-@ wing pop instead of experimental jazz . it is good to see such a density at the customer .
none of them sees strange , but n@@ ag@@ ating psych@@ matic g@@ mat@@ a are hard at hard , if you are standing for 30 seconds next to someone .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around the store for some minutes and considers the variation of the plates for sale .
it rather makes a sh@@ ov@@ ent ra@@ ve as a big buy @-@ buy .
they don &apos;t des@@ erve a lot , so the Colle@@ ctions of records have no real option , says it .
it costs much .
it is easy to listen to music from a computer or to other way but the beauty of plates is ... &quot; it drives with a del@@ ight@@ ful sig@@ h .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it is really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said that a new generation of record lovers have to be inspired : Urban Out@@ j@@ ams .
while I wish to sample the Je@@ ans Hot@@ p@@ ants , I observe a group of young teen@@ ager , which is based on a moment for pol@@ aro@@ id cameras , before a father and his daughter is superior to buy a Cros@@ ley record player .
on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of plates of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ eh@@ ouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a blend of contemporary music and classi@@ cs that essential plates for an average collection .
no one sees them - perhaps because they are only pure decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to hold them .
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
but in view of that any attraction for these items are more money for the industry and some customers could be sent to the depths of So@@ H@@ os for more , there &apos;s nothing to compl@@ ain about .
it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money as others , also the one that gives most of the luxury objects like boards .
even if my research shows that the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree that the great number of female collectors in S@@ oh@@ o , the great number of female collectors in S@@ oh@@ o , exist in reality , business transactions , and On@@ line@@ for@@ ums exist , not taken into account .
these people probably work hard in school or offices .
they spend their Thursday morning with security on the st@@ roll through sheet shops of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves through plates , while it peaks the star@@ ring view of an un@@ secret , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false moder@@ ator to avoid evil men &apos;s mean age .

French court &apos;s offer on demol@@ ition of shops in the jung@@ le refugee camp
a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of provisional stores and restaurants in the jung@@ le of Cal@@ ais , in which thousands of refugees live .
during a trial of hearing this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais , that the state should be su@@ ck@@ led to sell 72 provisional stores , sell to 72 cents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants .
the Cal@@ ais pre@@ fecture are argu@@ ed that these places should be torn down because they would be a parallel economy , which would not be paid for a parallel economy , and that of a flame and san@@ itation .
humanitarian groups divided the court with that shops and restaurants are important as the free meals that are offered by the nation@@ ally supported association and other groups , not enough food for the growing numbers in the camp .
they also led out that the pro@@ vis@@ ory shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need to offer .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who had the 72 provisional businesses , but dre@@ amed that the concerns of the pre@@ fecture of Cal@@ ais &quot; was absolutely perfect . &quot;
the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that the grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role when people live in extreme pre@@ valent conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas provide quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places that was threatened by the rainfall was the jung@@ le Book kids &apos; cafe of the camp , which is commonly operated and 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as an advice about assign@@ ments for the hundreds of people who accompanied un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0,000 people signed the petition to true the kids &apos; café .
in a letter to the Guardian , it was that the closure &quot; for this children of a disaster would be of which the youngest eight years old are . &quot;
the two aid organisations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge of Mig@@ rants estimated that the number of people increased to over 9,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase of new@@ com@@ ings in the course of summer .

here comes the En@@ forcement trailer
Germany R@@ aser have to set itself on the next generation levels : in different federal states , among other things in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash devices will be tested especially effective .
the fut@@ ur@@ istic En@@ forcement trailer of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example at accidents where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement .
for example , on highway construction sites or to renov@@ ating bridges , there are often no necessary infrastructure to ensure a stationary bl@@ itter for compliance with the speed limit .
a permanent mobile structure can be too dangerous or co@@ stly .
the En@@ forcement trailer is independent : its battery lasts five days , the case data is transmitted via a modem .
with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can also be recorded simultaneously over several tracks .
variable speed limit as well as driving licence according to time , driving strips and vehicle class can also be viewed .
in the up@@ lifting condition you can move the trailer according to manufacturer with each car with trailer hit@@ ch .
so that it is not easy to adjust , it is lowered in the measurement mode , so that the wheels in the pan@@ eled and by the way may disappear in a safe outside cover .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system is to protect the bl@@ itzer before V@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to data from Vit@@ ronic in different federal states and is now also used .
there is also foreign authorities bl@@ ends with the new technique : recently , France has ordered 100 units , after an order of 150 pieces last year .
great Britain brings up silver in 7 @-@ er Rug@@ by , after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class Gold
the impressive performance of Great Britain at the 7 @-@ year Rug@@ by came to a ab@@ rupt stop at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were ro@@ uted with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at De@@ od@@ oro stage here in Rio .
Fi@@ ji invented a master class in the handling , Side @-@ Step@@ ping , After@@ wards , liner and ro@@ cking strength to win gold - their first Olympi@@ an for every color .
the defeat was disp@@ at@@ ched by the non @-@ bad consol@@ ation prize of the silver medal - Great Britain &apos;s fourth day - and they couldn &apos;t be proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which they struck New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ final on the same day could fall back to them in the finals .
but regardless of it Fi@@ ji could have beaten a 15 @-@ man team in the form of this form .
it could be for GB a consol@@ ation - but it is probably not that at least a Br@@ ite morning will have a gold medal around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is head coach Ben Ry@@ an , the former boss for England from Wimbledon .
GB had a difficult road behind him .
eight years ago it was lost at Ry@@ an every game with Adelaide Sev@@ ens .
here they lost only one .
this cap is we@@ ave , but the progress is aston@@ ishing .
Fi@@ ji started wonderful and caused the attacks of the GB@@ S attacks .
it felt like Captain Tom Mitchell and Co . on , when you run in driving buses . the World Series winner went 5 @-@ 0 to the top when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au finished in the corner .
with another four minutes of playing , Jerry Tu@@ wa@@ i released another attack from the right corner , which he walked .
the ball was built between 12 and 0 and GB .
a close leg of Mitchell stops the mountain of Mann Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa a third gate , but it has just stopped Fi@@ ji .
in the seventh minute J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a in the right corner a touch down and there stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the revival and there was still over a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ v@@ ou pre@@ fixes a weak tac@@ kl@@ ings of the UK teams and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
it &apos;s so , when Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while GB still homes .
so it is also .
GB introduced basic changes to half @-@ time through and closed the fi@@ ji@@ ic gap ... for all four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time , until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova ran after a h@@ illi@@ ant intermediate play of Fi@@ ji .
Dan Norton launched an attempt for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went long in favor of the South Africa , whose fans s@@ ni@@ ppers , flags v@@ elled and d@@ anced on the Tri@@ bun@@ e .
it was not difficult to admire the play@@ base Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the i @-@ bag with another attempt in the last seconds .
the P@@ fi@@ ff ert@@ ains that Fi@@ j@@ is turned out and GB are ro@@ asted and defeated in the lawn .
earlier on the day , Fi@@ ji Japan defeated a semi @-@ final with 20 @-@ 5 defeated and Britain pressed South Africa into a cris@@ p half @-@ fin@@ al@@ match from the race - UK &apos;s transformation of difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the boat in the first half to the front , but Dan Norton took the line with an impressive floor work and achieved a gate under the post in the second half .
a brilli@@ antly late tac@@ kling from Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side Teams , secured the winning - and therefore the silver medal .
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning insp@@ ires the fight with the cancer of the trainer for rowing victory
there will be no emotional gold than those games to play and that wants to be called .
from the first stro@@ kes up to the last , 220 hard pulses that enter into history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional significance in her golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even though it was only those who sat at the ru@@ des , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the trainer Robin Williams , was present as she became the second Olympi@@ an in the two without tax woman , the first women in the history of British Sports which had a scale of such a scale .
its domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all of their 3@@ 9.@@ ter use , which is also exempl@@ ary .
what we are visible are two brilliant athletes competing with the elegance of sw@@ ings , what do not reflects the kind of Arc de Tri@@ om@@ phe .
behind each gold in Ru@@ dern , a batt@@ ali@@ on will help to contribute to the incre@@ mental progress , which make up the difference and there was no more beneficial than the trainer , who would not survive that day when he was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said , he ris@@ eth what ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer , which is oper@@ able and they did .
if you do not do that , spreads everywhere .
it would have been quite serious situation .
it has a little a view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the Trio had luck that he could be in the beginning of 2014 , out of season , starting the break at a minimum , if this is the correct term .
I needed money , therefore it had to be better again soon .
it was an incenti@@ ve .
I was in the hospital and ran on the station at around - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough .
that is how it begins .
the rowing is already a challenge , but this makes it even larger .
in the in@@ ability of the victory , their first thought on Williams , who spent a nerv@@ ous morning with it , so much more than otherwise , tried to handle his own fears .
St@@ anning who was as Captain of the Royal Art@@ illery Reg@@ iment in a use in Afghanistan , &quot; I was this week a emotional wreck . this is perhaps something extremely , but it means so much . &quot;
it repe@@ ats only how much I mean that how much I and Helen and also Robin have worked .
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
without Robin , we are no one , therefore a massive Dan@@ ke is going on him . he is the best trainer of the world .
I would have no better person to have a train@@ ee or better coach .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have not lost any race in the last five years .
the pair had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not survive .
even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to susp@@ end , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were caught very at the moment .
Helen called &quot; remain in the process , lasting in the process . &quot;
it is really important to rip itself .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not going to make something pon@@ ds .
we wanted no fire@@ work today , we wanted to score a good result , go out and win the race what we did .
the pair will take a break for one year before it will make decisions about his future .
Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , their own with the TV adventures of your Steve Back@@ shall .
now they just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that my last race was .
that would have too much pressure .
in London it took about six months to realize that I am a Olympic champion .
it was all so new for me and I was so gest@@ ure .
it took about four minutes .
that feels so much better , &quot; she said .

the risk explo@@ ited and energy @-@ based German steel industry remains spar@@ ed from additional costs in million@@ aires h@@ ight .
financial loads , which from the industry , disp@@ at@@ ched from the electricity sector , are of the table .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m really happy that we could finally tell the negotiations after two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the European Commission , according to the European Commission , the Steel producer , which had to use gases from the high burning heat to the use of the burning heat to the checkout .
the steel industry threatened an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year according to German industry associations .
Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , there is a basic certificate with the EU Commission after talks with competition kom@@ mand@@ arin Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only if generators were replaced in steel plants , all an EEG conversion of 20 percent .
but these also will not be raised in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed the agreement in Germany with the EU Commission to present their own production .
this means the status Quo &apos;s status is largely implemented .
special meaning has the successful design of Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Steel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in July , German steel manufacturers remain careful despite increasing prices and increasing orders .
they produced six percent less cru@@ de steel than in the previous year , like the economic association of steel on Friday .
following a short increase in May , the produced quantity returns to the second month in a row .

community , Spirit , health : singing does Sen@@ iors
the singing was accompanied by Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp her whole life : as a young girl she studied the subject of music in the course of apprenti@@ ces@@ hip , and today it s@@ ings the 78 @-@ year @-@ old in a senior citizen .
&quot; I move - emotional and physical , &quot; she describes .
after a rehear@@ sal she feels balanced , mer@@ ry and a total of living , says it .
all of them do good with their health and their spirit .
for singing is equal from several perspectives a great hobby for seniors , Erhard H@@ ac@@ kler says of the German senior league .
most of the seniors in ch@@ orus and divide the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler .
through the regular merger , senior citizens can link social contacts and maintain .
because often social and family structures in the age of , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; to get off and organise themselves to the others - a choir is a very special form of the compositions . &quot;
to sing in the positive sense , H@@ ac@@ kler believes .
for it training seniors a deep and controlled breathing .
anyone who calls his lungs regularly calls itself also in everyday life as fast from the pu@@ rest .
even though it goes to get the sound of the voice at the age , S@@ ingen is an optimal hobby .
on older people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the federal working group of senior citizens .
in the older generations , the joint singing had a much higher job , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and leisure , explains them .
L@@ enz often observed that singing or listening of songs with older people are we@@ aving many memories , often linked with positive feelings of their youth .
by Li@@ ed@@ tex@@ te and especially melo@@ dies themselves de@@ men@@ tia people at long @-@ lying events .
in addition , a special performance requires a special performance , L@@ enz will have a special performance .
at the same time , at the same time , focus on their own voice and to adapt to another rhythm , this is a great cogn@@ itive challenge .
just older people who live alone , do not only practice themselves to concentrate on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition of which by the singing in the choir , H@@ ac@@ kler believes .
an enthusi@@ astic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ est@@ e@@ em is also growing by singing in the choir .
even to show yourself : if I have long for something , I will get better and watch beyond me - this experience strengthens .
good reasons to start with the singing , so it &apos;s enough .
anyone who wants to try out a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he believes , little talent , don &apos;t hesitate .
we s@@ ings not sing alone - at 50 singing people , who hears it if there is a tone beside it ?
in search of the suitable offer , seniors various possibilities , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
s@@ ings someone out of the cow@@ or@@ acle in a nurs@@ ery , you can easily connect .
many cities also offer views over the choirs in the surrounding area .
who wants to sing in a church choir , can turn directly to the church or church leaders .
many homes can be found on the Internet .
if you have no access to the Internet , the family , friends or neigh@@ bors can ask help at the Internet computers .
those who desire to sing , should necessarily be connected to a ch@@ orus , av@@ ac@@ kler .
does the soul sing well and has some liberation - this is true for every age .
cats react sensitive to k@@ itt@@ ens on scre@@ ams
bi@@ ologists investigated in Hanover , what effect the herds of cat @-@ bab@@ ys has grown up to adult animals .
at her surprise , the Mi@@ l didn &apos;t leave the males too cold - however , they kept the difference to the females always .
female cats may recognize the path@@ o@@ gens of Kat@@ zen@@ bab@@ ys on the th@@ aw@@ n of the babies .
they react faster than ten percent faster by k@@ itt@@ ens , who have found themselves in great trou@@ bles as scientists from the veter@@ inary university and the Medical School of Hannover ( MH@@ H ) .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; evi@@ d@@ ently the acoustic differences between the Mi@@ l of less and strongly er@@ ates young for the males either perc@@ ep@@ tible , or not of significance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bi@@ olog@@ in Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said in the MH@@ H . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first version of the study published on this Friday at the BM@@ C Evol@@ u@@ pers Biology . &quot;
in a previous examination , the research team had already found that the duration and pitch of k@@ itt@@ ens @-@ Schre@@ ie diff@@ ers with the pressure of their help .
a total of nine adult men and eight cranes were observed from the end of the MH@@ H .
them were played for a ru@@ fe of little ones , which were taken for three minutes from the root box and separated by mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other hand they were con@@ fron@@ ted with cry of stronger k@@ itt@@ ens which were ro@@ gated in addition .
the researchers maintain their results despite the low sample for sa@@ sa@@ c .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all females , even those who had not yet had their own offspring , re@@ acted to the scre@@ am , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they turned faster to the speakers when this ru@@ fe played the very er@@ ous k@@ itt@@ ens .
this ability could possibly be born or developed with the sexually mature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the males responded to all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bi@@ olog@@ ica &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , scientists have already examined several times the reactions of women and men on baby babies .
Moreover , some studies showed that women are sensitive to inf@@ erior to infants , whether they had already been mothers , or not reported the Bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann .

he finished the season to excellent way and secured the cup of the cup .
thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season for the record champion was a lucky conclusion .
after the Vor@@ round @-@ K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; Lion &quot; also emerged in the Europe League early .
in the South of Li@@ g , it was only rank six .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only possibility to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as running the game year better .
especially thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who played with 26 seasonal figures as Sü@@ ver @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ que , based on the 14th title .
this is also the reason that fans hope for the return of the 31 year old .
in the present time , while the AC Florence had announced under the Treaty and Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as only the i@@ eh@@ ene Gom@@ ez was announced after the coup attempt , due to the political situation in the country after his EM vacation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario must come to us , he must only say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted the journal &quot; K@@ icker &quot; Club Chef F@@ ic@@ ret Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this purpose , the stor@@ ms should be ready to ren@@ ounce the estimated annual sal@@ ms to around one @-@ third of its estimated annual sal@@ ms : &quot; its salary in Florence we cannot pay . &quot;

bomb error in Thailand - Austri@@ ans injured - Sever@@ al dead
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand stand with woman in touch , said spokes@@ person of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ öll , Friday early .
they had suffered , suffered , and had been treated in the hospital , but have already left again .
your home trip is planned for the beginning of September .
whether from other explo@@ sions on vacation in island Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ om@@ phe , also Austrian citizens are still un@@ clear .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will be available in permanent contact with local authorities , such as S@@ öll .
in the approximately 200 kilometres south of Bangkok Hu@@ a H@@ in , Hu@@ a H@@ in were initially explo@@ ded on Thursday night in a f@@ ooth@@ ed two bombs .
according to the police , a Thailand had killed in Thailand and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three German , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
on Friday , two jumps again went up , thereby another human being killed , according to the authorities .
in the morning a bomb det@@ onation was also reported in the morning .
at the Det@@ onation in the vicinity of the popular beach in Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver was injured as a police driver .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani in the south @-@ east coast of the country , a further bomb explo@@ ded , killing a municipal employees .
according to the authorities in a flower shop before the Re@@ four of the coastal police in the air .
finally , det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast as well as in Ch@@ om@@ phe on the south @-@ east coast several injured .
from a connection with explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was called .
&quot; the bomb attack bear the same manuscript , &quot; said the army of Dan@@ ai Crit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday night before journalists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect that it is a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is too early to exter@@ n@@ ally different moti@@ ves - probably it is likely to prevent the works of Muslim reb@@ els .
also Thai media wanted to recognize a pattern that is typical for the bomb attacks in the south of the country .
on the other hand , the Thai police declared that the assassination attempt was not in connection with the Islam@@ ist movement of terrorism or with the international terrorism .
&quot; this is only local Sab@@ ot@@ age , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said one speaker in Bangkok .
it rather assume that the bombs of the ruling military j@@ unta were laid .
the authorities have been in recent days of secret notes on im@@ pending attacks in the South of the country - however , they have not been informed about the exact time and the locations .
it is not clear that the group behind the attacks .
the police pointed out their officials throughout the country , security around important government buildings and airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and am@@ us@@ ement area .
in Thailand there are again smaller bom@@ bers again , but they are mostly not al@@ igned against tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that was used over years from Thailand , king B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
after he explo@@ ded bombs , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs , recommends the instructions of the Thai Security authorities .
high level of safety ( safety level 3 ) sailed for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ iw@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah Vi@@ eil@@ a and its en@@ vir@@ ons .
according to the disp@@ utes between security forces and Muslim populations , not required trips to these provinces are not required .
increased safety risk ( safety level 2 ) sailed for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday maintained a few days after a controversi@@ al referendum on a constitution by the military j@@ unta .
these dre@@ amed the military influence also in the coming years .
Jun@@ ta chief and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Chan @-@ o @-@ CH@@ A said that bombs have been an attempt to kill chaos , while the country is moving towards stability , improvement of economic situation and tourism .
the military j@@ unta , which took power in 2014 after a phase of bloody un@@ rest , the kingdom holds itself again to have stability and order .
however , the military did not succeed in order to get the insur@@ rection of the country of mus@@ li@@ ous reb@@ els since years in the utter@@ most parts of the country .
more than 6500 people were killed in the conflict .
almost a year ago , in Bangkok at a stop on a popular Hin@@ du @-@ scra@@ per was killed 20 people - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloody appearance of the younger history of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ident@@ it@@ alian Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the vis@@ or of the Federal Office for constitutional protection &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after several govern@@ ors , the constitu@@ ency of the federal government had given the group under observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ident@@ itic Motion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for rank@@ ings against the freedom of democratic rules , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the German press agency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the German press agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
such become diff@@ am@@ inated with different Islamic faith or the Middle East in the extrem@@ ist manner .
therefore we observe the movement now .
the &quot; Ident@@ itic movement &quot; is a group of a group of French roots that has been active in Germany since 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she turns against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mul@@ tic@@ ul@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; un@@ controlled mass migration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; loss of own identity due to foreign identity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the constitu@@ tional@@ ist in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thuring@@ ia - observe the &quot; ident@@ ities . &quot;
Ma@@ ate said that his authority has been closely matched with the country &apos;s decision .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups like the &apos; Ident@@ it@@ cip@@ alities &apos; are trying to fet@@ ch their target group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Constitutional Court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gen &apos;@@ ral try extrem@@ ists to contact with you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ le music .
the Islam@@ ist Islam@@ ists likewise as right @-@ wing religious .
this is not oblig@@ atory advertising for your own thing .
prop@@ aganda is expected to talk emot@@ ion .
young people are due in special manner .
this is dangerous .
it was recently given from several German states on contacts of the &quot; Ident@@ itic &quot; to Af@@ D policy .
Ma@@ ate said he did not find in@@ sights .
for the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this type can be relevant only from a certain point .
it comes to whether the relevant party - in this case the Af@@ D - through certain people , the extrem@@ ist , change their target , and so extrem@@ ist .
it is decisive for such persons who controls the party &apos;s influence on the party .
this is not recogni@@ z@@ able .
with a view to the significant increase of right @-@ in @-@ scale pen@@ alties and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers , Ma@@ ate , he would not talk about new rights in this context .
but we &apos;ve found in recent years that it can give the justi@@ fy structures .
there were the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Friday group .
it may well be that further am@@ ster@@ ile group@@ ings or small groups are planning to plan the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee camps or attacks from other right @-@ wing moti@@ ves .
however , a German @-@ wide or European control of legal terrorism but is not recogni@@ z@@ able .
the present groups were created on the regional level or in social networks .
in fact , Ma@@ ate concerned about that many survi@@ vor@@ s went to the account of people who didn &apos;t have occurred in the right scene in App@@ ear@@ ance .
this is the concern .
many of the facts on attack on asylum seek@@ ers are not known as crime , polit@@ ically motiv@@ ated offen@@ ders or followers on the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so many people have committed criminal off@@ ences which previously had nothing in the tur@@ ban on the hat , who were perhaps polit@@ ically in@@ different , or for example CDU , SPD or Lin@@ ke , who , however , have radic@@ alised &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pione@@ ering spirit &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

he simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut@@ out was selected .
in the social networks , Hab@@ te was then transferred to the vir@@ al inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ended with a return of 48 seconds and took the 59@@ th place of 59 starters .
but it was rather his just spor@@ tive figure , which attracted the attention of international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old nonetheless particip@@ ates in the Olympic Games ?

some media recorded him as &quot; RO@@ B@@ EL of W@@ hal@@ e . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the English Bou@@ lev@@ ard@@ blatt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made it very funny . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his time , he stroke only with one minute and almost five seconds about the 100 meters Freestyle , there was no role .
compare with &quot; Eric the E@@ EL &quot; were also drawn .
with the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney , Eric Mou@@ ss@@ am@@ ban@@ i run for media attention .
unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool from Et@@ qu@@ at@@ orial Guinea when he had to compete in a pre@@ run over 100 meters of Freestyle alone .
fr@@ en@@ et@@ ically , Mou@@ ss@@ am@@ ban@@ i was fired at that time .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned only eight months before the Olympic swimming and had never completed a long distance before the competition .

accidents - Bus sli@@ pped in cr@@ um@@ m@@ ns in sizes : eight injured
when an accident of a touring coach with 43 senior citizens were killed on Thursday in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ ns ( Landkreis Aur@@ i ) eight people were injured .
two of the occup@@ ants suffered severe injuries , the police divided .
the 66 @-@ year @-@ old chassis of a travelling company from Eisen@@ ach had to express their details according to a counter@@ pass , which drove off on the counter @-@ road .
the bus came to the right from the road and sli@@ pped into a tomb , like a spokes@@ woman of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the location of the bus , people could not leave the bus independent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire brig@@ ade liberated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ance cars and an ambul@@ atory cars arrived at Landes@@ strasse 2 .
the most recent trav@@ ellers have been driven by a liner bus back to the Kr@@ um@@ m@@ ett@@ ner district of P@@ ew@@ sum .
there they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company .
the investig@@ ator demanded the lor@@ ry and possible witnesses to report to the police .
the fees per cubic metre of wast@@ ew@@ ater amount to 2,@@ 10 euros for the area of san@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sch@@ ahl / L@@ opp 3.@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 26 euros ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 18 euros ) .
the waste disposal at the A@@ endorf plant will increase the waste disposal at the latest , if corresponding improvement measures will be necessary .
the waste price in Az@@ endorf will be at 4,@@ 37 euros per cubic meter .
as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , it was determined by the land@@ lord of the land@@ lor@@ ry by Land@@ rat@@ ory and Kul@@ mb@@ ach for these san@@ itation systems .
the Kas@@ endorf market is oblig@@ ated to operate on the basis due to the right basis to operate plants .
from October 1 , 2016 , citizens and industrial enterprises from Wel@@ sch@@ ema , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg must hold deeper into the pur@@ se .
the commission increases between 48 and 67 percent .
as Chairman of the Board of Directors , Herbert Schmidt was necessary , a re@@ iter@@ ate of the fees for se@@ wer@@ age in the market community was necessary .
in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , overseas and sub@@ missions from the previous cal@@ cul@@ ation period are due .
with all three se@@ wer@@ ies , Schmidt introduced this , that there are relatively small establishments in all three se@@ wer@@ age , with a very low se@@ ash@@ ings , which fly between 6@@ 800 and 12000 cubic meters per year .
thus , due to the small distribution basis , for example , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would be gra@@ vi@@ able .
the waste drainage should also be slightly down@@ wards in all three systems .
in the past Kal@@ cul@@ ation period in all three systems not last due to their age san@@ itation and repair expend@@ itures in a substantial amount .
the plant in Az@@ endorf was nearly 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ sch@@ os@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth and Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp almost 20 years .
Schmidt proved that the A@@ endorf san@@ itation system had to be replaced with the mechanical ventilation system due to any damage .
in the pump Wel@@ sch@@ ka the almost 20 years old conveyor systems had to be over@@ taken and carried out during the pond . after almost 20 years of operation , the first hardness has had to be fitted and an additional ventilation is needed to keep the legal regulations in the future .
Schmidt : &quot; this extraordinary expenses came into account for these extraordinary expenses and maintenance costs which are to be considered in the new calendar period . &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs which remained significantly below the current level during the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012 .
stone houses made clear that in the low se@@ wage treatment in the three plants the expenses for the operation and maintenance &quot; were fully through . &quot;
thereby , added Schmidt , the market leader of large entertainment costs for se@@ wer@@ age in the past 20 years has been spar@@ ed .
the situation for the af@@ ore@@ mentioned plants will continue to stay according to the view of stone cottages , especially since you can &apos;t extend the supply area of the Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ acht@@ al area around these installations because it is de@@ centr@@ alized facilities .

snap@@ shot filter has drawn in the past critic@@ isms that they were accused of having accused the ap@@ face @-@ change or white skin as a beauty ideal .
when this week , some Uz@@ be@@ ers hit a filter that gave them sli@@ pping , false teeth and raised W@@ angen , called it some critics on Asi@@ ans - &quot; yel@@ or@@ naments from Asi@@ ans . &quot;
they asked whether these repeated control beams relate to a larger problem that the company has di@@ spar@@ ity with di@@ spar@@ ity .
the news and the indig@@ nation were widely used on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and motherboard , one day after Snap@@ chat hur@@ ried that it would have the feature .
the company offered an exc@@ use : the filter was thought as a homage to An@@ ime characters and not as cartoon by Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ sider that rac@@ is@@ sm@@ us experienced , remin@@ ded the filter at infr@@ ing@@ ing c@@ lich@@ és .
others decided to compare an@@ ime comparison .
in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani wrote , a Korean @-@ American art student , whose holding was widespread over the photos far , that the filter &quot; viol@@ ently was un@@ pleasant . &quot;
she added that &quot; it is difficult to argu@@ ing a very conflic@@ ting Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects .
it shows that the filter is not successful , but that the yel@@ lowing of the yel@@ low@@ ns was removed .
snap@@ chat is not the only company that crossed this cultural per@@ per@@ ate .
the American culture seems to be involved in an endless di@@ vers@@ eness and integ@@ rating lamps , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we keep all in the hand .
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats big audience young people - who are in the race of various opponents as their older counter@@ players - could not go out to expect sen@@ si@@ vity .
if one of snap@@ shot fil@@ tering a picture creates that for a user bel@@ ong@@ ated , it is much more difficult to remain un@@ noticed when it was the case earlier , the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Zh@@ u said in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday , Zh@@ u decided to work as a product manager and engineering in medium , her Snap@@ chat account asked to delete others to do it .
in a set of medium and in a phone interview , she said that they think that small @-@ related contro@@ vers@@ ations reflected a lack of di@@ vers@@ eness at Snap@@ chat .
Zh@@ u critic@@ ized the big part white , only male leadership and ended its ess@@ ay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; either , they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , &quot; said the Chinese city Zh@@ u , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that are working there , but not in positions , in which they are safe or well to say what to say . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint , the Snap@@ chat largely left un@@ answered .
the company released no numbers on the ability of its staff and points to its status as a private company .
on Thursday , there are Snap@@ chat to discuss the cultural back@@ grounds of his employees , but according to a spokes@@ man , the company recently decided to focus a staff responsible for under@@ going population groups and on internal integration tests .
Zh@@ u said that she will leave their Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more user like us to say that this is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
military transfer of IS@@ IS secret information , introduces Committee of Congress Center
the United States Central Command Central Command has changed detailed information to mark an optim@@ istic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria as it allowed the actual states of Congress in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the Republi@@ can members of the dispute , intelligence agencies , and military bud@@ get@@ ary states , reported by a great dis@@ satisfaction at Central Command Intelligence Command , which reported to change their ass@@ ess@@ ments to the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
Central Command , short C@@ enc@@ om , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; news service information that were typically ab@@ sent by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com for terrorism than the actual states were allowed and were consistently positive than analyses of other news services , &quot; cited a newspaper article about the report .
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is un@@ acceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; Ken Cal@@ ver@@ t , Republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives .
the head office in Cent@@ Com is sufficient until the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the formation of the Iraqi forces .
although there are no direct indications that government peaks are given under Obama instruction , it shows how an@@ alysts predi@@ ct their predecess@@ ors , an optim@@ istic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or I@@ si@@ l .
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command releases , opinions and statements before the Congress were clearly positive when it corresponds to the facts . &quot;
for example , Cent@@ Com was publicly known that a military occupation of Mos@@ cons@@ ulate could begin in April or May 2015 .
Muslims , the second largest city of Iraq remains under the control of Islamic State .
&quot; after months of investigations , it is so clear . &quot; Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Congress held at Kansas , in a position .
from the middle of 2014 until the middle of the year 2015 , the Central Command Central Command has changed the following reports to play the risk by IS@@ IS in Iraq .
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans called the Task Force , after playing them that an@@ alysts were wor@@ ried about the Islamic State concerning the man@@ ipulation of reports .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by detailed findings during the investigations .
in addition , further investigations of Cent@@ Com reports are represented by the General Insp@@ ector of the Ministry of Defence in G@@ ange .
the members of the news service committee published on Thursday their own findings , which coinci@@ de with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com founded a revised process for the creation of post @-@ based obj@@ ection to I@@ si@@ l and Iraqi Security Services , &quot; the highest peak of the Com@@ intern , became a member of the House of Represent@@ atives , Adam B. Ship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , the Mr. ship , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delayed publication of downstream reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Mor@@ al an@@ alysts &apos; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave a little space for different opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and Democrats gave no evidence for an intervention of the White House at Cent@@ Com An@@ alysts on a &quot; certain political opinion . &quot;
preliminary results of the Congress of the Congress were published on Tuesday through &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast &quot; on Tuesday .
last August , the New York Times was reported by investig@@ ations@@ by the Pentagon , which were recorded after complaints from Cent@@ Com an@@ alysts .
Lt@@ . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a press @-@ pre@@ cher of the Pentagon , gave birth to a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the Congress , while the investigations of the General@@ be@@ v@@ urs will be still underway .
but he also reported that &quot; experts sometimes quite di@@ verg@@ ating opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data , and that the news services and the Ministry of Defence welcomed a controversi@@ al discussion of these important topics of the national defence . &quot;
the investigations have re@@ per@@ cussions about the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a asser@@ tion that is made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
however , the alleg@@ ations of the last year however , however , President Obama decided to rely on the Central Command for hon@@ our@@ ing military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya , and other crisis regions .
the criticism of about the Islamic State recall some more than ten years ago as a Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st , Gregory Hoo@@ ker , a correspondence over it , like the former government under George W. Bush , looked forward a little crew of troops in Iraq and a little time on it to make the consequences of the invasion of 2003 .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the uprising against the current coverage of the Islamic State .
last year , the team presented by Mr. Hoo@@ ker according to government agencies that had no significant impacts on the financial situation of the terrorist group , had no significant impacts on the financial situation of the terrorist group since these pro@@ vis@@ or@@ ical refin@@ eries were put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market .
however , this knowledge was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ ous commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legisl@@ ature due to his super@@ bly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate .
General Austin went into retirement in April , and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the US win fourth match in the field of hockey of women , a show@@ down with Britain before
one day after they had shot three goals during one 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American Feld@@ ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two games should actually be a memor@@ able performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said they could not remember that ever happened .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their gates in memory .
however , this is what they are : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 at the Olympic Contest and are equally among the first place to remain un@@ defeated in their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
great Britain and the United States will come on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ final , the game will decide which the two will win the first and second place within their group .
the first @-@ placed car is slightly longer from the way that the other group will lead to the other group .
as always the game may go out on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising host , four years after they landed in the last London Games on the last of 12 places .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a hockey ra@@ cket ( her two older sisters played the sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
it missed the Olympi@@ ad in 2008 because they could not qualify for the driver .
then came the year 2012 , in which she and her team got everything .
in the subsequent year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the hub , and thus began to turn the things for better .
&quot; a culture change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am .
we did not work the work in London that we have now .
we can rip the ru@@ der completely .
on Thursday night , B@@ am opened the Tor@@ rei@@ gen in the first half of the game with a set@@ back out of the se@@ am .
India had gone without victory in the tournament in the game , but the team proved to be sur@@ pris@@ ingly tough and kept the playing stand from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter , until B@@ am the game in her hands .
she completed a spr@@ int with the flat flan@@ k over the left flan@@ k , then moved to the ball in the middle and l@@ up@@ turn the ball in the gate to open a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last four .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the tournament for the Tor@@ keeper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who previously had to pay a goal in each of the previous games .
it has a run .
same as B@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in a good position &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
am@@ id@@ st the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the tramp@@ ol@@ ines
wherever you are too late , as late as it is , the Olympic Games are .
the events in Rio de Janeiro are durable and in@@ sof@@ tened , a rapid relay between competition and stre@@ ches .
it is when the Olympic tor@@ ch itself would be a burning rod , which protect from the bracelet for s@@ wimm@@ ers for tri@@ athletes .
you cannot read the TV , read a newspaper or listen to her neighbours in the maintenance @-@ long in Coff@@ es@@ hop , without about Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ bert or the battle between Michael Ph@@ el@@ ps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a lady of black with dimples , could have been sent to the Prime Time , based on sponsors and well @-@ listed TV advertising when it was a s@@ wimm@@ ers , Turner or even F@@ real .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , was fighting in the Olympic tramp@@ ol@@ ines by gold .
the Olympic flame illumin@@ ates no event .
further from the center , some in the shade are the sports that are not recognized : air pist@@ ol shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ w@@ ondo .
we will always have the chest swimming and may have to rule long .
but if I want to make a modest arguments for my particular lovers , then let me take the attention to the discre@@ et charm of the tramp@@ ol@@ ines .
although the tr@@ amp jump already has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had his debut in Sydney , it was the last 16 years so many those that I asked , did not know that it is a Olympi@@ as@@ ome .
this could be regional Ig@@ no@@ anz .
although the USA sent athletes for competition , it has never gained a medal in the tramp@@ ol@@ ines and had a athletes until 2012 , who made it to the final round .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to divide the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadian who are to share for women .
Dong Dong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ Lenn@@ on from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
the tramp@@ ol@@ in@@ tro has some exterior char@@ me , partly because it sounds for the in@@ corrup@@ ted ear for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ schule as the for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should ad@@ mit that I &apos;m not an expert but only a bound enthusi@@ ast .
it has hum@@ orous potential - the cart@@ o@@ on@@ ous trem@@ bling of his never to end , but also the gra@@ zie of gymn@@ ast@@ ens and diving , the two sports , that combines it mainly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trampoline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , which means so much means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; jumps &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ski@@ pping winner jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and need a number of falling movements ( turning , H@@ real and sal@@ tos ) before they landing on the feet .
they will be assessed according to the official Olympic Committee , difficulty , difficulty and flight time .
two @-@ und@@ ated athletes from 17 countries , 16 males and 16 women who compete against each other in Rio .
the common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ ble must continue in their stre@@ ches after gold , faster , upward and dr@@ on , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes go and back , after top and down at the playground .
they ch@@ ase not only the finish line or the output level , but in the TV broadcast also another cav@@ ity goal : the world or the Olympi@@ ad .
the targeted head@@ lines is the Nobel , ad@@ mi@@ red , even fan@@ atic - and it &apos;s enough to stir even a spect@@ ator to tears .
but it is also what I want to look at this games as something tired .
the trampoline offers a breathing break .
the v@@ ector of the tramp@@ ol@@ ines is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
he or she pr@@ all@@ t , seem@@ ingly heavy metals like a ast@@ ron@@ aut , goes down to the top , then go back up again .
also here is a contest , of course not without difficulty , but during exercise there is no h@@ ec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves in the distance , only the dre@@ aming , elegant repe@@ al of time and gravity .
it is so Zen as the competition only can be at the Olympic Games .
the quali@@ fications and final wounds of the women will take place on Friday afternoon in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13.00 .
N@@ BC will exu@@ de the end of a afternoon block of 2 days from 14.00 .
in the middle of the Olympia Man@@ ie , they promise a quiet , nice moment , who is likely to see in general tum@@ ult .
if the consciousness could only be achieved by the attacks and the object of male athletes , as it became the male US Turner at the The Wall Street Journal recently - and then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey awaits its following the air , new fan community .
&quot; a generation prot@@ ested &quot; in Ethiopia , long a ban on the United States
violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators that require political changes in Ethiopia , shooting down on violent resistance of the government .
witnesses say that only Protestant during inter@@ c@@ ashes with the police have been killed .
is Ethiopia right now ?
in the last ten years , it was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid associate of West Africa with a rapidly growing economy .
but in recent months , protests against the government sh@@ ook the country and far more areas .
last week , thousands of people stor@@ med on the streets and desired political changes .
according to human rights organisations , the government was un@@ mer@@ ciful .
witnesses said that polic@@ emen tried to kill and killed police officers .
in circulation , videos about the protests , probably from the last or beginning of this year , show how security professionals young people with st@@ akes , while these were forced to make a hand against a wall .
the chief of the UN authority for Human Rights demands an ongoing examination .
&quot; it was always difficult to hold this land and in future , it will even be even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group .
Ethiopia is the most populated country of Africa , and its stability is estimated from the West .
American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians , in order to fight terror over the region , especially in Somalia . only few countries in Africa , if ever , get so much western help .
Ethiop@@ ian economy expanded in the remarkable pace .
its infrastructure has dra@@ stically improved - there is a new comm@@ uter train in Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba &apos;s capital .
the streets are generally quiet , safe and clean .
even if Ethiopia was all other as a model for democracy - human rights organisations have led the repression caused by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted , the dis@@ sidents were effective for silence .
many were sent into exile or prison , killing or put into the wilderness of the wilderness .
but that could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you supp@@ ress people and don &apos;t have any other options except , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in Central Ethiop@@ ian &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the entire youth protest@@ ers .
a generation were protest@@ ing .
there are numerous complaints , which cover everything from the bottom of land until the wor@@ r@@ ying handle in relation to power of the reg@@ ained coalition .
after a far @-@ term critical election of last year , the ra@@ iny party and its allies got the last seat of the opposition , and now serves 100 percent of the parliament .
at the same time , the ten@@ sions along the border to Erit@@ rea ; a fight for this z@@ ag , controversi@@ al line demanded in June hundreds of lives .
analysis fears that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the O@@ rom@@ o Liberation Front , or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , which were more or less , were able to protect tur@@ bul@@ ences and can be armed .
to explain several factors why feelings of the bit@@ ing after years ago explo@@ de in the surface explo@@ de .
the first seems harm@@ less : smartphones .
only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians were able to communicate using the social media , because cheaper smartphones have been more frequently and improved the Internet services .
even when the government closed the access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do in regular intervals , especially with protests , many people can still communicate over the internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide it up .
several young Ethiop@@ ians stated that they gathered themselves as protests .
the second factor is that there are more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two biggest eth@@ nic@@ ations in Ethiopia .
Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
since branches , the Am@@ har@@ as , which come from branches of the predominantly of Christian high countries , in politics and economy , while they explo@@ ited the Oro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are living and living in flat areas .
but this also changes .
&quot; we are here to coordin@@ ate under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos .
the most important protests were held in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tig@@ ray , which accounts for about 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military , in the secret services , and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former re@@ bel leader , was held until his death at a non @-@ public disease in 2012 , 17 years of Ethiop@@ ians Prime Minister .
he was considered a tac@@ tical gen@@ ius , a man who could think about corners .
an@@ alysts predi@@ ct that he was especially advis@@ able to use early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and special promotions to make ad@@ missions and to make them un@@ harmful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime is missing in this basic &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analyses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiop@@ ian new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen out of relatively un@@ transparent reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
other than Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of northern Ethiopia , Mr H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am coming from the south .
analy@@ st say that he doesn &apos;t enjoy the trust of the Tig@@ ray controlled security services .
many believed that the result will be more blood .
the last time that Ethiopia had such an u@@ pro@@ ar in 2005 , after thousands of elections were protest@@ ed , according to the information provided by analy@@ tics , and then stolen from the government .
during the following Raz@@ or , many protest@@ ers were killed , even though it were less than in the last months and that time of the rest went relatively rapidly .
Ethiop@@ ian leader for its visionary infrastructure planning , as the new comm@@ uter train , as well as for its meas@@ ur@@ able progress in poverty .
but apparently this does not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal mis@@ ery of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
the last month there were protest@@ ant in Gon@@ dar , a am@@ har@@ ic city , from Tig@@ ray , and the hat@@ red towards the tig@@ ray will always be experienced in the social media .
analy@@ st say that protests brought the U.S. and other Western allies in a separate position .
the American government used the Ethiopia as the basis for d@@ ron@@ en@@ flights on the neighboring Somalia , even if she has recently over@@ looked this base .
during the West clearly wants to support democracy , he doesn &apos;t want to switch to his ban in a vol@@ at@@ ile area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , Mr. Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin passage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his statement Obama established IS@@ IS &quot; in Sar@@ cas@@ mus .
Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to scatter on Friday the last contro@@ vers@@ y to scatter his campaign by taking his multiple repeated statement , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the Islamic State of Islamic State , not serious .
this clari@@ fication designed new issues to communicate the presidential candidate of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans if it is able to communicate clear and under@@ stand@@ able with the American public .
it also brings its co @-@ stri@@ pe , who ende@@ av@@ oured to take him during an event@@ ful phase in protection to explain statements , which he could not have meant .
after having made the announcement of a election event on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump came back to the claim on Thursday and existed in interviews that he really was not intended to signi@@ fying the President and Mrs. Clinton had been created IS@@ IS .
but in an early morning , Mr. Tr@@ ump , he is just a sar@@ cop@@ ic .
in contrast to the previous day , Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews , he said the alleg@@ ations completely seriously .
when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ bie Hug@@ h He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tr@@ ump wanted to help the statement about anything , which Mr. Obama wants to destroy him that Mr. Obama wanted no harm to the Republi@@ can presidential candidate .
the last storm of cr@@ iti@@ que impact on Mr. Tr@@ ump , while he tries the focus of his campaign due to decline to the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton held spe@@ ech@@ es to the economic situation in Michigan this week .
on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return on this topic .
on Twitter , he war@@ ned that Mrs. Clin@@ ton &apos;s suggestions would lead to higher taxes , and that he was found bor@@ ing their talk .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
at the end of July , he became strong cr@@ iti@@ que on himself , when he thought , the Russians should Mrs. Clin@@ ton Ema@@ ils , but he explained later , &quot; Of course I meant the sar@@ ist . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the language limits in politics and then return to ru@@ de .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is one of his methods to test like certain messages from his fans , as they arrive , and then if &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication experts who observed the language of both candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but I believe it is cle@@ ver enough to keep his statements enough , so that they can be interpreted in different ways .
instead of the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump knew an even more corrosive tone as its surveys have gone further .
a new survey conducted by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist who was published on Friday , showed a lead with a big lead in the Federal States North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado , and head @-@ to @-@ head @-@ race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump is trying to exc@@ use himself for his pro@@ vocation , he accused his critics to understand his statements , or to understand his hum@@ or .
but while he is ampli@@ fied in the focus of the attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps Scher@@ ze his lo@@ y@@ alen leaders have to be brought to him , regardless of how prov@@ ok@@ ant will be his statements .
Rud@@ olph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ um@@ ps , prominent inter@@ c@@ ession , gave great effort to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview from Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says , political Comments &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said , Giuli@@ ani said to the judgment of Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps statements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in this sense that Obama IS@@ IS had an almost unknown , small organization , he called her back@@ ben@@ der , completely false and therefore happened because he moved the troops from Iraq .
most ma@@ inst@@ re@@ am rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to argu@@ ing that Mrs. Clinton served as an outdoor Minister , IS@@ IS allowed IS@@ IS allowed to spread out the situation in the Middle East .
prior to the election race events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and threw them on each of his words , and to be advised against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he dis@@ solves the &quot; poor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; TV experts who try to understand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you cannot do it ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the Democrats sp@@ ired over Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps exc@@ els as merely a further evidence that he was not suitable for the presidential office .

Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived previously in William@@ sburg and visited the ver@@ b regularly .
even after having moved to Green@@ point , she would take the way to itself .
after the ver@@ b had closed , she gave birth to a while , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was clear that it was pleasing in the coffee and the culture in the Ver@@ b , who pleased me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now they drinks coffee , even if they were in this day instead of their usual I@@ ced Coff@@ ees , a Bl@@ ended C@@ hai Tea ordered , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been another long@@ standing and faithful client since the beginning of the Ver@@ b in 2003 .
he went there before the work , and he appointed not the same .
&quot; I got a quarter after seven , every day like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; he said .
photo Rodri@@ guez , he wanted to experiment and record new ingredients into the menu .
nowadays Ros@@ enthal gets still his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ guez said that he has no idea about that the soap store has taken the old business room .
in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie to produce a special soap for ver@@ b with the cold fried coffee of the coffee bar as ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will go down on their offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ guez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional , Polish population Green@@ points have also accepted the café .
a new customer has translated the menu to Polish and Rodri@@ guez said that he fore@@ seen it soon , so that his new neigh@@ bors welcome you .
the site has also further advantages .
a local saf@@ te@@ locally wants to fill in the cold fried coffee in bottle and sell .
there is a chance that the café expands to a neighboring building .
for many customers a new ver@@ b is enough to get their old favorites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a pedi@@ atri@@ ation and said that he was destroyed in the ground when the café closed .
when the new Café opened , Wh@@ itt said that the praying at the location and a new coff@@ ees felt like a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; I had to smell it , &quot; he said .
the de@@ pri@@ ming food of the economic crisis in a rich meal &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his asc@@ ension , Franklin Del@@ ano Roosevelt took part in the Oval Office .
as a Fein@@ schm@@ ecker , President Roosevelt had a F@@ ai@@ ble for refined delic@@ acy at Fifth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de Fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland water @-@ signs soup .
his menu on this day was something modest : filled eggs in Tom@@ at@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , potato pur@@ ée and as dess@@ erts a p@@ ud@@ ding p@@ ud@@ ding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with the people , &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man .
her husband , Andrew Co@@ e , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans , as they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food hist@@ ori@@ ans .
Co@@ es last book &quot; CH@@ OP Su@@ ey &quot; tra@@ ded by the Chinese cuisine in the USA while Zi@@ egel@@ man told her book &quot; 97 Or@@ chard &quot; about life in a residential building at the Lower East Side from the food perspective .
your newest collaboration , &quot; A constant meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at the Har@@ per Publishing House , illustrates the history of American kitchen during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity , when they meet with a repor@@ ter at the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s sandwich shop for dinner , a small , gra@@ vel@@ ous Im@@ bis@@ cu@@ ous Im@@ bis@@ ron in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since its stock market crash in 1929 .
Zi@@ egel@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese with oli@@ v@@ estones , while Co@@ e , 57 , Tru@@ th@@ ahn with potato pur@@ ée and mixture .
as a repor@@ ter in Hack@@ ney , this was the pair for a discussion about food in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man .
there were pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
they were made from a ingredient and a little cheap , which scat@@ tering the ingredient .
imagine , so many pe@@ an@@ uts eat that they serve them as dinner .
CO@@ E grin@@ ds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have been in the stomach as lead in lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ you @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
teams of women sal@@ ts for male field staff and it was served as a fresh past@@ ed past@@ ed for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
it was the Americans that sent food to hunger during the first world war . &quot; A Square Me@@ al &quot; shows the way to which the country went with it , no longer to be the Schl@@ ar@@ aff@@ enland .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time while eating for the Americans a central , gradu@@ ating theme was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; claimed co@@ e , why he and his wife would write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new Bud@@ get@@ di@@ bility : mysterious food like bread and cass@@ ettes have been revealed to basic food , the c@@ ens@@ ity recovered as &quot; wonderful way , food remains re@@ mun@@ eration , &quot; I noticed Zi@@ che un@@ appet@@ ite ingredients under a creative sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dry matter .
meat that had been the central part of the American kitchen was to become a rare ser@@ rated luxury .
specifically the mixtures were tried , as a cal@@ orie @-@ rich and nutr@@ itious exc@@ itement was deemed to taste or even healthy kitchen .
during their research for the book , which includes recipes , Zi@@ egel@@ man prepared a dish from this ep@@ och , fried onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was no more popular addition at noon , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zi@@ egel@@ mann moves further : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and fried onions do not match to each other .
it was typical for many of the utility recipes .
as never before or since then , the budget of bud@@ dies - including Louise Stanley , leader of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - the essence of the country .
by taking them recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines published , they encourage women to become &quot; House@@ sp@@ ol@@ iti@@ ves &quot; and the Challenge , P@@ amp@@ e like cre@@ amy sp@@ aghetti with carrots in delicious dishes to be justified .
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a celebration of historic le@@ ak@@ ages .
in particular , the reports about the answer of the government to star@@ ving citizens , as President Herbert Hoo@@ vers L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ Cake @-@ Essen @-@ attitude .
while he enjoyed the simple I@@ owa farm@@ houses in his kitchen , he sp@@ it as the million severe man of the world , to whom he has become .
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with Gur@@ k@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , &quot; said Co@@ e .
he ate in an almost gilded food room and wore a Smoking .
he was del@@ ight@@ ful realistic .
President Roosevelt would perhaps have committed the same error , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had to accept him on his stomach with his stomach .
as described in the book , the today &apos;s house@@ keeper with no interest in flav@@ ours by Ms. Roosevelt said that the White House brought the most bor@@ ing food in Washington , but also one of the most difficult food . &quot;
many of the species from the era of great depression to deal with food , was rejected when the country came back to the legs .
the legacy lies on our continuing focus on calories and nour@@ ishment , Zi@@ egel@@ man , as well as on how science was applied on food .
the couple delivered in writing the eating hab@@ its of Zi@@ egel@@ mans in law in law - for example , as they could not throw away food .
&quot; she had a real fear of food , &quot; Co@@ e said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man rec@@ alled : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she really made people sick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the wind flow .
after the plates were cleared at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they moved and Co@@ e came out a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pr@@ un@@ ning of the ice , the President Roosevelt at noon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man and added that there was a common tri@@ ck , a modest recipes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were no proposed cream , only p@@ eg@@ s , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everybody di@@ pped somewhat contra@@ di@@ ct a spo@@ ons in the teeth , brown Gli@@ b@@ ber .
sorry , it was not bad .
CO@@ E won three times a night .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ get@@ op@@ iers , he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at Bom@@ b attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed Omar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed Omar dedicated his life to the people in Syria .
he ris@@ ky everything to save the lives of their lives .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old himself died with a fac@@ ial attack against the Assad regime .
Omar was a member of &quot; White Hel@@ mets , &quot; a civilian protection group that saved the life according to the image newspaper so far nearly 60,000 people .
29@@ 00 Vol@@ unte@@ ers put their own life on the game to pull people out of the bom@@ bed houses and to aff@@ ord first aid in the war area .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
Omar was the face of the group : a video of Civil@@ ization , which shows him at a 11 @-@ hour salvation from a house of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syrians to the bright symbols in the size of the war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when heroes never saw himself , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is the real Ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I die to save lives , I think that God sees me a mart@@ yr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before Omar had taken an attack by an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bomb attacks in Syria .
the hel@@ ik@@ op@@ ter have rejected four versions over the Alz@@ adia district , which was filled with chlor@@ ophyll .
a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from breathing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let us kill the remains of the bomb , so that no children may play , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture quotes his last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the dead@@ ly bomb of the Assad regime had to meet terror@@ ists .
Greenland : the oldest ed@@ dy is nearly 400 years old
more rare sight .
Greenland &apos;s hair usually come to the surface only in winter .
this Hai was allowed to return on board ship S@@ anna to the sea after an investigation on board .
it was born in 16@@ 24 and s@@ wimm@@ ers with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie get only 150 years of offspring .
on average , the Greenland &apos;s ground level , in an hour , on average , it is just 1,@@ 220 meters far away .
only when it comes down , the five metre long animal accelerates from a full 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a Rob@@ be .
this lon@@ el@@ iness lifestyle seems to be a sponsor@@ ship for a high age .
Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; Science &quot; in any of Greenland , the 392 years old .
&quot; mad@@ ness , &quot; commented Alexander Sch@@ eu@@ er@@ lein of the Max Planck Institute for demo@@ graphic Research in Rostock which means a world record for verteb@@ rates .
indeed , the ev@@ olu@@ tionary biolog@@ ist suspected that Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie will be old .
just missing the evidence .
Greenland &apos;s hair@@ y are difficult to observe , finally , they live mainly in the polar sea before the thin@@ ly populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ b@@ ard .
because they prefer water @-@ temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , immer@@ se them on the surface usually only in winter .
about the lifestyle of Greenland , researchers have to know according to little .
your tim@@ es@@ up@@ un@@ emp@@ o lim@@ bs it , when they took six animals in front of top six animals with a transmitter .
the prey make this hair nevertheless : in the stomach of a beast found the remains of a Rob@@ be , another one had b@@ lown the or@@ bones of a young Eis@@ b@@ ären .
possibly they hunt them sleeping animals or pat@@ rol on the basis of the ice sea and are looking for Kad@@ aver , from higher water slides after bottom .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or S@@ val@@ b@@ ard as an interest from the depth of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cm long , while the largest 502 of cm measured .
to determine the age of animals , they analyzed the lens core of the Ha@@ ie with the carbon @-@ 14 method .
this center of the eye lens is already constructed before the birth of the shar@@ ks , which were not renewed in it later .
the two smallest shar@@ ks showed a lot of carbon @-@ 14 in the lens .
their birth should therefore lie down to the early 1960s , as nuclear tests attempts to reduce larger quantities of this radio@@ active carbon in the atmosphere .
in the length of 220 centimeters in length , the third smallest animal contained the lens core contained a low surplus of carbon @-@ 14 out of the atomic fact that it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012 .
all major Greenland cells had normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts , which arises from cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ clock was shown for a 4@@ 93 centi@@ meter long Greenland , an age of 335 years , while the record @-@ shar@@ k with 502 centimeters is likely to be 392 years old .
that Grön@@ land@@ hai @-@ females only then get offspring , when they are longer than four meters , was well known .
now the researchers found the length of an age .
as one of the animals with 392 centimeters , probably at the threshold of the sexually mature and his age at 156 years was determined , Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie can be found at least one and a half centuries .
also this is likely to be the world record .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ ism live primarily in icy waters , is no co@@ incidence .
also the previous record holder , a 211 @-@ year old Greenland , a 120 year old har@@ po@@ em tip , was caught on Alaska in front of Alaska .
at low temperatures , the organ@@ ism also runs the living animals on the Spar@@ fl@@ ames there .
so you mature later - and al@@ arms slow .
to keep warm in cold water , the animals are often very large .
because it grows much faster than its surface due to the animal heat .
the heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much bigger than with a gram of elephant .
another advantage : you have less enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so a smaller beast lives more dangerous and should focus on themselves , as soon as many generations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Evol@@ u@@ tion@@ bi@@ ologist Sch@@ eu@@ er@@ lein . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a very big animal ought to invest his resources rather into a long life .
construction industry in double pack
with themes around the building , the community in the most recent session will be affected .
with relief , the committee took the notification of Mayor Robert plaster on that &quot; finally the marketing of the recently designated residential area can begin . &quot;
after the bound@@ ary of land , par@@ zel@@ li@@ cles and closing applications , the sale of land in the residential areas of road and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( sphere of Bin@@ der@@ straße - construction phase 1 ) could not be found to interested in any way interested in the way .
the community is convinced that the b@@ lows in the rural and quiet residential community beauti@@ es young families and equi@@ pping seniors equally to speak .
as it was called , construction consent can be held immediately in the City Hall , on the awarding of the par@@ c@@ els is expected to be advised during his September session .
in order to find in@@ quiries regarding the res@@ ett@@ lement of further industrial enterprises , linked to the creation of work@@ places , the Municipal Council decided to change the municipal budget plan in part areas in the spring of this year .
in the area of sub @-@ term lar@@ n , there are two par@@ c@@ els in the area of state road 2@@ 112 in the area of Unter@@ tempor@@ lar@@ n .
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
the city on the Main river was in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxemburg , the best chances to leave London &apos;s jobs and companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt am most benef@@ ited from the Bre@@ x@@ it vote , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ elecom , Head of the Compet@@ ence Financial Markets and Real Estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is illegal to run money from London from financial transactions throughout the EU .

Clin@@ ics earn 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % Federal Government
Hill@@ ary Clinton released their tax statement for 2015 , which revealed a USD 10,@@ 75 million in the Democrats and her husband , a USD 10,@@ 75 million , and an effective Federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 , the Clin@@ ics earned USD 1 million for char@@ ities , mainly to Clinton Foundation ; the former President Bill Clinton achieved a USD 3 million in spe@@ ech@@ es ; the former Foreign Minister issued a monthly income of USD 3 million from the publishing house Simon &amp; Sch@@ uster for her book in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .

&quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to put standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; Clin@@ t Kamp@@ agn@@ enh@@ el@@ far announced in J@@ enni@@ fer Pal@@ mier@@ i in a position .
in a stark contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump hidden behind the wrong expul@@ sion and feedback on his previous promises to publish its tax statements .
it is common to release their tax statements for US presidential candidates , although they are not obliged by law .
Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have stated as a reason for his ref@@ usal to control the tax authorities .
&quot; they are on the train , &quot; Clin@@ t Election campaigns in Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , regarding the publication of the Presi@@ dential Council of Democrats .
on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , Tr@@ um@@ ps Special advis@@ ers , too CN@@ N , that he would not allow tr@@ ump to release something before the control tests are not completed .

Clinton already reli@@ es on the topic and released a video on the Internet on Friday , in the high @-@ level Rep@@ ublic@@ ans of Tr@@ ump ref@@ uses to release his tax statement .
on Thursday she said the topic even during a speech to the economy in Michigan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ref@@ uses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and to publish its tax statements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the multitude . &quot; &quot; &quot;
political ico has reported that Tr@@ ump has not paid for two years or only very little taxes , and an economic journalist for the New York Times quoted a number of tax collectors and tax advis@@ ors that could still be the case .
the Federal Government has become a theme in election campaign .
Clinton supports a regulation that is named after billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren buff@@ et that people would make the more than USD 1 million earn an tax rate of at least 30 % .

Jewish director broke the Berlin Hotel , because Israeli pres@@ election was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; Inv@@ itation - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots develops a press clock after he had betrayed the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin has no Israeli pres@@ election because there were Arab guests according to a staff . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Hol@@ oc@@ aust@@ documentary &quot; Shoah , sent his anger at the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by taking an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the country &apos;s country code list .
however , the country was not listed among the countries which can be accessed directly from the hotel room .
how is it in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany &apos;s capital , is possible that Israel eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol offers the opportunity to select Israel for an own call center .
after a statement , the director turned to the hotel reception .
the answer , which he received there , &quot; sho@@ cked him &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote .
the hotel stated that the measure was a &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
the reason that stood behind , dissolved in the director even more rage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the majority of our guests are Arab@@ s and they have asked that the pre @-@ selection is quoted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employees of Lanz@@ mann has been cited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ des @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; great confusion , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung .
we were horri@@ fied by this event and dis@@ bur@@ sed .
that is really very severe .
the fact that this has been added in Germany in exactly this hotel chain , is even larger dis@@ grace .
this requires no explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ministers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident has a fairly large reson@@ ance on the internet , which the people called the whole a sc@@ and@@ al .
some under@@ set the Kemp@@ inski Hotel , that it had been given the inn@@ acle of Arabic guests . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be ashamed of you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was stated in another post which is noted that the hotel is located on the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , near a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly pointed all the alleg@@ ations of themselves and called the incident &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , &quot; Der Spiegel reported . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct order , &quot; Israel did not record into the quick voting list , &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung benef@@ ited a spokes@@ man of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel .
it adds that the country code has been added .
police reli@@ es Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as &amp; Gum@@ mig@@ ra@@ de against Protestant Brazilian students
students embar@@ ked on Thursday in the Brazilian city Sao Paulo with the police , when they gathered themselves to demonstrate against the re@@ forms of government for the public education system .
the police captured Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and Gum@@ mig@@ ra@@ de against demonstr@@ ators .
the difficulties began to act as a police officer , which led to the students that the police captured Gum@@ mig@@ ra@@ de and Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as .
several hundred students took part in the demonstrations to express their confirmation via the plans .
according to the proposals for the govern@@ ors of Sao Paulo Ger@@ al@@ do Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools will be closed , while 300,000 students are implemented to save money .
some of the participants have seen Gra@@ ff@@ it@@ its against the provisional President of Michel Tem@@ er on walls .
the most recent protests occurred some days after demonstr@@ ators went to the streets to support the suspended Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been taken up by a vote of the Senate on her ab@@ normal@@ ities from the office .
trade between Russia and Iran suddenly rising to 71 % - RT business
with the repe@@ al of the sanctions , according to the Russian Ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trading period between Moscow and Teheran in the year comparison rose by 7@@ 0.9 percent .
since the international sanctions were lifted against Iran , the interest in Russian companies grew shar@@ ply to shops in the country , divided the ambassador .
Russian companies have access to Iran , while new companies are ready to provide access to the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , another trading construction is one of the biggest priorities of the bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noted that the trade rate between Russia and Iran in the first five months of the year 2016 decreased by 7@@ 0.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , the Russian imports increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
the trading margin was achieved by deliveries of machines , vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the ambassador .
D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan goes out for this year from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
last year , the Russian foreign representatives visited about 35,000 Vis@@ as , primarily the route of Reis@@ ev@@ is@@ as , to Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran also reached the top 20 of the countries , which concerns the number of places in Russia .
it could say that the record figures of Irish tourists in Russia could be broken from the last year , he said .
at the same time , only a few Russians visit Iran , something from which the ambassador hopes that it will change .
&quot; I personally can recommend the visit of the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , who received the monuments of the old Persian civil@@ ization in good condition , &quot; he said .
we are looking for : beverage market in Wald@@ br@@ oil
a rob@@ ber@@ y is practic@@ ed on Thursday evening on the beverage market of Re@@ we XXL at the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .

how much money was explo@@ ited , the police divi@@ des not .
the perpet@@ rator should have been between 1,@@ 60 and 1,@@ 70 meters , so relatively small .
the beverage market is directly accessible and bad on the parking deck of the Re@@ we market .
the perpet@@ rators have to be sc@@ anned to the direction of Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Way and from opposite to the parking garage nearby Sch@@ ot@@ ter@@ parking place with the silver colored car , possibly in the direction B 256 ( sleep ring ) .
those who have made a observ@@ ations at the facts ( about 19.@@ 45 p.m. ) may report in connection with the prem@@ ise , ur@@ gently need to report on the police .

Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgrims to the gate of mercy
the minist@@ rants from the sail@@ ors of Ey@@ oc@@ al @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the way on a four @-@ day Pil@@ gri@@ mage of Vill@@ ingen to Freiburg .
together they have to overcome four stages .
in order to over@@ pass the period until the next romantic pilgrimage of all Minist@@ rants in the period of two years , the Ober@@ minist@@ ran@@ ten@@ round of St. Anna has decided to prepare a multi @-@ day pilgrimage .
various pilgrimage targets was checked and we decided to join the Bish@@ ops of Freiburg , where this year the Mer@@ cy of Mer@@ cy was given a special mushroom goal in this year on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy in Münster .
16 Min@@ is made of B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , Gru@@ ol , Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch and can@@ on@@ ers spread themselves on the way .
on the evening before he sent Stor@@ k the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , the fung@@ i crossed and divided the pilgrimage .
from Hor@@ b a train was driven by rail to the starting point of Vill@@ ingen , where a Münster was born and so the Pil@@ gri@@ mage was taken away from Münster .
the individual day tours were radi@@ ated in the morning and in the evening by a short im@@ pulse with different prayers , songs and let@@ ts .
but on the way the Min@@ is made to the cross , chap@@ els or churches always again to sing together a song from the lyrics of the pilgrims .
for the overnight stays the past@@ ures of the local parish were available .
Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller prepared for a sav@@ our@@ ing dinner as well as stronger dinner and breakfast .
on the second day it went on Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
tags on the road to St. Peter , who had the str@@ en@@ ue trail , had to be lowered about 500 meters of altitude , and once again would be climbed once again .
the reward was a common barbecue in the evening at the Bad@@ anas in the evening .
after dawn on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the impos@@ ing monastery church of St. Peter , it went to Freiburg on the final stage of Freiburg .
the Min@@ is met in Münster in the late afternoon of the Frei@@ burger Münster in the late afternoon and passed the gates of mercy .
with a small im@@ pulse , God was ab@@ dic@@ ated here .
at the evening mass in Münster we welcomed the Pil@@ gri@@ mage Min@@ is by Ko@@ operator Markus O@@ bert .
after the divine service , pilgrims came to the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar .
the next day was time for the Bre@@ is@@ gau@@ metrop@@ ole .
in the afternoon we went back to Hor@@ b .
at the end there were all participants that the days of spiritu@@ ality and a strong joint experience were min@@ ded .
Sch@@ otte Call@@ um Sk@@ inner stor@@ ms to home , when Br@@ it &apos;s gold for cycling .
from Scotland Call@@ um Sk@@ inner &apos;s last evening in the male team @-@ spr@@ int in Rio to fame , when the British Team def@@ ended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the An@@ ke role , who had made his landing of Sir Chris Ho@@ y . the J@@ ing and made the legend proud to enter a victory of favour@@ ites from favorites New Zealand .
four years ago , England claimed a sho@@ cking victory while Ho@@ y took the fifth of six Olympi@@ ol@@ d@@ med@@ ail@@ len .
they repeated the trick , after they took place in March at the railway World Championships in London despite the back of Ho@@ ys just a modest sixth place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the substitute for Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as an execution .
Ho@@ ys retired a gap that tried to close K@@ ian Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ ampton .
Sk@@ inner was the man who stayed at which she stayed when they saw the potential in the s@@ ots , which is now un@@ folded .
Hin@@ der , Kenn@@ y - who won four years ago with Ho@@ y and Sk@@ inner placed an Olympi@@ ad lap in the qualification round , but in the standing round the New Zealand took place in the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
Hin@@ der was just returned after his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team to the front and Sk@@ inner .
a strategic change made a large part of transformation from , with the Hin@@ der in a higher gear , to slow it down to slow it and especially Sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y saw from his position as a BBC expert from and fell Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des , when they were on the podium .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best to do and make me a name .
we set up a Olympi@@ ad ord in the final round and defeated the World Champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win .
after the triumph in 2012 on the page Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys there was the way that he fell down to the railway at a weak start .
he returned this statement later and there was no obj@@ ection of England Ri@@ vals .
for such an outstanding victory there was no problem this time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It feels like all the UK flagship to the Tri@@ bun@@ e as London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we joined the team in the last three months .
we are so bad at so many world tit@@ els so bad@@ ly away that it was incredible again at the Olympi@@ ad .
this is an event that won a gold medal for the Nation , who won seven of 10 titles both in Beijing and London .
if that is a barometer of our progress in the last five months , we expect successful five days at the bicycle stream .
with the form of labels it is in the field of possible that he repeated the Ho@@ ys victory of three Olympic gold medals in a contest .
that would be exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was born on March 23 ( a apparently holy date for British sport ; on which day , Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal .
the cage of Ho@@ y equals .
Kenn@@ y will take part in the Sprint , which starts today and will go over three days .
the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; I enjoy this just for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels anything to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he won two other gold medals , he should be defeated by the K@@ nights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only medal competition for the day , but there were other news for England .
Sir Bra@@ ke W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll quali@@ fies with the fastest performance in the four @-@ four @-@ kilometre race .
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 942 .
the world record , won in London in 2012 , was 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 659 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will be held on the second day of the contest , in which W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on safety .
he had fought yesterday with evidence before the qualification , when the func@@ tion@@ aries had called , to measure his height .
in the appe@@ aling women &apos;s competition , tomorrow continued and finished , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Bar@@ ker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ av@@ ie in world record time at 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the GB team is leaving on his strong railway team to domin@@ ate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a shame to medals .
after a truly outstanding representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio was launched .
it &apos;s down in the background , the re@@ sign@@ ation of the Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton &apos;s re@@ sign@@ ation in April in the midst of Sex@@ y and mo@@ b@@ b@@ ing@@ ents as well as the retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria P@@ end@@ leton .
however , if one sees the first evening of the competition at the Vel@@ o@@ drome , it looks quite soon after that the legendary reputation of GB@@ S , who has reached the perfect moment to become a perfect moment .
melting of the melting of Portland , based on the abol@@ ition of the energy contract
the future of the aluminium mel@@ ts of Portland , Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ places of workers - stand on the game , since the plant operator will termin@@ ate the energy supply contract and thus over@@ take all delivery contracts such as the supplier of energy companies .
this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsi@@ dies on operation of the plant .
a payout of 20 years from the payout runs in November .
up to 2,000 jobs in the plant of AL@@ CO@@ A in Portland .
no less than 2000 work@@ stations -@@ direct and indirect - could be threatened with closure .
in addition , it could come to Domin@@ ic effects , as the melting system uses around 10 percent of the whole power generation of Vict@@ ori@@ as .
in 2014 AL@@ CO@@ A closed the Point Henry melt , which led last year to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant .
the melt of AL@@ CO@@ A in Portland pays money and ris@@ ked up a closure .
this step follows the lon@@ gl@@ ary spec@@ ulation regarding the future of the system , initially as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the electricity price for the system .
AG@@ L , which makes the large aluminum melting with his Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , distributed that three further owners will termin@@ ate their contracts .
the plant is in the majority of a joint venture by AL@@ CO@@ A and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p will hold smaller shares .
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant continues to be operated in Portland , which means another physical demand for electricity by the melting of water , &quot; divided the company .
AG@@ L said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; securing transactions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shall continue to be in force as of November 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contracts have a 12 month period of notice that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hence , AG@@ L assumes that contracts for the fiscal year 17 will contribute to the revenue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the supplier supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impact on the revenues in AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong terminal markets for wholesale electricity prices .
AG@@ L shared that it had already written the value of contracts at its annual financial statements in the amount of $ 187 million in &quot; anticip@@ ation of a cancellation . &quot;
AL@@ CO@@ A said that the decision to book the tre@@ aties , the &quot; Sk@@ ill Al@@ co@@ as ... the sm@@ ooth@@ paste or the power supply to the melting point is not imp@@ aired . &quot;
the U.S. company said that it has concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , who had to have entered into effect from November this year , even if there is another explanation , why it is returned from the contract .
analysis of analysis due to the poor economic conditions of the industry before the possible closure of the Portland melting centre in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near Newcastle .
in reference to the statements of analy@@ st at the beginning of the week , Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Portland generates about 600 megawatts and Tom@@ ago generates approximately 900 megawatts of electricity per year .
if both plants disappear from the market , this would mean considerable reduction in demand on the &#91; current market &#93; .
and for us as a generating sets it would not be good , &quot; he said .
more than just one Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality @-@ TV @-@ Star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September edition of the Vog@@ ue
K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the Man@@ ag@@ erin and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ enner C@@ lan@@ s Kr@@ is is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September edition of the US Vog@@ ue .
K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der , joined the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced the news on her inst@@ ag@@ ram account on Thursday .
&quot; in a room of people that I love , the sight of this Co@@ vers wrote to the weeping , &quot; wrote K@@ end@@ all .
the unveil@@ ing of the Co@@ vers followed a bizar@@ re ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an family that shows the entire kar@@ aoke player and producer of Ke@@ eping Up Ry@@ an Se@@ ac@@ rest ) , as she is the cover of her sister and ends with a classic turn : they all have a surprise art@@ y .
this is the cl@@ ee@@ ee@@ zed action nearly every birthday party ( Se@@ ac@@ nant brought the sentence , &quot; You noticed that we would have forgotten you ? , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a animation on a broadcasting station at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kr@@ is had to participate in this public@@ ity .
with regard to the September edition of the Vog@@ ue , the Vog@@ ue has started a new era of kar@@ y@@ hi@@ ans .
K@@ end@@ alls big sister Kim likes her , beaten up the Vog@@ ue Cover ( she and her husband Kan@@ ye West were on it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself .
the September edition is the most popular edition of the year for Vog@@ ue .
with a circumference that resem@@ bles a photo band as a fashion magazine , the edition attrac@@ ts a large number of advertis@@ ements ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista , on the 8@@ 32 pages of the Bear@@ ings 615 pages advertisement ) .
the unveil@@ ing of his co@@ ater stars is expected to see that in the last two years , pictures of the magazine still dis@@ counted before the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover , include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Moss .
in recent years , more &quot; celebr@@ ities , the Mod@@ ules , &quot; known as &quot; Models , the celebr@@ ities are &quot; on the Cover .
Oscar lau@@ re@@ ate and Di@@ or brand ambassador J@@ enni@@ fer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor .
but even at the low chance that Mrs. J@@ enner - described by the magazine as the &quot; passage model &quot; of its generation , is described under the previous category , is located in good company .
these celebr@@ ities are not related to famous people or reality Stars or young people from today , know how to move a good snap@@ chat video ( even if everything related to J@@ enner ) .
they are really talented women who draw up in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of her career .
of course J@@ enn@@ ers don &apos;t like success everyone .
with its reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ ant &apos;s position was always a little bit stra@@ ined in the fashion world .
in June critic@@ ised the last Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ Modell Steph@@ anie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ enner and her colleagues in Gig@@ i H@@ adi@@ d and called them &quot; the mist@@ ak@@ age of the eyes . &quot;
this feelings mo@@ cked up again when the message was released with the release J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vog@@ ue Cover .
but on the way to reverse it seems to be attached to the point .
K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner is on the cover of the Vog@@ ue edition .
she is in the true sense of the word a super model .
she runs for Marc Jacobs .
it makes advertising for your footprint of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der .
you and all their sisters sell your pictures from themselves on their respective Pay@@ wall apps .
you sold pictures of Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds &apos;s daughter to the LO@@ VE magazine .
and in their leisure time they can see in reality TV . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
community @-@ centres annually 16@@ 0,000 people per year
more than 16@@ 0,000 of the help of the country are rejected every year by the community @-@ centres , while the industry accounts for the effects of another middle recent transactions .
in Que@@ ens@@ land there are already three of five people - mostly elderly persons , immig@@ rants , helpful workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ real del@@ og@@ ations and similar ones - looking for free legal couns@@ elling and legal information .
legal services of the commune , which are already fully util@@ ized , are ready for further cuts .
as of June next year , this legal centers will lose another 30 percent of their federal states .
the Director of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rel@@ l , said that the last survey of the National association of community @-@ centres revealed that thousands of people are rejected every year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Far@@ rel@@ l said that the situation without a repe@@ aling of the Federal Government would only be worse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land municipal centres are chronic , which means thousands of people of major services which you need to be denied . &quot; he said .
people who leave violent relationships , people with un@@ mist@@ ak@@ able and impressive debt , families who have been dismissed by separ@@ ations , workers , the od@@ f@@ ters were released - all these people have problems right and this collection shows that they don &apos;t need the help you need .
the Federal Government will cut by 30 percent as of June 2017 , meaning that thousands of helpful people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to be forced to justi@@ fy their legal problems with their legal problems .
we require the General Prosecutor and the Federal Minister of Justice and Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis , to re@@ plen@@ ish this middle class , so that people need help to maintain legal problems .
last year , the state government filled their promise to raise funds to the national average .
it is now at the time to view the needs of the community centers and of their customer communities as well as the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k invests in these important work .

Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
E @-@ Mail and Internet in periods : 20 years ago the Nokia Communic@@ ator came to the market .
the successor today domin@@ ate the world - its manufacturers experienced a disaster .
the device weighed almost half a kg and was heavy as hard as an iPhone 5 .
it was th@@ icker and bigger , it was therefore not good in the hand .
on the contrary , it was pretty kno@@ cked .
the built @-@ in memory amounted to eight Meg@@ abytes , which would be enough for about two sel@@ ections with high resolution .
an iPhone is now shipping to at least 16 gig@@ abytes .
the &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; arrived exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , in the business and it was the first smartphone .
for a few euros lovers can buy the devices still in the internet , but they come somehow out of the Stone Age of the Internet .
however , 20 years ago , the Communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone producer had announced the product a couple of months before C@@ eb@@ it &apos;s computer trade show in Hanover , Germany .
in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent and received a quantity : SMS and e @-@ mails sent , also by fax it was the Communic@@ ator .
even the access to our web site was possible via HTML browser if it slowly slowly .
a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be opened similar to a laptop .
then a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen found .
rather proud was the price : 2700 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 euros .
the average selling price of a smart phone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015 .
nobody was able to get the communic@@ ator of the start of the smartphone era in August 1996 .
since then everything is different .
the wise phones are a success story if not for Nokia .
the cell phone card of the Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented des@@ aster , was finally sold to Microsoft .
the market today rule the market , which all of them came to Nokia .
always online and everywhere , this is today for a lot of people in everyday life .
in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide .
about 1.4 billion devices have been sold , on Samsung and Apple alone is 555 million pieces .
worldwide sales of the equipment is around 400 billion euros .
the well @-@ running shops of the countless app @-@ provider and t@@ elecommun@@ ication are coming .
around the smartphone is a whole industry in the meantime .
the decisive breakthrough towards the mass market was first arrived at the beginning of 2007 , then Apple CEO Steve Jobs at the Mac @-@ World launched the introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones .
he spoke three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an internet communication , easy to use with touch screen .
the winner of the Apple began , still today the iPhone is the most important product of the group .
Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market , had the offspring .
they finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the scales now have Apple and Asian suppliers such as Samsung .
the smartphone is a self @-@ understanding for 20 years after its invention .
in the average , each German has now viewed 88 times a day on his mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to learn all the smartphone &apos;s smartphone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , in the Siemens Board of Personal Information . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must expand the Olympic spirit and bro@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row is not only going to be in our local municipalities and throughout London , but in all the country renewal and prosper@@ ity .
for me , it was the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ rows , just as in 2012 in London , when we had a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benef@@ ited from the games .
the Olympi@@ ad brought great benefits for Strat@@ ford and the East End .
and we will be able to achieve new possibilities for local firms and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
for our local communities we are already able to create 10,000 new jobs , 40,000 new jobs and youth unemployment in the airport environment .
as they were ahead of London in 2012 , there will be such that the challenge of the extension of He@@ ath@@ rows are too big .
I was said that England will never be ready for the games and we will be bl@@ am@@ inate us on the world stage .
the two @-@ fl@@ ers in 2012 are wrong and they are also wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to over@@ coming , but He@@ ath@@ row answers any question .
like the Olympic Games , He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for individual infrastructure project .
extension is an option to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 bn on funny growth and leave a legacy of skills and employment both to the airport as well as in all UK .
we have chosen a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has implemented a total of £ 11 billion in time and budget , from T5 - the five @-@ year @-@ row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , which was built in the middle of the two frequencies from the world .
now they are ready to supply a third drive , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment .
the London Games of 2012 were a great success for UK and I &apos;m confident that the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row is also one of them .
it is time that we expand this Olympic spirit and help He@@ ath@@ row and create our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that can be proud of England .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ atz @-@ and Maus@@ oleum &quot; &quot; &quot;
for companies who earn money with online advertising , according to one of the software manufacturers attempts to handle sco@@ ot@@ ation , a &quot; Kat@@ z@@ - and mouse game . &quot;
on Thursday , just two days after Facebook , Ad@@ block Plus would block a blo@@ g@@ post on its desktop page , in which it is possible that users may update their filters in the program to block advertising in the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook with that his des@@ kt@@ op@@ page would change the coding regarding his advertis@@ ements related to advertising , which is part of advertis@@ ements , which is part of the site advertising .
but Ad@@ block announced that there has been a new way to handle the new codes .
in a blo@@ g@@ post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her struggle between the cur@@ b@@ ating Open Source Community and the det@@ ours already since the invention of sco@@ ot@@ ers in G@@ ange , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest company has lost social media in the fight , is a powerful indi@@ z that has become a remarkable display of the industry .
according to a study conducted by Pa@@ is@@ air and Adobe , some 200 million people are lo@@ op@@ ted , almost four times so much in 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion a day of active users , access@@ ing Facebook on their mobile devices , hand@@ y@@ value 84 per cent of the valu@@ ations took advantage of fac@@ eb@@ ooks .
the company has no effect on display block@@ ers , since mobile display block@@ ers have no effect on fac@@ eb@@ ooks mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ ag@@ ram , shared a speaker .
advertisement on desktop PCs makes a sufficient amount of revenue , so Facebook will be the investment of such stri@@ de as worthwhile .
on Tuesday , Facebook with that it would update its &quot; ad @-@ reference tool &quot; to have more control over them on it .
on Thursday , Facebook that Ad@@ block would include new filters , because they would like to block content on the side , which are no advertising .
&quot; for the user does not constitute a positive experience , therefore we plan to discuss the problem &quot; spokes@@ person on Facebook in an e @-@ mail communication . &quot;
display block@@ ers are a dum@@ b means , why we focus on developers such as Ad pre@@ ferences instead , to maintain more control into the hands of the people .
woman with suspected suicide on Swiss Highway
the victim was in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police call witnesses after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday with an assumed self @-@ murder of several vehicles on a highway .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
a woman placed in the Dun@@ kl@@ en &quot; in a act of desp@@ air &quot; on the street and were taken by several cars , the police captured in Vau@@ d .
it is obvious that a Swiss , at the age of 49 , which was over@@ taking by several vehicles , including a lor@@ ry , would have to kill himself .
she died on site .
several drivers have already been taken , but some are still not identified , the police , those , as well as witnesses of the incident , were asked to report .
an investigation procedure was opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter , Le Tri@@ bun@@ e de Gen@@ eve .
however , it remains waiting for whether one of the driver will be displayed .
was a coll@@ ision avoid@@ able ?
this is something that the prosec@@ utor must decide , &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter .
two similar cases in the last five years show that the driver will not be moved to responsibility .
in each of the two cases - when a person ran in the Dun@@ cl@@ en on the fre@@ eway - was decided that motor@@ ists do not need to go out at the middle of the night , as it was called in the newspaper .
last year , a polic@@ ew@@ om@@ ist was acquitted of negli@@ gence after having killed a man and killed one night on the A1 in the near of Pay@@ erne in August 2014 .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victims had drunk , and became conscious of the streets .
the court found that the polic@@ ew@@ ays -- which had answered on an emergency call -- on a justified manner , and that the presence of a man on the road was a &quot; entirely extraordinary and fore@@ se@@ eable situation , &quot; said the judge .
everyone who has further information about the incident happened on Thursday near Morges , should report to the police at number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA Klim@@ am@@ od@@ ell : Venus was once inhab@@ itable
the Venus was according to the proj@@ ections of a new NASA climate model probably once inhab@@ itable .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus and algorith@@ ms that are similar to those of climate research .
the model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere once deposited with similar conditions .
scientists previously pointed out that the slow revolution of Venus could be explained by its density of atmosphere .
but the latest simulation indicates that Venus had a thin but similar atmosphere could have had , and still slowly turned .
the model was illuminated by the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet probably demonstrated more dry places than the earth , but had once enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to host life and protected from faster evap@@ oration .
the early Venus also benef@@ ited from a sun that was 30 percent matter .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow revolution of Venus had exp@@ on@@ ated its daily side of the sun almost two months , &quot; explained G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release .
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer of clouds , which works as a rain@@ maker to par@@ ach@@ ute the surface of a large sun heat .
the result are average temperatures that are some degree cooler than those of the earth today .
the model brought a story of the Venus that resem@@ bles Evolution which was previously assumed by Plan@@ etary Research .
although they were presumably inhab@@ itable to Venus , the Venus was exposed in the course of several billion years of --@@ too much heat and ultra@@ violet light .
their oceans evap@@ or@@ ated and its water vap@@ or was burned down by ultra@@ violet light .
when the hydro@@ gen was removed only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a dead@@ ly greenhouse effect - Venus , which know how we know it today .
the researchers distributed the results of their new Venus climate model in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Letters .
Patrick Roy enters as a trainer of the Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy came back on Thursday as a trainer and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che home and led to an under@@ stand@@ able co @-@ determination in the team &apos;s decision @-@ making process .
alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will be looking immediately after a new coach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last three years I have met my duties as principal coach and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations of Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and destination , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy played in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the course of summer long and much about thinking about how I could improve this team to give it more depth , this is needed and to bring it to a higher level .
to achieve this , the vision of the Train@@ ers and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations is perfectly suited to the organization .
he must also have a determination of decisions to influence the performance of the team .
these conditions are currently not fulfilled .
Sak@@ ic , who had begun Roy on May 23 , 2013 , came to him for his contributions to his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick has informed me today about this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we all appreciate all that he did for our organisation and wish him just the best for the future .
Roy &apos;s winner was awarded as the winner of the Jack Adam Awards during his debut season at the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the league .
he introduced the association to 112 points and on the first place in the Central Vision , but Colorado was beaten in the first round of Play@@ offs of Minnesota and missed the night season in each of the last two years .
the Aval@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the game for a second Wild@@ card spot in the Western Conference around five points .
as Hall of Fame Tor@@ wart , Roy won four Stanley C@@ ups -- two pieces with Montreal Can@@ adi@@ ens and the Aval@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ öl@@ workers take convers@@ ations up , put strike from
the strug@@ gles for the re@@ mun@@ eration for North @-@ oil workers are exposed , while all disp@@ utes parties for a new talk round at the table were negoti@@ ating .
strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group were carried out spor@@ adi@@ cally on platforms at the North Sea , which are operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; Wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and W@@ mt trade unions can confirm that we re@@ united to the winding process of the present battle , &quot; says it in a joint statement .
we will hold some full @-@ day meetings in the next weeks , beginning to start the beginning of next year to rest@@ art the problems .
the unions said that their last strike , who is the first in over 25 years is a protest against possible wage loss of up to 30 percent .
this year , Wood Group has shortened the rates to its contra@@ sts in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s ratings follows a 10 percent reduction for on@@ shore Con@@ tractor in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts of the company gives the required space to come across the market down@@ turn .
Shell has released for its part of people from people and plans to susp@@ end his oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries , since its business activities are rati@@ onal@@ ised as a result of its meg@@ az@@ us@@ ations with the UK energy company BG Group .
energy companies are due to the lower raw materials under pressure , an economic situation that forced to leave the European Union by the decision of the British in June .
the Scottish parliament Dave Anderson met at the beginning of this week with workers to discuss one of the greatest work of labour which took place since a generation in the North Sea .
the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need a economy that works for many and not only for a few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , there are less than $ 1.4 billion on expenditure for new projects in the North Sea , compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the past five years .
Kepler measures rot@@ ational rate of stars in the constellation of Ple@@ j@@ ades
the newest mission with the Kepler space teles@@ cope has helped the most complete catalogue on rot@@ ational rates among stars in the star of Ple@@ y@@ ades .
the new data help the astronom@@ ers are to understand why stars are rotating in the constellation as well as in which connection the rot@@ ational periods are standing with the planet .
&quot; we hope we hope through the same of our results with other star@@ ry , more about the relationship between the mass of a dying , his age and even the history of its solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at C@@ alt@@ ech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the constellation of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades is located 445 light years away from the Earth .
many stars in this constellation , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , reach adul@@ th@@ ood .
they are now on the fastest .
to top rot@@ ational rates , these mature stars are coming to star winds .
as these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars .
when a star alter@@ t , its rot@@ ational rate begins to slow down .
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by taking the time between the appearance of a recogni@@ z@@ able star spot -- as solar spot -- recogni@@ zes .
the latest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates shows that massive stars are slower than less massive stars .
re@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , 4 stars slower pi@@ rou@@ ets than smaller ones .
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors that tend to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors to be able to be very bright stars , &quot; said V@@ ull .
since the constellation of the Ple@@ j@@ ades are so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare pitches such as rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; the constellation of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades provides an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said V@@ ull .
it &apos;s still a lot to hear what we would like to know more about how , When and Why , your rot@@ ational rates slow down and so tell their &quot; dance shoes . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and their colleagues have reported in detail about their latest analysis of rotation rates of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades , which will be published soon in the astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversi@@ al bas@@ eball Star enters
tears run at Alex Rodri@@ guez faster than the US Bas@@ eball Star in the best days of Base Base Base .
after its emotional return announcement , the 41 year @-@ old pro will take place on 12 August against the T@@ amp@@ a Bay R@@ ays a last time the tri@@ bal of his New York Y@@ an@@ ke@@ es .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &apos; Good@@ b@@ ye &apos; to the &apos; , declared the 14 @-@ times All @-@ Star Game Particip@@ ants of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) .
three times Rodri@@ guez was elected the most valuable player of the League , in 2009 he won the Y@@ an@@ ke@@ es the World Series .
his signature under one tenth year contract signed him 27 million US dollars annually since 2007 .
until the end of the contrast , December 31 , 2017 , he will serve as an advisor and youth coach - with full salary .
as a player , Rodri@@ guez paid long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Nav@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 @-@ 2004 ) and since 2005 he managed to have some mil@@ estones .
with the Hall @-@ of @-@ Fame members H@@ ank Aaron and Willi@@ e M@@ ays have only two more bas@@ eball players in the most important statistics similar values .
but the 41 @-@ year @-@ old still does not have to be included in the glory of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls .
for so successful Rodri@@ guez - Spitz@@ name &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; - on the field was so controversi@@ al is his appearance outside the place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already in 2009 , the super@@ star at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; issued a ster@@ oids between 2001 and 2003 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August 2013 , he was closed due to a settlement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis @-@ Sk@@ and@@ al until the end of 2014 for 211 games .
Rodri@@ guez is considered to have the main susp@@ ect for many years , over an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida to obtain funding funds .
after a legal dispute the sperm was reduced to 162 encoun@@ ters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the league could even have had a pleasure for 2014 , because I played 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ guez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his f@@ arewell days are not dis@@ ap@@ pointing .
while many bas@@ eball Legends in their last games still won the great stage , Rodri@@ guez is often sitting on the bank .
&quot; my job contains no f@@ arewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job includes the attempt to win any game , &quot; Y@@ an@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ard@@ i .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want a @-@ Rod &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; che@@ eks for the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ guez team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Olympia 2016 : Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are the first d@@ op@@ ing@@ cases
because of a positive D@@ op@@ ing@@ sample , the weigh@@ t@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Target could not start from Poland in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Games are covered by the first official dos@@ ages .
an experienced athl@@ ete won almost a medal .
before the seventh race day , the first official D@@ op@@ ing@@ cases had become known for the Rio de Janeiro &apos;s Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
the Chinese swim in Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter @-@ obst@@ acle in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa from Bulgaria and the Polish weight @-@ weigh@@ t@@ ber Adrian Ziel@@ inski have been positi@@ vely tested and excluded - immediately before the start of the successful athlet@@ ics competitions this news about un@@ time .
at Ch@@ en , the dioc@@ ese of hydro@@ chlor@@ o@@ thi@@ azi@@ de has been proved to be used as a m@@ asked agent for d@@ op@@ ing@@ sub@@ distances .
the International Sport@@ Court CA@@ S confirmed its expul@@ sion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon .
on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old took place in the final place in the final about 100 m Butterfly , only about 0.09 seconds they missed the bronze medal .
on Friday , Ch@@ en would have to participate in the pen@@ alties of about 50 m Freestyle .
Ch@@ en has requested the opening of the B @-@ Trial Chamber of the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) in the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) .
the national association take the matter &quot; very serious and demands of Ch@@ en full cooperation in the investigations , &quot; quoted X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; we will work with the International Sport@@ al@@ shof CA@@ S and will accept the verdict . &quot;
for the first time in history , the IOC is not the IOC but the CA@@ S responsible for the san@@ ction of the sports@@ men with positive cases .
also in the night of Rio , the news about the positive test at Dan@@ ek@@ owa , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went away to the offensive .
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my four test was positive , &quot; this was &quot; an incredible shock , &quot; she said the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be nutritional supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared the female athlet@@ ics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report it is said to act with the banned substance to the EP@@ O blood d@@ oping control .
Dan@@ ek@@ owa has been suspended as a provisional basis , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ sample is already positive .
Bulgaria became Prime Minister Bo@@ jko Bor@@ is@@ sow , with criticism of the ath@@ om@@ ic of Ath@@ ena .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes cannot draw the right sli@@ ps , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &apos;re Bulg@@ arians under observation , so many are already excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
about all weigh@@ t@@ lif@@ ters from the chronic d@@ op@@ ing@@ ed nation must not be able to participate in Rio .
the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; was also known as the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg , like his brother Tom@@ as@@ z was tested for three days previously positive on the an@@ ab@@ ole ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ rol@@ on .
both compete , both are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg .
before the start of the athl@@ ete , Dan@@ ek@@ owa is particularly difficult for the rep@@ lication of the whole sports art .
the world association IA@@ AF had the entire Russian crew to start to an exception because of systematic d@@ op@@ ings , which also produces le@@ asing Kenya in Rio , numerous bad news .
in the swimming sport , former insur@@ ers in China had also ensured for severe strug@@ gles between athletes .
so the Fr@@ ench@@ man Camil@@ le Lac@@ our@@ t wrote the Chinese Olympic Champion Sun Yang har@@ sch .
&quot; sun Yang p@@ ink@@ elt l@@ ila . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I see the podium over 200 m Freestyle I will pass through , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was also facing the center of a meditation with the Australian M@@ ack H@@ ort@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for d@@ oping bedding , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was positive in 2014 with the Chinese nationals positi@@ vely tested for the vote of tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din but had to sit only a three @-@ month spar@@ row .
datashe@@ et : so per@@ fi@@ de ra@@ pper h@@ ack@@ ers her rans@@ om
programm@@ ers of comp@@ ress@@ ungs @-@ malware are currently targeted companies - and they are successful .
according to a recent survey of the malware f@@ le specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes under 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of surveyed firms surveyed have at least once , partly several victims of a attack with press@@ er software .
in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies have already aim to achieve a R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware processing .
40 percent of the victims were will@@ ingly will@@ ingly will@@ ingly offered by the perpet@@ rators to use the challenged systems and data .
the perpet@@ rators specialized their comp@@ ress@@ er software according to the observ@@ ations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes to attacks in corporate networks .
if they are successful there , the potential to er@@ ti@@ cking rans@@ om allowance considerably higher than in private use .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we observe a troubled fast evolution of pollutants , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes @-@ boss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ z@@ yn@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; world &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2008 most Mal@@ war@@ e@@ programs have been designed to send an advertisement .
then discovered the perpet@@ rator software for themselves .
only private users were the goal , but the transition to the st@@ ats were made during the last months of the last months .
R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware is working according to a simple pattern : once upon the computer of a sacrifice , they search specifically after un@@ long changed files like Word@@ - , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files as well as to archives of pictures and videos .
these files are encrypted using R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als .
then the software presents the requirements of the comp@@ ress@@ er .
in order to get the final turn@@ key code to the files , the sacrifice must generally pay money - usually in the form of Cr@@ yp@@ ton Bit@@ coin .
but where the personal use of personal use is the personal photo database on the game , it is related to companies to sensitive customer data or project databases without which the production is shut down .
accordingly , the damage falls off , if a R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware does not beat .
22 per cent of the German companies reported revenues losses by R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware , 13 per cent , even the business activities had to fall complete , in case of a human being .
in Germany , several hospitals were killed by attacks , whose patients may be threatened by the loss of patient acute disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always say to the victims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t pay , you only promotes the problem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ z@@ yn@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay , get their data again .
the manager is difficult for managers in view of the perpet@@ rators in the operation of the perpet@@ rators .
the h@@ acker again know this and try to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , the safety for@@ scher of F @-@ Secure exam@@ ines the user areas and contact with the comp@@ ress@@ ors and come to the result : the perpet@@ rators are actually trying to set a kind of customer service to take more money .
they tell their victims by chat as they can pay by bit@@ coin , freely accessible support sites , or de@@ cryp@@ t free example files .
and will be saved individuals after payments of a few hundred Euros , companies have to pay part of negoti@@ ate and five @-@ digit sum@@ s to rep@@ lic@@ ate their data .
in view of the potential high and relatively risk win@@ nings from the R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware processing , the h@@ acker will always share professional and share the work , explains security professionals Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski , by the Internet provider SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write a R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware around within a week . &quot;
more likely is it that it is about three or four people .

the risk of R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware is now known for many companies that make their data better .
more than 50 percent of companies @-@ IT processors have trusted in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes @-@ survey , R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware by using file @-@ back @-@ ups and scans software .
&quot; &quot; &quot; accordingly , the perpet@@ rators have already pursue new strategies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if the encryption of data alone is no sufficient thre@@ ats for successful path@@ ogen , the perpet@@ rators , instead , with the release of sensitive data such as customer lists or pri@@ mand@@ ations , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes @-@ boss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ z@@ yn@@ ski .
this makes the damage potential according to type of data even more multiple than before .

Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and easy @-@ to @-@ proof
in the small HR @-@ V Honda will un@@ pack everything : a little SUV , a little coupé and even the versat@@ ility of a mini@@ v@@ ans .
sounds pretty much , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform , like the new jazz , is indeed very flexible in everyday life .
although only 1,@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V rather small , the passengers have a lot of space both in the first row as well as in the barrel .
the materials of the inner space are well processed and work comfortable , only the cockpit of the cockpit is somewhat above .
the HR @-@ V is more versatile than comparable vehicles .
it is not just a boot storage of 453 l at high and 10@@ 26 l when folded back tail@@ rests , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot;
that is less magic , as it sounds : the seat areas of the rear bench can be folded like Kin@@ os@@ essel and offer the storage space , which is 1.5 m high from the floor to the ceilings 1.@@ 24 m high .
the boot space can be loaded well , however , the load height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR @-@ V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
however , he is likely to teach his job .
the daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is gr@@ ati@@ fying .
there is another engine capability : a 1.5 @-@ liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the behaviour is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
but the steering should be somewhat direct .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the equipment can be opened in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; model &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the City @-@ emergency braking system is one of the security systems ( works at a speed of 32 ) , the coll@@ isions system and trace assistant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; coll@@ isions @-@ war@@ ner &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes because he evaluated many obstacles as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her@@ ann@@ ing objects &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
very reliably works the remote assist@@ ent .
and the smart speed controller respon@@ ds to traffic sign and thr@@ ott@@ le when needed the speed .
however , the full connectivity is only available for the top @-@ configuration : 7 @-@ inch touchscreen , Nav@@ i , App Integration and more .
two USB@@ - and an HDMI socket lay down under the arm@@ rest and therefore are therefore a little bit hard to reach .
the approximately 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top @-@ Diesel are fine .
who doesn &apos;t want to invest much as much , the gasoline is available from 20,000 euros , the diesel starting from 23@@ 000 Euro .
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emissions standard .
the HR @-@ V offers Honda a versatile and everyday driving car .
Airline do not adher@@ es : fall to air@@ lift
a airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the air@@ crafts .
because a liability is only possible for d@@ angers which are typical for air traffic , argu@@ ed the Higher Regional Court in Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) .
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs had broken down with the fall of a kne@@ e kne@@ e .
the accident would however never happen everywhere - it is handy for a common life of life , so the dish .
the airline had to pay no compensation in the man .
sick@@ ness : when paid the organizer
if you have been travelling in the hotel after their journey , pay money back when the cause of the disease is to be free in the hotel .
but this is just the case if more than ten percent of the guests proven the same symptoms .
in the negoti@@ ated case a family was difficult to decline in the second day of their tur@@ qu@@ ake cancer .
she spent nearly the whole holiday in the room .
their disease led the tourists on a def@@ ective se@@ wage plant , which supp@@ os@@ edly cont@@ am@@ inated the sea@@ water .
the family was the view , the journey would have been man@@ ned and def@@ endants against the promot@@ er .
before court , the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs had no success .
although the cl@@ ause was def@@ ective .
but the promot@@ er knew just before departure of the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs .
he had to go up until then that the sea was fine .
he did not viol@@ ate his information , so the verdict .
no contamination were found in the samples of the water .
the disease of several hotel guests - bl@@ ur@@ red by pressing one another - are the general life of life .
there were only 38 people from 6@@ 91 guests .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère said after the violence committed violence in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people are wor@@ ried about further attacks .
the state had to be so@@ ber and decided to react to terror at the same time .
safe is : our land will not answer violence against hat@@ red and split .
we won &apos;t get the terror@@ ists .
when criminal off@@ ences would have to leave the country , however , the safety and strength is also the approval of the population for the refugee policy .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère wants to achieve a implementation of the proposals by the German Bundestag election in 2017 .
he also announced another personal rein@@ forcement of security forces , namely , &quot; in medium @-@ order size orders for more than several years . &quot;
sympath@@ y advertising for terrorism must be under punishment .
video surveillance should be improved , the ce@@ ase@@ fire is so nov@@ ert that especially the purchase of weapons will be added in the internet .
the most recently discussed silence light for doctors will remain en@@ su@@ ed according to de Mai@@ zi@@ ères words .
however , in dialogue with the medical shaft , he wants to search for solutions how the threat of citizens could be reduced , he said with a view of psych@@ ic cap@@ tions .
in order to meet a radic@@ alization of refugees , the Minister holds a better social responsibility for necessary .
teachers have to be better prepared on handling with trau@@ mat@@ ised people .
for the prosecution of crimin@@ als in special areas of the Internet ( Dar@@ k@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère plans to use investig@@ ator investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD boss Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything , to increase security further . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is important that the Interior Minister declared clearly against action against action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a lot for the hin@@ ge in the CDU / CS@@ U &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Gabriel told the newspapers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fun@@ ke Medi@@ ated group ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;

better traffic flow on the fre@@ eway
it &apos;s regularly on the surrounding road - here a picture of November .
but this is supposed to change : the legal ab@@ bi@@ dity should be extended .
this is a good news for all the car drivers who stand in the professional traffic on the ambient road every evening in the St@@ au where you drive through the highway Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
road construction is extended to the next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) between the Hammer Street and the Wes@@ eler Road , the road lin@@ ers lane is 700 metres away .
drive on the right next to the hammer on the right .
the big advantage : the traffic will share early on how the total funding is improved on the most distinguished section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CDU faction in the district of Münster @-@ West .
the ground@@ breaking on the ro@@ ar nerv@@ es the driver especially between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
on week@@ days , the back@@ au stretches back to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ her path and sometimes also beyond .
the reason is the needle &apos;s clock to the B 51 just before the departure of Wes@@ eler .
from here the traffic only runs directly over the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be built well in the thirty @-@ quarter years ago .
the reason : static calculations had revealed that the bridge does not have the necessary load capacity to absorb the heavy duty of heavy traffic .
as long as this bott@@ len@@ eck and the associated ste@@ ad@@ orian st@@ ats , the responsible state is not able to say .
however , it is expected to calculate with years : for the bridge has an official remaining time until 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the legal ab@@ bi@@ dity , the state @-@ of @-@ operation has chosen the traffic weaker time in school holidays because with disabilities .
the traffic will run on Tuesday and Wednesday by Wednesday at the construction site .
intercultural journey : cultural offers for schools
the international class of Wald@@ schule visited the theatre piece &quot; The invisible House . &quot;
the association N@@ IMA &apos;s and the Young theatre plan now plan a musical project .
the association N@@ IMA &apos;s allows young people with mig@@ rat@@ ory and refugee reasons to visit cultural institutions in Münster .

in the context of the association N@@ IMA &apos;s initiated &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey , &quot; 19 students from eleven to 15 years visited the st@@ aging in the little house .
since the beginning of the year , the association , which has set the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee reasons , schools have the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project .
most of the students of the class were born between September 2015 and March 2016 among others , Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria , and had little German .
thanks to the chore@@ ograph@@ ies , the scen@@ ic pictures and video activities it was possible to follow the action @-@ course , so the press release of the Young Theatre Münster .

rain instead of stars : hope of weather approach
the weather has made the constellation in the South@@ west of Germany in the South@@ west of Germany at the night to Friday a station through the bill - but there is still hope .
the night is bad for clouds and rain was bad@@ ly suitable for the sky spect@@ acle , the chair of the ob@@ servatory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , said on Friday morning .
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather should be good , then we see a lot of stars in the sky .
in the constellation are Per@@ ei@@ den who belong to the fastest constellation with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour .
they have their names , because they apparently come from the constellation Per@@ se@@ us , which is in the northeast .
relaxing night : tips against sleeping disorders
in the evening , one will be around for ever , at night you can sleep hours in the morning , and in the morning there is no longer thinking about sleep .
that &apos;s all others as a relaxing .
after all , one is with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , approximately one quarter of adults had sleep disorders and more than ten percent you can find their sleep often or permanently as non @-@ relaxing .
how are sleeping difficulties or sleep disorders ?
there are several forms of sleep disorders , and it can under@@ lying them many causes , emphas@@ ises Hans @-@ Günter We@@ e@@ ß , member of the German Society for Sle@@ ev@@ ing and Sle@@ ep Medicine .
what you think about it is , however , the in@@ som@@ nia is never so an input and sleep distur@@ b@@ ance .
just the play@@ ful people can find many people as harm@@ less or in@@ adequate , Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , member of the German house medical association with practice in Lower Saxony .
what &apos;s behind sleeping disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
inter alia , organic , psychological or un@@ conditional factors , but also contains medicines .
not rare is the sleep distur@@ b expression of another disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early awak@@ ening is often frequent in depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says We@@ e@@ ß . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that different factors may need to each other .
who , for example , has a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , can be bad , w@@ akes every two to three hours and begins to gre@@ asy on everyday problems and effort , gives We@@ e@@ ß an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should I do with sleep disorders ?
who doesn &apos;t sleep over a month in at least three nights per week and imp@@ aired on the day should go to the doctor , ask We@@ e@@ ß .
the impair@@ ment can look completely different : one is beaten , tired , un@@ le@@ aked , has difficulties with the attention and the concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical complaints like stomach or head@@ aches .
to bend the sleep distur@@ b , it is important to find their causes .
as treatment options , behavi@@ our@@ al changes , a cogn@@ itive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or medic@@ ations - classic sleep tablets only in exceptional cases and a maximum for two weeks - in@@ quire .
in Germany there is hardly ever under@@ lines Prof. Ingo Fi@@ etze , head of the inter@@ disciplinary @-@ medical centre of the Char@@ ité University Hospital Berlin in Germany .
that is why one should first turn to sleep problems at the hom@@ e@@ alog@@ ist , then We@@ e@@ ß .
it may clari@@ fy , if the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to the sleep , and what happens there ?
for the investigation in the laboratory @-@ laboratory , for example , in mu@@ ff@@ ing with respiratory diseases , in case of illness , or if you don &apos;t find the cause of a break @-@ distur@@ b , explains Fi@@ etze .
you do not have to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; only please make no lunch , &quot; says Fi@@ bre .
after glu@@ ing , one gets into the bed at its normal time .
in addition to the electrodes the body it carries a nose g@@ og@@ gles , chest strap and a sensor on the finger .
the camera also features a camera on the ceiling to the sleeping .
how can suffer@@ ers get the problems in the handle ?
there are fairly many positions on which one can set for a better sleep .
We@@ e@@ ß counts on : regular sleep and standing times , not too long in bed , do not sleep to sleep , alcohol abst@@ ain from and at night not to the clock - then we begin to expect at once and that &apos;s all and not able to transport .
what makes the jung@@ le camp with missing medals in swimming
the former German S@@ wimm@@ ers Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has sold the dis@@ ap@@ pointing cutting of the DS@@ V team at the Olympic is sold by Facebook .
in December 2014 , he took the first world record for the first time in Doha at the same time .
now the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ let Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has been protected by Facebook in front of his critic@@ ized ex @-@ team@@ work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a country where the Olympic champion gains 20,000 € reward and a jung@@ le kö@@ nig . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody wanted to wonder about lack of medals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old in the night on his Facebook page . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conveyor system in swimming sport is bad , the D@@ oping control is very good .
so we can &apos;t compete with countries that do very much support and do not want to watch or even operate at the subject of d@@ oping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls are set to be set &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he stated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he wanted to start a com@@ eback to have to be reported in nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( NA@@ DA ) .
it is necessary to keep it with countries .

airport : Ban@@ de von Bag@@ gage were arrested
professional Di@@ th@@ iev@@ es at Düsseldorf Airport
civil servants of the Düssel@@ dor@@ fer Police managed on Thursday the arrest of two women and two men at the age of 50 to 61 years .
the facts alleged as Ban@@ de several pocket and luggage pil@@ es were committed .
at 21.@@ 30 o &apos;clock civil servants recognized in Düsseldorf at the airport Düsseldorf Airport , which was known to the polic@@ emen from past theft .
the two women and two men had committed several crimes committed during the middle of July and were responsible for a collective , working part , and especially professional .
the specialists in the crimin@@ al@@ thi@@ ther@@ net 34 can meet the di@@ alog@@ s that went up to Germany for the destruction of criminal off@@ ences in Germany .
they took over 15,000 euro in total .
old buildings , a few Lin@@ den@@ baths , in between still a rest head pav@@ ement : the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain works on the first sight , but the police counts it to the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
if you go along the east to the west , you come to play , a refresh@@ ed kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ades .
on the façade of a grey house someone has &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; spra@@ yed .
opposite to a Li@@ dl that will soon be demolished , it is already built : by 2017 there will be a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments .
article about this &quot; trendy district , &quot; as the competent real estate company Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain , are described in the last weeks but preferred with burning cars .
reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , now the inhabitants of hire , on the ground floor are still rooms occupied and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , in particular , in the beginning of the year , he had been responsible for a tough incident of the police against the project &quot; No @-@ Go @-@ Zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and 94 as a starting point of autonomous violence .
after 22 June the rooms were vac@@ ated on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schm@@ ie@@ de , with 300 police officers , the police arrested three weeks prior to official statements , with 30 to 40 civil servants and three car cars on site , locked parts of the road and kept visitor to enter the house with the number 94 .
meanwhile , renovated building workers on behalf of unknown house@@ owner the rooms .
on 13 July , a Berlin administrative court decided that the clearance had been illegal , and a day later he moved police and workers under the Ju@@ bel of sympath@@ izers and residents .
in this summer afternoon the road acts peace@@ fully : parents go with children , sit on the brush before the houses in the sun , others maintain vor@@ m sp@@ ät@@ i .
a primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens are in close proximity to the hood projects .
left violence is not the main or@@ acle of many others : K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in the p@@ ines since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who attrac@@ ts three children , are above all of the police presence .
with the residents of the skin projects , they share care of rising and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
it doesn &apos;t sound to a pine , who wish to get more comfortable police protection from v@@ and@@ al@@ ating left .
the tr@@ ench , which the Berlin inn@@ ens@@ ator and the police make up between domestic and their neighbours , does not exist so obvious .
Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain in the East of Berlin actually was a traditional workers &apos; quarter that even today compared to the rest of the city a lower average income and high risk of poverty .
also home @-@ occupied residential projects are already long to the pine trees : in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including almost the entire main@@ z street near the Rig@@ a@@ er .
while the Main@@ zer had been vac@@ ated among large police officers , many of the projects were leg@@ alized within the Rig@@ a@@ er and are still inhabited by people , which they occupied by the people 26 years ago .
at the same time , the neighborhood has become increasingly becoming mag@@ nets for tourists and election liner from around the world : with them , residents from GDR times and former house occupied their p@@ ines .
this is also noticeable in rentals , which has risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009 .
many of the new buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as symbols for this development : they det@@ ects them or fresh@@ ly coated fac@@ ades , that have been rejected with colour wra@@ ps .
no other street was often mentioned this year together with the words &quot; left @-@ autonomous violence . &quot;
a reason for that , not all the neighbours must have this as a problem that they are not affected by the crimin@@ ality not affected : off@@ ences such as body injuries , statistics are almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
the largest part of the offen@@ ders make non@@ sense that tend to meet the new buildings and newly renovated houses .
for K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives for 17 years in a rental house next to the controversi@@ al 94 , cannot be any speech by un@@ certainty .
what violence goes , it is important : the people in the 94 are their neigh@@ bors who have not been dest@@ ined .
also the famous burning cars will give it right in the Rig@@ a@@ er no longer .
for which she studied Archit@@ ect@@ in , her street is no criminal law , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps each other , lives together on the street and gets more of one another with what is different . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is deliber@@ ately drawn into the Rig@@ a@@ er street - stayed and stayed .
that &apos;s why it was so important that the residents got up their street : from the police , politics and the media that all inv@@ oked the De@@ ut@@ hall on the district in July .
but in the eyes of residents such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the street will continue to be taken away : new items in former building blocks that are excav@@ ated in old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , the con@@ domin@@ iums , which are not interesting for many here - here is more people who are not so good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; violence and destruction can I not have gu@@ th@@ ei@@ rs . &quot;
but what should you do if any one listen to someone ?
since all sides are fru@@ stration among all sides , also in the police and the inhabitants .
for jobs that were over paint bombs , K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the skin projects and the left scene belonged to the p@@ ines .
who attrac@@ ts , should be aware of it - exactly like a man who is in a p@@ addle quarter , can be po@@ or@@ ly compl@@ ain about noise .
all those only with pre @-@ mentioned persons have asked to be called not named with their correct name
Ur@@ bach : An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ ver@@ le is a new refugee camp
An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person in terms of integration and organis@@ ational .
in addition , it is a social worker .
since July , An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ ver@@ le has been the refugee for Ur@@ bach .
social ped@@ agog@@ ue support the team of management at Ach@@ im Gro@@ z@@ berger .
it looks as a contact person for all stak@@ eholders : refugees , working group assistance , authorities , authorities , and anyone else .
Reg@@ ine customer stipul@@ ates that it is a volunte@@ er more than than@@ k@@ bar that Deu@@ ver@@ le now is , the har@@ sh wo@@ k that has a problem .
so some - less sp@@ icy than rather than the multitude of un@@ w@@ ishing tasks are targeted - meant when the administration wanted to write the place .
we wanted a management force with a talent for languages and people , associated with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , just a har@@ sh wo@@ k .
but administration is not their central area , An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ ver@@ le .
above all , it is about organization , work with people on site and also behind the scenes as well as network activity .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been in existence for approximately six weeks .
she has received a 50 percent position on three years .
&quot; it was the highest time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer that An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ ver@@ le Hon@@ or and Public actors supported .
there are large and small issues , organiz@@ ational , human and understanding problems .
soon new containers are located in the washer street
it has been a serious problem since some time , the apartments have been recognized for the pl@@ ough@@ s that have been recognized .
the commun@@ es are responsible for the connection of the connection .
they must accom@@ o@@ date the refugees in their own or rented rooms .
the costs for the construction , the rent or renovation of this accommodation must bear the municipalities itself .
the responsibility changes from Land@@ rat@@ ory and job centre .
problem : there are free objects , but not each owner will offer his apartment .
the search have been very difficult for some time .
de fac@@ to finds no private apartments .
it didn &apos;t work until now , if you were interested in private apartments so Deu@@ ver@@ le .
therefore , common ground must be inf@@ am@@ ous as it is so beautiful .
so soon , new containers are set up in the washer street .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the key@@ word , are ra@@ ins and An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ ver@@ le .
in addition to a fixed lead , there are practitioners , training places , training places , one @-@ euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants who have to be found or arranged .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reported Reg@@ ine customer .
many work in the building yard or help house master , complete non@@ profit work - and motiv@@ ated and very ti@@ dy , as An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
it hopes that the work will lead to a positive external effect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no employment therapy &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he does not only mean work .
the day require a fixed structure , say Deu@@ ver@@ le and customer .
people need to develop a im@@ perme@@ ability .
so do offers quot@@ ations like sports , contacts with local and especially language courses .
professional courses are ra@@ r .
so here &apos;s administration and honour .
it is centrally located that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
they have to explain the refugees that it takes about time to get the time of sense , for example , with language courses .
anyone who would like to make sense , he could not work in Ur@@ bach , do not work , and be un@@ profitable , who will never integrate .
the distinct majority is motiv@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , problems are hon@@ est , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people , at which nothing goes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the work of Deu@@ ver@@ t and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mamm@@ oth task &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a difficult question : did the two after the recent inci@@ dents afraid of radic@@ alization , also in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what man@@ cher can call it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but a residual risk of it could not be missed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sen@@ si@@ p@@ iti@@ zes the hel@@ per yet .
these inci@@ dents were also theme in the refugees .
they would have the fear that the ma@@ ke@@ epers will bring them completely in order .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer .
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so we have to look at the main and amb@@ ition from the location , and in the region after activities .
they always have in the background that a new press to refugees and migrants may come to Ur@@ bach in the background .
needs Germany a upper limit ?
the policy is clear to answer this question .
actually , it is un@@ fair to set the hel@@ pers on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we arrived not there where we would like , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ ver@@ le . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no new refugees , that would relax .
Reg@@ ine client also makes clear that the ur@@ b@@ acher could already be le@@ ached to integrate existing people .
these are currently around 100 people , mainly young men .
but when people in distress they have to help them , both women have one .
the political world situation is so complicated , there is no simple answers .
