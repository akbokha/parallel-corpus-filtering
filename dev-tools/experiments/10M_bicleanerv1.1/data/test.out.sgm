<seg id="1">Clint and Trumps Economic Policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">In infrastructure and the trade agreement TTP - we want to prevent Clinton as well as trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two US presidential elections however, however, are among the tax and energy policy as well as in a basic query.</seg>
<seg id="4">The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a basic, rather philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">The role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep the doubt rather small and warns to damage like the state of economy - with taxes and regulators.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton would regulate the economy to death and to death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">Himself, he would be different, claims Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">He will return to massively massively, and he makes himself strong tax reform with lower tax movements strong - for private professionals and businesses.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton says: the state has certain tasks to meet and needs disadvantaged opportunities and needs money.</seg>
<seg id="11">Therefore, taxes for the rich would have increased, says it.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the subject of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">It must be invested in the must, say Trump and Clinton nearly equal.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic applicants announces even the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes for the infrastructure are classical democratic politics and are rejected by the state-ritical Teachy wings of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So on Trump, so there could be more common discussions.</seg>
<seg id="17">Significant are the differences in energy and climate policies.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal power plants and restore coal promotion in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil promotion should also be possible in so far protected areas to announce the Paris Climate Protection Agreement.</seg>
<seg id="20">Clinton wants to strengthen its investment program to enhance renewable energies and demands: "a country will create the superpower of clean energies and create millions jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will be either China, Germany or America - I want to be it."</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only with the infrastructure - also at international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the polite fish trade agreements, do not want to sign up.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, both the US do not want to isolate the international trade - but simply protect the American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">They should also be paid better, calls for Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7,25 US dollars is a hunger strike.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "what is to do in this question is not clear: once he says," "" "he says," "" "he says," "" "he says he shall not be changed." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="29">But the great discussion of the coming months is likely to develop the control policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">On one page is Trump, who wants to escape the economy and citizens to spur growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics keep him before, so the budget deficit would only be bigger.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton who wants to ask at least from the rich who wants to pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution.</seg>

<seg id="25">In their home, they have experience with sexual violence, forced to see Honor of Honor, slavery, or forced prostitution.</seg>
<seg id="26">That drives it off.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the escape the way goes.</seg>

<seg id="30">Who think that as soon as they are ankets in Germany, irre, tells Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="31">Too, there were often women in refugee quotas often as minderine and worse.</seg>
<seg id="32">This leads to that approximately 90 percent of women who live in the accommodation in the Munich north, it is estimated that they are.</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children are certainly not voluntary."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are so usual that they say nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "or they don't trust, openly about the earth, because the shame is too big." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an alliance of outer lateral "?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended up a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give the hands and to announce an official end of eight months in the war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counterplayer in the gilded hall of St. Petersburg Palastes in receiving, I cannot assume that Ankara wants to do this reconciliation on most of them.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the hand, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putins smiles worked narrowly, and he did not shine warmth, even for his return conditions.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand," "" "Putin - according to his" "" "friend" "" "Putin - according to a report about five times." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">I could not count it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but even to improve even better.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day described a newspaper that Erdogan would have been on the same day when it would never be a little bit.</seg>
<seg id="11">To me, his enthusiasm seemed rather the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin-radiating, sustainable cooling revealed that the State of Russia had nothing forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of crisis was the first thing that he mentioned in his introductory words: the surplus of a Russian fighter aircraft in the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow from response to time was wutiliated.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin was divided and accused Ankara to have fallen in the back.</seg>
<seg id="16">It even was even bigger, since it was committed by a true friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Vetropes will be rebuild again if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">The public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the state-controlled media led a severe, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">When it seemed to be, the Turks would bear the debt for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">On serious, the allegations of conductive officials reported that Erdogans had benefited from illegal oil trading in the areas of Syria, which will be controlled by the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He denied this vehement.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting took place just because Putin received the excuse of the President Erdogan, who wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire is clear on the hand.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan is primarily associated with all friends who can get to last month after a failed coup d'etat of his amtes.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey had also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic pictures.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions hit the Turkey hard - in particular the ban of batches, each year usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, travel operators and batch companies will be facilitated if the flights will be resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late aisonal anonslaught of the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, the state-of-state television budget fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again.</seg>
<seg id="35">A report in Vedemosti formulated it in this way: "tourists lived there for long, tomatoes here."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara has risen to the West, since the response to the tried power was considered a weak answer.</seg>
<seg id="38">In addition, the persistent Groll come to the EU acceding negotiations and Putin - the piping on it, from the cool atmosphere, and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the west.</seg>
<seg id="39">In Ankara, the Russian State of State won a bonus that he asked for the attempted coup d "état for the chosen state of State.</seg>
<seg id="40">That's prosperous for Moscow is a self-understandable, which itself has a deep fear of regiming.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit meeting in this glittering palace of the sea enabled Russia and Turkey, one, as it was an analyst once described, "Alliance of outer lateral": two countries, which are cast off from the west and worried and now banned.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still large differences between both the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow had recently restored the role as a peace treason, but where Russia and Turkey support mutual websites.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be a record that after nearly three hours on first discussions both President on the press conference said that they had not even had the subject.</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey admied it on a question about their differences, while Putin decided to pray these too.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no unique consensus about it, where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster when the NATO member of Turkey enjoyed the Russian martial jet - it is certainly better to talk about two Heads of State at least again.</seg>

<seg id="5">In a position of the Kremlin it is that Putin without specifying reasons "the release Ivanovs of his duties as chairman of the Russian presidiary administration."</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who joined Ivanovs deputy, has been appointed to his successor since 2012.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 1972 in the Estonian capital of Tallinn, he made his degree at the renowned Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in Tokyo in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the site of the Kremlin it is called (in Russian) that he was later protocol manager and Office leader of the government sonals.</seg>
<seg id="10">He said to Putin: "thank you for your trust."</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "I think it is the most important role of the government to support your activity as state leader in regard to law and checks to implement your instructions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his position and recommended to Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convince the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made secrets Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov was a long time of time confidentially in Vladimir Putin and works as he for the Soviet secret service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff he was one of the most powerful men of the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin, broadcasted both men that the Chief of Staff was back on his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the harvest for the cameras, only a few of them are convinced - especially now, shortly before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">Is here the result of a kind of power?</seg>
<seg id="20">No one currently doesn't know.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official assertion - that a man who was once again recognized as a potential President, was to lead to Russian environmental policy - fell on big scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his comments on Putin, who are quoted on the site of the Kremlin, Ivanov said, "It is true that I have asked to trust this very complicated post in early 2012 - they could almost say to trust for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it came out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidiary for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">He was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin became a former member of the State Security Service KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), he was appointed KGB, Ivanov was appointed to his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov as one of five people, to whom he trusted in most.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once was assumed that Ivanov could become the second term of President of Russia, as a third term of putting into the Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another, nearby ally Putins, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became prime minister before he became President three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The SPD and Green: investors must be much stronger in the future.</seg>

<seg id="4">"" "the SPD proposes to the next advice meeting a" "" "Action concept" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="5">But dispute is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First line comes to the question: who is supposed to build an affordable apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">SPD vice-president Christoph Frmann said: "we are going to build us with the Greens: who wants to build urban areas have to be 20 percent of all apartments as a social dwellings."</seg>
<seg id="9">However, the cheap apartments can also be created in stock.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, the large armed point in the town hall was, however, as Bratmann: "how are you going to build private surfaces on private areas?"</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "we want to have investors on such surfaces at least 10 percent, but as possible to build 20 percent of the apartments as an independent apartments." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">A new municipal housing development program that will cost millions of costs and will still be financed, to incentives for incentives.</seg>
<seg id="13">The problem, so Bratmann: "there are currently no agreement between fractions."</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants to make investors as possible as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Linke wants to increase hardness levels for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Regardless of this, Bratmann, baked themselves a disappearance of the situation on the housing market.</seg>
<seg id="17">The concept concept is implemented, which provide additional tasks in the building administration.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is required.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the experts.</seg>
<seg id="20">Yet the program is not completely free: for the approximately 1260 new apartments that should be built in.</seg>
<seg id="21">But how do you compare the loss of another about 1300 affordable apartments, whose funding will run out in the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="22">It will be 500 apartments only by 2020.</seg>
<seg id="23">To prevent this, the planetary spokesperson in Nicole Palm, should now be bought out of the current ties of the city.</seg>
<seg id="24">Furthermore, it would have to be thought about to pick up the apartments again into the price.</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the West city.</seg>

<seg id="27">Because in the West city run at the end of Fristen.</seg>
<seg id="28">About 1800 apartments could get there back into the price of cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: we want the owners, the housing companies do not want.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness, worth it worth</seg>
<seg id="2">It's fascinating to see how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">That teenager and child could not go out more after outside, but rather you prefer to spend your free time, on screens, became in the last decade of many.</seg>
<seg id="4">At Pokemon Go, there is therefore to get people from the sofa and to be active.</seg>
<seg id="5">At the time the screen was at the beginning on TV, then to video games and last on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">Therefore it's great to see that technology and activities are not close to each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">I have made me of course at the Pokémon Go-Wahn, a app that were created on the characters used for the video games in the 1990s (later it created a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">How many phenomena of populations decreased slightly before the publication of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that overload the server.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days, Pokémon Go more users than Tinyms and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, players go out with their smartphones to the outside and search for Pokémons, which were followed with a GPS, once they were found, "photographed" (over a screenshot on the phone) or "can be taken captive."</seg>
<seg id="13">One generation that played the game when she was still younger, joined the course and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the US, the game led to a considerable increase in steps that determines the "average" person every day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardio, a app for Apple Watch, which persecuted 35,000 users, divided by the Washington Post recently, that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of people followed by 45 percent to 53 percent every day.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company doesn't know who plays Pokémon Go - it looks just the raw data to increase performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many public awareness campaigns to health, people want to bring in "30 minutes" to come "from the sofa" and "every day to be active," because many public messages are boring to health and people will look like that.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the meaning of sports cannot be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="19">Who regularly drives sports, reduces its opportunities to cross cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps with weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of advantages that can lead to them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful to Pokémon Go is that there is people to do something in the open, making them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people close to the hunt even new friends.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always there are mürrical gamers who must always complain about anything.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could walk against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What should it be?</seg>
<seg id="27">It is a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if you could follow smartphone apps like Fitbit earlier our activity, they gave us no reason to drive sport as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The New will lose its maturity and use it with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, because of the poker success, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activity will be unite in the real world and help many people on the hunt, active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie smote all the same way as Aly and Madison, to create it into the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">They are the "Last Five" because the next Olympiad will only have four gymnast inside the team. furthermore, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as trainee.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality looks like that Turnen is a expensive sport, and Turner at first line in private turnable, who will receive parents, competition, itineraries, competition and hotel costs (for the coach and their Turner and families). the list can be seen in any other.</seg>

<seg id="2">A British rice undergone his immune system and dignity of serious examination - by taking some of the most dirty and most common places of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The moderator and travel agent Ian Wright, 51, out of Suffolk will retire at a Euro Schein, a jelly on the Piccadilly Circus, a carcasserole of a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to make the resistance of its immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before leaving every object he used a Luminometer to show yourself and let us show what he is going to let.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment received under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprising results in daylight.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought to check the carcasserole of a train toilet, which was already used by thousands of others, may be completely impervious to imperate, but actually there are more bad bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria, as well as its own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately, nothing left, what he ableased, more than a bad retaste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright has been known to test the resistance of its gut, by which he travelled through the world, as well as wonderful things ate.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public funds to train stations until go to the crack of toilets, the task set up his immune system definitely under a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">In the film he said: "already as a child I was relatively unconcerned about what my health is concerned and I have set all possible things in my mouth, earth, worms and sludge."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he was just justified to his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing that he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His trial showed a Luminometres of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">In comparison, Luminometres is freshly washed hands less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet who refused to refuse after its Luminometres was over 4000 units while fresh hands have a few more than 60.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr Wright and the Finnish producer of dairy products valio produced the travel movie "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the bacteria number of different places like the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">In the film he says, "This is the worst, which I have turned in a toilet, close" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing dirt than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I'm not going on here because it is inside or inscribed here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in cooperation with the Finnish producer of dairy products valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company took Mr. Wright with valio Gefilus which contains both lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the support of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">Valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and New categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "we wanted to do something new.</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to watch and explains the benefits of Probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We brought crazy brainstorings through which we ended that we said "Let us call us Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that interest in health health will become a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of only about the products we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and poor bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of the intestinal health and how it is associated with the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">Growing interest in the intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to prepare more information on an interesting way for more information.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who led the direction of the film, added: "let me now tell my respect for Ian, when he had tried some of the things I have ordered him, like the Russian toilet, which is shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things where it was simple to bring Ian, to perform them, and others in which this was fairly difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "I'm glad that we recorded some of these dirty leakeries on film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by Valio survey conducted by 2015, 84 percent of all respondents of lactic acid bacteria, especially with the well-being of gastrointestinal bacteria, and 58 percent said that they contain at least occasionally products that include lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="2">Seltsames Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals get nothing from summer elections with - and holiday from North Rhine-Westphalia must not choose the country's day.</seg>
<seg id="3">They understood them in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="4">By 2021, the Parliament election will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays already decided at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">Because blöder than to date, it is not: summer holidays, heat and landing gear - that takes itself.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals that are convinced by the election campaign are on vacation.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most of the holidays that are in the country are on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not a native, so must not choose the country day.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are practical problems: in the holidays are helper, the posters hang up, air balloons, flyers and spread out at the end of the votes only.</seg>
<seg id="9">By September 4, 2016, the election and final day of the holiday day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to pass only a vote against the people over the people.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it is also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD / CDU Coalition, must fear his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, which is the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU.</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting, how strong Neuling AfD cuts and remains left at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 head of government, makes an almost unobtrusive campaign, you can see from his grandparents.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels across the country, distributed as roses, and plagued a little with the people, as it had already been legendary Harald Ringstorff's legendary predecessor.</seg>
<seg id="16">Otherwise, soul's cold feet have been received and are Chancellor Merkel the guilt on the blossom of the AfD.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "your refugee policy, you" "" "We will create the ascent of the right-wing lists, which is likely to cost him the beautiful office." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU with its top-edge data, the Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is if you want to enter the right place of election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="19">She has been invited twice in German Chancellor Angela Merkel; the Bundestag's Bundestag is located in the northeast.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target group did not vote, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berliner and Sachsen as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="21">"it was probably the majority of other federal states," accused Vincent coert, General Secretary of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in NDR.</seg>
<seg id="22">But there is no man to hear anything from other corners of Germany, Angela Merkel once again.</seg>
<seg id="23">Otherwise the north-east CDU goes largely to the usual electors in market areas and shopping malls with sun umbrellas and air balloons.</seg>
<seg id="24">This, that, cocades, plays only one "subordinate role."</seg>
<seg id="25">The Union also noted that you have the basis the base of the base, that it must be very strict to find a wire to the people.</seg>
<seg id="26">You are like the left, the SPD, the Green Party, hardly available in the times of the country.</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the Council of the CDU election fighting its Mitstreites, however, is also self-horrified: "you have to go where there is where men are: Dorffeste, Golden Weddings, every birthday party must be used."</seg>
<seg id="28">Because much in the game, Sellering has now called its SPD to a particularly committed election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In surveys, Socialists and Democrats last with 22 percent behind the CDU (25) and just under the AfD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">In the election of 2011, the SPD had won more than 35.6 percent before the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">The green, small party with seven percent in the surveys, should be able to create the jump into the country's day.</seg>
<seg id="32">They make a modern Tugend and put their election campaign large part to the internet.</seg>
<seg id="33">"online campaign" is called "online campaign Claudia Müller.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination records: who can buy sound plates?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men of middle age love records.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you come to the commentary part, in order to oversever him under the pseudonym-Alleak-Mittal-Mittal age with harsh Beleiving, this statement leads from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the most comprehensive recovery of sound plates do not want to look forward to a boom in millennials which will be welcomed by physical objects, but on Midlife Nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who have bought a sheet recently, are all advance, according to the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most likely population group.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a horden by Hobbies: older record players keep their feelings rather for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it alone to spend time (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog a news report in television would follow me when I carry out a modest street in Soho, a modest grey suit, before I steal, keep my hands and something best to say: "so let us take a closer look."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's throw a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even if the heart of SoHos is slow to his charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent seller were resident - there's how a handful of a handful record business.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the camera's camera to turn the camera for the next part, where I stand in close proximity to various men in such a shops and try to estimate their age and mixture through observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I register of Sister Ray (data number: eight men mean age) into the Reckless Records (data number: eight men mean age, a woman, probably around the 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess" I guess "he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4,000 sheets.</seg>
<seg id="17">This sound plates, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I am not followed him home), dress the walls of its residential rooms.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has such a sizable number of albums and singles, is the result of its available income: it is now able to buy records, which he appeared and buy items, which he sold, when he was young and pleite.</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy, are out of the late 60s, early 70s, who appeared when I was 11 or 12. things where I was probably a little to buy them," says he.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "he is true that those who buy plates, rather be missed, and add:" "" "I smoke not, and I drink not much." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my Laster.</seg>
<seg id="22">Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, believes that many customers that he meets the YouGov-profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, he also noticed a new wave to people who have influenced by the Medienhpe, people who have heard about the comeback to buy their old records again.</seg>
<seg id="24">Of the talks I have led, people usually have been leased to their collection in 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers that were once sold their records to buy CDs now, buy their CDs now, "says he.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom to trailers of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional importance of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a business like Phonica to realize that record business has a soothing community of equisites.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to Wez, some of the older client participated in the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans are overwhelmed from the digital world and want to draw back to the stability of familiar sound plate covers, of objects, happy bodies.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think, sometimes it can be the colt of a void or the possession of possession possessions as a kind of comfort," says Wez.</seg>
<seg id="32">That is with me as a collector so and I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal intellectual.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social worker!" "" "a staff of a record stack from a record stack." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey of the ICM included in April that nearly 50% of the people who have bought a record, they have not heard it.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey found that 41% have a record player who never use it, while 7% of those who buy a record, no turntable players have.</seg>
<seg id="37">At that time of the news report I would probably look very concerned, while I blushed by a stack to Bossa Nova Compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at sounds of the Universe (data number: three men mean age) has noticed a "trophy of the Revival."</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone came only recently here and said," I do not know a record player, but I would like to make it a radio record record, that I can set them into the shelf. "</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage but it happens definitely.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productive-load, less musiklasty.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I don't have a record player."</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older who come only slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp that has dedicated the sound boards almost a whole floor, has a blower audience, when I go.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around 70, tourists, the photos make, teagejungs and women mean age.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere has a little less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beasts neuester Synthesis and Sepacker Pop instead of experimental jazz is used from speakers - is it good to see such a diver of the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">No one of them looks strange, but nagant psychic traumata are hard to be fixed if you're going to take about 30 seconds next to someone.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been around since some minutes in the store and considered the Varietting of the slabs for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It's more a shoving mel than a big buy-off.</seg>
<seg id="50">They don't deserves much, therefore the collection of records is not real option, says it.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs much.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to listen to music from a computer or in other way, but the beauty of records is... "it drives with a pleasant sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how I declare it - it is really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a shop, of which is said that a new generation of record players will have inspired: urban outcerters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I give the ticket to count Jeans-Hotpants, I observe a group of young kids, before a father and his daughter is superior to buy a Crosley record players.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left is a staircase, a wall full of noble, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">No one sees her - maybe because they are only pure decorative, some so far from above that it is impossible to hold it.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "Disk".</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that each attraction for these objects would mean more money for the industry, and some customers can send to the depths of SoHos for more, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, also the one that is most suitable for luxury objects as plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even if my research results showed that the results of YouGov will vote, at least in record business in Soho, the large number of female collectors and record players exist in reality, sheet shops and online stores, untaken into account.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday morning with security not by record shops of the Berwick Street and the leaves through plates, while they starving the starring, 30-year-old Moderator, who resides his own husbands mean age, aged over the shoulders.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court has rejected an offer of authorities in Calais, dozens of provisory shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, in which thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">During a trial hearing these week argued the authorities in Calais, that the state should be authorised to sell 72 provisorical business, sell, hairdresser services or tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or easy meals for a few Euro in provisory restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Calais prefecture argued that these places should be broken down because they would be paid for a parallel economy, which would not be paid out of the tax and sanitation risk.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups divided the court with that the shops and restaurants are important, as the free meals are offered by the nationally supported Association and other groups, not enough food for growing numbers in stock.</seg>
<seg id="6">They led out that the provisional shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in distress.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who use 72 provisory shops, but dreamed that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais will be "absolutely comprehensible."</seg>
<seg id="8">The judge Jean-François Molla said that the food shops, cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger roll when they live only people who live "in extremely short conditions."</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas of quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers offer.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places that was threatened by the precipitation was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, the generalant and 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as an advice about asylum of protection, unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170,000 people signed the petition to preserve the kids' café.</seg>
<seg id="12">In a letter to the Guardian, it was that the closure "for those children of a disaster would be, of which the youngest eight years old are."</seg>
<seg id="13">The two auxiliary organisations Help Refugees and L'Auberge of Migrants estimated that the number of people increased to over 9,000 people - the highest number up to now - after a steep rise of newcommissions throughout the summer.</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive performance of Britain at the 7-er Rugby came in the finals on Thursday evening on an abrupt stop during the last hurdle in the form of Fijis, when they were beaten with a result of 43-7 at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji divided a master class in the handling, side-stepping, back-back, liner and raw strength to win gold - their first Olympiad for each color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was sunk by the silver medal of silver medal - Great Britain on that day - and they could definitely be proud of their efforts in this tournament, in which they struck New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The significant defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semifinals on the same day could fall back to them in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, Fiji would have defeated a 15-man team in the shape of this form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be for GB a consolation - but it's probably not - that at least one brite morning a gold medal at his neck: Fijis Head trainer Ben Ryan, the former boss of England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult way behind.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago she lost under Ryan every match among Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">They lost only one thing here.</seg>
<seg id="11">This cap is weaving, but the progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji began wonderful and left the attacks of GBS from spass.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for the captain Tom Mitchell on and Co. on, when one would run into driving buses. the World Series winner went up to 5-0 as the Osea Kolinisau in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With another four minutes of play, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner, which he walked.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB has hardly taken the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A hackle of Mitchell stops the mountain of Mann Leone Nakarawa a third goal but it has only stopped.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute Jasa Veremalua in the right corner a touch down and it stood 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new since the revival and there was still over a minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou prefeted by a further weak Tacklings of the GB teams and stormed up to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It's like that Fiji was born to play the 7, while the GB is still running.</seg>
<seg id="22">So it is also.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB introduced basic changes to the half-time and closed the fijiic gap... for a whole four minutes, what was good for the conditions of the first half time, until Joshua ran Tuisova according to a Brilliant intermediate play of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started a test for GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game was already long in favour of the South Sudan, whose fans sang and dance on the Tribune.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the game Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame set the i-bag with another attempt in the last seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Pfiff-önte, the fijis rearmed, and the GB should be smitten in the lawn.</seg>

<seg id="1">Helen Glover and Heather Stanning through fighting with the cancer of the trainer for rowing victory</seg>
<seg id="2">There will be no emotional gold than in these games and what will be called.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first rowing boat to the last, 220 hard Hieve go into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have found an additional significance in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even if there were only those who were sitting at the Ruder, there were three voices in the boat. the Echo of the trainer Robin Williams, was allotted to the second Olympiagold in the two without tax woman in a row, the first women in the history of British sports that laid it on a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their dominance was absolutely, after all her 39.ter unused use, which is also exemplary.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant Athletes, which reflects the surface with elegance of sponges, which does not reflect the species of the Arc de Triomphe.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in the Ruins, a battalion to consent to which make the difference, and it was no more helpful than the trainer, who would not survive the day before 30 months when he was diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said he risky what risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer, which is operable and they did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not do this, he spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a quite bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little to the view.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was lucky that he could begin treatment early in early 2014, outside the season, what the interruption could begin on a minimum, if this was the right term under such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, therefore I had to go better again soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was a incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in the hospital and ran on the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough.</seg>
<seg id="18">So it starts.</seg>
<seg id="19">The rowing is already a challenge, but this makes it too much bigger.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the uncertainty of the victory there went their first thoughts on Williams, who gave a little bit more than anything else and tried to handle his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">Stanning who was a captain in the Royal Artillery Regiment in Afghanistan, said "I was this week an emotional wreck. this is maybe something extremely, but it means so much."</seg>
<seg id="22">It would be repeated, how much I mean, how much I and Helen and also Robin worked.</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin, we are no one, therefore a massive Danke goes on him. he is the best coach in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I would have no better person for exercising or a better coach.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have lost no races in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The pair had a hard rhythm, with which their opponents could not be kept.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to close, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were astonished at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen called "lead in the process, lead in the process."</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important to rip off.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not able to make something Tolles.</seg>
<seg id="33">We wanted to do no fireworks, we wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race what we did.</seg>
<seg id="34">The pair will take out for a year before making decisions of his future.</seg>
<seg id="35">Glover has to appear next week on a wedding, their own with the TV adventurers Steve Backshall.</seg>
<seg id="36">Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.</seg>
<seg id="37">I didn't want to say that my last race was.</seg>
<seg id="38">That would have too much pressure.</seg>
<seg id="39">In London it took about six months to realize that I am a Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="40">It was all so new for me and I was so stressed.</seg>
<seg id="41">It took about four minutes.</seg>
<seg id="42">It feels so much better, "she said.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the midst of the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampolins</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are too late as late as it is, the Olympic Games are too late.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro feel permanently and unbalanced, a rapid relay between competition and streak.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is, as the Olympic torch itself would be a burning staff, which is removed from the wristwatch to the swimmers to the gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't turn off the television to listen to a newspaper or listen to your neighbours in the maintenance long in Coffeshop, without talking about Simone Biles, Katie Lecovery or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women with dimples, could definitely be sent under this known name, built on the Prime Time, built by sponsors and well-being TV advertising when he would be a swimmers, Turner or even Freal.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fighting in the Olympic trampolines by gold.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame is not lit every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the center, partly in the shade, the sports, which are not generally acknowledged: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, Taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the chest swimming and let it have long to rule.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I should make a modest arguments for my particular love, then let me make the attention on the discreet charm of the trampolins.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampolines have already been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, it became the last 16 years so many that I had asked, did not know that it is a Olympiasportart.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional Ignoranz.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA sent the competition for competition, it has never won a medal in the trampolintro and won an athlete up until 2012, who made it up to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to divide the prices for men and the Chinese, and Canadian women for women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennon from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampolinskip has a certain outer side charme, partly because it sounds for the unexplained ear for a clownsschule as well as for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point, I should admit that I am not an expert but only a duseless little enthusiasm.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorous potential - the cartographic citations of his never to end-walls - but also the Grazie of the turnaround and dive, which combines two sports, which are essentially unites.</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means so much means "jumping board."</seg>
<seg id="22">Emerging winner jump on a giant trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and need a number of falling movements (turning, hgenuine and saltos) before it lander on the feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">They will be evaluated according to the Official Olympic Games according to the execution, degree of difficulty and "flight time."</seg>
<seg id="24">Bikers offensive from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists must continue in their streches after gold, even faster, downwards and back, sometimes up to the finish, sometimes and back, downwards and downwards on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They do not chase the finish line or the output wall, but in the television transmission, also another cavity target: the world or the Olympiarship.</seg>
<seg id="28">The targeted streben is Nobel, admired, even fanatic - and it's enough to stir even a spectators to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I'm looking for watching this games as a little bit sensitive.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a break-break.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampolines is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or her prallt, seemingly heavy heavy like a astronaut, then goes down to the bottom, then effortlessly back up.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is also a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during practice there is no hectic attack on the target, no wolves in the distance, just the dreumeric, elegant lines of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It's so Zen like the competition at the Olympic Games only.</seg>
<seg id="36">The women's qualification and final round of women will take place on Friday afternoon, in the streaming of 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also around 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will expire as part of an afternoon block of 2 days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the middle of the Olympia Manie they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overseen in general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">When the consciousness can only be reached by the attacking and the objection of male athletes - how the male US Turner was recently marked with the The Wall Street Journal recently - then Mr. Dooley awaits its according to the air round, new fan community.</seg>

<seg id="4">Witnesses to say that only protest during clashes with the police were killed.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just together to break together?</seg>
<seg id="6">In the last ten years it was one of the most stable countries of Africa, a solid partnership with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But during the last months, protests against the government and far more territories were shaken.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week, thousands of people stormed the streets and requested fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The response of the government was inbarren according to human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses announced that policemen came to only unarmed demonstrators and killed.</seg>
<seg id="11">In circulation, the video about the protests, probably from the last or beginning of this year, show how security professionals beat young people with poles, while these were forced to make a handstand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Chief of the UN Security Council for Human Rights now demands an incoming investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it was always difficult to keep this country and future, it will even be more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populated country of Africa and its stability is estimated at the west.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence services closely collaborated with Ethiopians to fight terror across the region, in particular in Somalia. only few countries in Africa, when at all, get so much Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded in a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has drastically improved - there is a new commuter in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">The streets are generally quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if Ethiopia were all other than a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continued until the repression of the government - the opposition in the country was restricted by the opposition to silence.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or in prison, killed or put into the desert of the wilderness.</seg>

<seg id="24">A generation protesters.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints to cover everything from the floor up to the dignity in relation to the rule of the rain coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a broadly criticised election last year, the party and its allies received the final seat of the opposition, and now control 100 percent of the parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, tensions grow along the border to Eritrea; a fight for this zag, controversial line called for hundreds of lives.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analyst fears that separatists as the Oromo-Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, who were more or less enacted, the turbulences could be scourged in the last years.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of injuries after years is now explode under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in the last few years, many Ethiopian were able to communicate with the social media, as cheap smartphones were more common and improved the Internet services.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government shut up the access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do in regular intervals, especially with protests, many people can still communicate about Internet proxies, hide themselves where they keep themselves.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians gave that they gathered themselves together to protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there are more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two biggest Ethnic in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">Oromos and Amharas are no natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">Since equations prospered the Amharas, who come from apples, mainly Christian-countries, in politics and economy, while they were polluted to Oromos, of which many Muslims are and in flat land areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But that changes straight.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "we are able to coordinate with a screen," "" "Mulatu Gemechu said," "" "said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of Oromos." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests were held in the areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have dominated the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray, which accounts for approximately 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military, in trading and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former vineyard leader, was up until his death on a non-sealed disease in 2012 for 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was regarded as a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly tolerated in it, early signs of unsatisfaction and special acquiring to do opponents and make them unharmful.</seg>

<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was selected by relatively untransparent reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Other than Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigra region of North America, Mr. Hailemariam coming from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analyst say that he does not enjoy the trust of the Tigray controlled security services.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many do you fear that the result will be more blood.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time that Ethiopia had experienced an uproar in 2005, after thousands of elections were protesting from the government, according to the information of analytics apparently, and then stolen from the government.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the following Razzien, many protesters were killed, even if there were less than in the last months and this time of the unrest went relatively fast.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopian leaders for its visionary infrastructure, as the new Pendlership, as well as for its measurable progress in poverty.</seg>
<seg id="53">But apparently this did not prevent the intentions of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month protesting in Gondar, a amharic city, of Tigray-guided shops and hatred against the Tigray is always common in social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analyst say that the protests are the USA and other Western Allies in an independent position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as a basis for dronenflights over the neighboring Somalia, even though it has been recently closed that it has closed this base.</seg>

<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland's hair usually come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and swimmers with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland finished only with 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Greenland's ground at the bottom of the North Atlantic ocean along with an average of just 1,220 metres in an hour.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it comes on, the five-meter-long beast accelerates on a satin 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a Robbe.</seg>
<seg id="9">It seems that of loneliness of loneliness, but seems to be a cartridge for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen von der University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reported in the journal Science "journal at least by a Greenland, the 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness," commented on Alexander Scheupon of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock, this life expectancy that means for vertebrates a world record.</seg>
<seg id="12">Although the evolutionary biologian estimated that Greenland has become stone old.</seg>
<seg id="13">Just lacked the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">Grönlandhaie are difficult to observe. finally, they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the thinly populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around six degrees Celsius, immerse it at the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers have been able to know about the lifestyle of Greenland's lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="17">Her time lupempo, they, when it was placed in front of Svalbard six animals with a transmitter.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, spoil this hair: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a Robbe, another one had swallowed up the pine trees of a young iron.</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly they hunt them sleeping animals or patrol at the reason of the ice-sea and search for Kadaver, which is from higher waterlayers to downstairs.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now investigated 28 Greenland, fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland, or Svalbard from the depth of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was only 81 cm long, while the largest 502-centimetres measured.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of animals, they analyzed the lens core with the carbon-14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens has already been created before the birth of Haas, which the proteins contained in it will not be renewed later.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest Haas had a lot of carbon-14 in the lens core.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s, when nuclear power trials increased greater quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the length of 220 cm of the third smallest animal, the left-core contained a low surplus of carbon-14 out of nuclear power, it is likely to celebrate its 50th birthday in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All larger Greenland, normal carbon-14 amounts, which arises by cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14 clock was actually shown for a 493 cm long Greenland an age of 335 years, during the record shark with 502 of 502 was even 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland-females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was well known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now researchers able to arrange the length of the length.</seg>
<seg id="31">As one of the animals with 392 centimeters is probably determined at the threshold of the sexually mature and its age with 156 years, Grönlandhaie was obviously at least one and a half centuries time.</seg>
<seg id="32">This should also be the world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusaleme live mainly in iron waters, is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">The previous record holder, a 211-year-old Grönlandwal, in whose bacon on the neck had a 120-year-old harpoison point, was captured before Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to low temperatures often the organism also runs on savings of asparagus.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and alarms slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in cold water, the animals often are often large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume is growing much faster than its surface due to the animal heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of a gram of mouse is therefore much bigger than one gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "a small animal lives on more dangerous animals and should concentrate on them as soon as possible as many descendants" "" "explains the evolutionary sculptors" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2">Heathrow is not only available in our local municipalities and throughout London, but throughout the country of renewal and prosperity.</seg>
<seg id="3">For me, the biggest attraction is Heathrow, just as in 2012 in London when we used a large effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Olympiad brought great benefits for Stratford and the East End.</seg>
<seg id="5">And that will be reached again by creating new possibilities for ortsansund companies near Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">For our local communities we are already able to create 40,000 new jobs, creating 40,000 new jobs and youth unemployment in the airport environment.</seg>

<seg id="8">I was told that England will never be ready for the games to be found on the world stage.</seg>
<seg id="9">The bifler had wrong in 2012 and they are also wrong with Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="10">There are always obstacles to overcoming, but Heathrow answered each question.</seg>
<seg id="11">Like the Olympic Games Heathrow is for many and not for a infrastructure project.</seg>
<seg id="12">Extension is an option to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion to witty growth and a legacy of skills and jobs to leave the airport as well as in all GB.</seg>
<seg id="13">We have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billions of infrastructure investment program in time and budget, from the T5 - the five years in a row to the world's best airport bus terminal, until the T2, which was built in the middle of the two-frequency-test drives of the world.</seg>
<seg id="14">Now they are ready to supply a third running, which is supported by £16 billion in private investments.</seg>
<seg id="15">The London Games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I'm confident that the extension of Heathrow will also be one.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is time that we expand this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow along with our future trade and create a legacy of skills and jobs that can be proud of England.</seg>

<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus on tools and algorithms that resemble climate research.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere once could have been reported conditions.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously reported that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its thick atmosphere.</seg>

<seg id="8">The planet probably proved more dry areas than de earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to host life and protected from faster evaporation.</seg>

<seg id="13">The model brought a story of Venus, which resembles the evolution which had been suspected of planetary research.</seg>

<seg id="25">They explain their victims per chat, as it can be paid by Bitcoin, freely available support websites one or decrypt free example files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And they will be redeemed individuals according to payments of a few hundred euros, businesses must pay part hard negotiate and five-digit sums to get their data unturnkey.</seg>
<seg id="27">In view of the potentially high and relatively risk profits from the Ransomware relief, the hacker are always professional and share the work, explained security professionals Chester Wisniewski of Internet provider SOPHOS: "a single person can write a Ransomware circa within a week."</seg>

<seg id="32">The pressors are then searching for further hacker to spread the freshly purchased software under the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service economy.</seg>
<seg id="34">So you logged in one of the forums in the underground, buying the set of a crime and commissioned a further way to install the software on as many PCs.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment takes place per content calculator.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "" "" "the detergometers apply spammer with spreading," "" "Wisniewski explains." ""</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now known for many companies to secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">More than 50 percent of the companies IT managers in the Malwarebytes survey confidence on that Ransomware using file-back-ups and scans.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators have already been doing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "if the encryption of data alone does not contain any sufficient threat, the perpetrators, with the publication of sensitive data, such as customer lists or pricing" "", "explains Malwarebytes boss Marcin Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">This is the case of damage, depending on the type of data, even more multiple than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">Also, the perpetrators could take completely new targets on the Internet of Things to take place.</seg>
<seg id="43">On the HackerConference Defcon demonstrated safety forscher, as they could get a thermostat under your control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter, the Freischstrasse could be worth a ransom for such a ransom.</seg>

<seg id="2">Honda HR-V is flexible and everyday applications</seg>
<seg id="3">In the small HR V I want to pack everything: a little SUV, a little Coupé and even the versatility of a minivans.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sounds pretty overloaded, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform like the new jazz, shows itself as extremely flexible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although only 1,60 m high HR-V is rather small, the passengers have a lot of space in the first row and there is no spot in any place.</seg>
<seg id="6">The materials of the inner space are well-processed and can be pleasant, only the cockpit-top falls below.</seg>
<seg id="7">More versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR-V for the storage room.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is not only a boot space of 453 l at high-speed and 1026 l when folded back-folded back, but there is the "Magic Seats."</seg>
<seg id="9">This is less magical, as it sounds: the seat areas of the back bench can be folded as Kinosessel and offer a storage space that is high from the ground up to the ceilings 1.24 m high.</seg>
<seg id="10">The boot space can be loaded well, but the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, he is likely to judge any more silent.</seg>
<seg id="13">The everyday consumption is 4.7 l / 100 km.</seg>
<seg id="14">There is another engine load: a 1.5 liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp.</seg>
<seg id="15">An all-wheel drive is not offered.</seg>
<seg id="16">The driving behavior is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.</seg>
<seg id="17">But the steering should be direct.</seg>
<seg id="18">The equipment can be made in the tested top variant "Executive" no wishes.</seg>
<seg id="19">The city-emergency braking system belongs to the security systems (works up to 32), the collisions-warning system and the trace assistant.</seg>
<seg id="20">Sometimes, the collisions are irculated, because he evaluated many obstacles in the rankings as "herannahating objects."</seg>
<seg id="21">Very reliable, the remote control system works.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent speed controller responds to the traffic sign detection and drosselt when needed the speed.</seg>
<seg id="23">But the full connectivity is available only for the top equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, Navi, App-Integration and more.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB- and one HDMI socket lie under the armrest and are therefore a little bit of permanent.</seg>
<seg id="25">The roughly 29000 Euro for the well-equipped top diesel are fine.</seg>
<seg id="26">Who doesn't want to invest so much, the gasoline engine will receive €20,000, the diesel from 23000 Euro.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the evening they drive for evermore, at night it is time for hours, at the morning it is already far from the wake of sounding.</seg>
<seg id="3">That's all other than relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one of these problems in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, there is about one quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than ten percent emptied their sleep often or permanently.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleeping problems or sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be many different causes, emphasises Hans-Günter Weeß, member of the German Society of Slefforetion and Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What you understands, but is the Insomnie, so an input and leep disorder.</seg>
<seg id="8">Straight to sleep, many people can find many people as harmless or insufficient, Jens Wagenknecht says the board member of the German domestic medical association with practice in Lower Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="9">What's behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleeping disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind that, organic, psychic or insulin-related factors, but also provides medication.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not rare is the sleep expression of another condition.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early watch is frequent, especially at a depression," says Weeß.</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors are required.</seg>
<seg id="15">For example, who has a herniated disc, can be poorly lie, awake every two to three hours and begins to greenware, about all day problems and ensure that Weeß gives an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is not possible anymore.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should you sleep with sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="18">Who is not good for a period of one month at least three nights per week, and the day should be impaired, should go to the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look completely different: one is abrouted, tired, unslipped, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily delightful, has voting fluctuations or physical pain such as stomach or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">In order to prevent the sleeping disorder, it is important to find their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">As a treatment options, behavioral behavioural therapy or medications - classic sleep tablets only in case of exceptional and no more for two weeks - inquiries.</seg>
<seg id="22">Located in Germany, there are hardly any interest in Germany, emphasises Prof. Ingo fibroma, Head of the Interdisciplinary Research Centre of the Charité University Medicine Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is why one should first turn to the house physician at bedtime, wet Weeß.</seg>
<seg id="24">It can clarify if the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should happen to sleep laboratory, and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For examining in the sleeping laboratory in medical laboratory, for example, if swallowed with respiratory hazards, in case of disease or if you don't find the cause of a leep disorder isn't explained.</seg>
<seg id="27">It is necessary to prepare for the study.</seg>
<seg id="28">One should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "please do not make a lunch menu," "" "says Fixed." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">After being shortened, you go to bed at its normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">In addition to the electrodes a Nasenbrille, a chest strap and a Fühler on the finger is wearing.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera also shows the sleeping corner.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can people get the problems in the handle?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are fairly many pitches on which one can put for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">Weeß counts on: regular sleeping and standing times, not too long in bed, not to sleep on the day, not watching television to sleep, alcohol abstain from and at night not at the clock - then we begin to calculate and that's all and not eligible to be eligible.</seg>

<seg id="1">Old buildings, a few lindenks, in between still a remainder of a stone pavement: the Rigaer Street in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not work on the first sight, but the police counts it to the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">You walk along the east to west, you come to playing places, a refreshed kindergarten and a beolades.</seg>
<seg id="3">On the facade of a grey house anyone has ugly "ugly!" sprayed. "</seg>
<seg id="4">Compared to a Lidl which will soon be torn down, it is already built: until 2017 there is a house with high windows and 133 new apartments.</seg>
<seg id="5">Article about this "trendy district," as the competent estate company Friedrichshain is called, in the last weeks, it is preferred with burning cars.</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, the residents are occupied, but on the ground floor there are still rooms, and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, since the beginning of the year, the "No-Go-Zone" for policemen and the 94 was labeled as a "no-go-zone" for police officers and 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">After 22 June the rooms were cleared on the ground floor, the cadterschmiede, with 300 police officers, according to their official statements, according to 30 to 40 civil servants and three team cars on site, locked parts of the street and held visitors to the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, the renovated building worker was commissioned by the premises in the unknown house owner.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July a Berlin administration Court decided that the clearance was illegal, and one day later, police and construction workers moved to the Jubel of sympathizers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon the road works peacefully: parents go with children, people sit on the brushes in front of the houses in the sun, others talk about vorce.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are a primary school and kindergartens in the immediate vicinity of the skin.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left hand is not the main orge of many occasions: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in the pines since 1999, and Jana *, who are here three children, are mainly from the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the residents of skin projects, they share the care before increasing rent and genetic engineering.</seg>
<seg id="15">It sounds not after a pine, which would be able to allow multi-axis protection against vandalarms.</seg>
<seg id="16">The grave, den of Berlin's inner gator and the police, does not exist in their neighbours, obviously not exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the East of Berlin actually was a traditional labour market, which also today has a lower average in comparison to the rest of the city, and high risk of poverty.</seg>
<seg id="18">Also house occupied and the most born residential projects are already long to become pines: in 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including nearly the entire Main street, near the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the mazer had been cleared under the great police, many of the projects were legalized in the Rigaer and are still inhabited by people who occupied them 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, in the past few years, the district has become increasingly for the magnets for tourists and electoral liner from all over the world: with them, residents from GDR-times and former Hauser occupied its pines.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also noticeable in the rentals, which has increased by almost 60 per cent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the newbuildings in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols for this development: they detects them on the panes or fresh-knitted façades, which were subjected to paint spraying.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other road was mentioned in this year so often together with the words "left autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">A reason for that, not all neighbors who can see it as a problem, could not be affected by the crime, according to statistics, statistics are almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">The largest part of the offenders make state-damage, the tends to meet the newly built and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in a rental house in addition to the controversial 94 years, there cannot be any talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">What manner of violence is important: the people in the 94 are their neighbors who have not been determined.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars also give it directly in the Rigs no longer.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the studied architectin, her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary: "here one helps each other, lives together on the road and gets more from each other than what else."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is deliberately moved to the Riga street - and stayed.</seg>
<seg id="31">Therefore, it was so important that the residents had returned their road: from the police, politics and media, which appeared in July all over the district.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of inhabitants such as Neugebauer will continue the road to them: by sociable newly built new buildings in former construction gaps, which are the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "these are the condominiums that are not interesting for many here - here are rather people who are not so good enough," ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"violence and destruction can't be absolutely guilt."</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should I do if you never hear someone?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is also frustration on all sides of frustration, even at the police and the residents.</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuverle is a new refugee camp</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuverle is the contact partnership in terms of integration and organisational.</seg>
<seg id="3">In addition, she is a social worker in front of the site.</seg>
<seg id="4">Annika Deuverle has been the refugee camp for Urbach since July.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogue supports the management of Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees itself as a contact for all actors: refugees, working with refugee assistance, administration, authorities and who else can be carried away.</seg>
<seg id="7">REGINE customer indicates that the ambition is more than thankful, that Deuverle now is that Deuverle is now a problem which has a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">So, some - less spawless than rather, on the multitude of enlightening areas - meant as the administration wanted to write the place.</seg>
<seg id="9">Looking for an administrative force with a talent for languages and people, associated with a long-term experience in the area of social work, a eivable Wollmilchsau.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not their central area, Annika Deuverle.</seg>
<seg id="11">In particular, we go to organization, work with people on site and also behind the scenes as well as network activities.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been around for six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent site for three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "it was the highest time," "" "says Regine client that Annika Deuverle Ehren- and German officials supported." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">There are great and minor problems, organizational, human and understanding problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">New containers will soon be available at the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">It has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connection ploughs, which have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for the connection to the connection.</seg>
<seg id="19">You need to accommodate refugees in own or rented residential rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The costs for construction, rent or renovation of these accommodation must wear the municipalities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility is changes from Landraters, municipality and job center.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search for some time is very difficult for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto find the administration of no private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">It didn't work yet to have been included in private apartments so Deuverle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, the apartments have to be notorious, as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers will be installed in the washing machine.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuverle.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a fixed lead, there are trainees, training places, training courses, one-euro jobs and helpers for refugees and migrants who have to be milled or furnished.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places are well," reports Regine customer.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help household, do non-profit labour - and motivated and very tidy, like Annika Deuverle.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community is to a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">This is "no employment therapy."</seg>
<seg id="35">But it does not only work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day need a fixed structure, say Deuverle and the customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">Human beings have to develop an asrigation experience.</seg>
<seg id="38">So do it require offers like sports, contacts with locals and above all language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rar.</seg>
<seg id="40">So you also skip here administration and honour.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is centrally that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">You need to explain the refugees that it takes and it can make sense of sense, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Those who want to feel the feeling that he could not work in Urbach, do not work, and be unprofitable, who never have to integrate.</seg>
<seg id="45">The distinct majority be motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">But there is also reason to be honest, "people who doesn't work at all." the work of Deuverle and the customer is therefore always motivating others to motivate others.</seg>
<seg id="47">All that is already a "mammoth job."</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: did the two incidents fear radicalization in front of radicalization, also in a small church like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," "" "" "" "says Regine customer" "" "says clearly," "" "what lack of naiv is really good." "" "a residual risk could not be able and would not close them out." ""</seg>
<seg id="50">Yet the helpers are already.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents may be subject to refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They had the fear that the attacks of the attacks were completely resigned.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do," says Regine client. "</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would gladly stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So, main and honors have to look back on site and in the region after activities.</seg>
<seg id="56">In the background they are always in the background, that soon a new stores of refugees and migrants are coming to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Needs Germany need a limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">This question is clear to answer the policy.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually it is unfair, to set helpers on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we are not yet arrived where we would like," says Annika Deuverle.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would relax the situation.</seg>
<seg id="62">REGINE customer is also obvious that the urbacher can also be used to integrate the previous people in sensible.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently around 100 people, mostly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But if people are in need, they have to help them are both women.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there is no simple answers.</seg>
