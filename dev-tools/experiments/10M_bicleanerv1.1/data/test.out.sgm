<seg id="1">Clinics and Trumps Economic Policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and prevent the TTP trade agreement - that's going to be Clinton as well as Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two US presidential candidates are however with the tax and energy policy as well as in a basic request.</seg>
<seg id="4">The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton underlies a fundamental, more philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">The role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep in doubt rather small and warns before, as the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulation.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton complying the economy to death and to be put to death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself would be different, claimed trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">He will return to rule, and he makes himself strong tax reform with lower tax rates strong - for private professionals and for businesses.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton says: the state has certain tasks to accomplish, he has the disadvantageous chances and needs money.</seg>
<seg id="11">Therefore, taxes for the rich will increase, says it.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In which the needs to be invested, Trump and Clinton say almost wortequal.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic applicants announced the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in the infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are rejected by the nationalized Tevy wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So on Trump, there might be still one internal discussions.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policies are significant.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal plants and return coal extraction in the US again.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil extraction is also possible to date protected areas in the protected areas of the climate agreement in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="20">Clinton wants to expand the renewable energies with their investment program and demands: "a country becomes the super-making of clean energies and create million jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it is probably either China, Germany or America - I want that we are there."</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only with the infrastructure - even at international trade agreements, both competitors are not too far away from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, which will not sign azia trade agreement, do not want to sign.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, both the USA do not want to isolate from international trade, but simply protect American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "" "" "they should then be paid better than Clinton." ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7,25 US dollars is a hunger strike.</seg>
<seg id="27">It intends to increase it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What are Trump in this question is not clear: once he says: the minimum wage must be changed, he says he shall not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the great discussion of the coming months is likely to develop well in order to develop the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">On one side, Trump, who wants to load the economy and the citizen to boost growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics keep him before, so that the budget deficit would only be bigger.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton who wants to ask at least of the rich he wants to pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution.</seg>

<seg id="24">In women, other reasons for the escape: "many steal herself secretly, because they don't see any other way."</seg>
<seg id="25">In their home they have experience with sexual violence, forced, honourable, honor of Honor, slavery or forced disstitution.</seg>

<seg id="30">Who think that the end, as soon as they anchor in Germany, irre, tells Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="31">In this way, women in refugee were often considered to be minderous and worse.</seg>

<seg id="41">In Upper Bavaria, underwater and medium-franken are available in some common floors or houses only for single-standing women and their children.</seg>

<seg id="2">Vice-chairman of the assistants have called their union to discuss new labour measures with their disputes regarding a new treaty.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "Alliance of Foreign Affairs"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce their hands and proclaim an official end of the eight-month-long war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin took his Turkish opposite player in the gilded hall of St. Petersburg Palastes in reception, I can't forbid that Ankara wants to hold this reconciliation in most.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the rash, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin met the smiles narrowly and he shines almost heat from itself, even for its restrained conditions.</seg>
<seg id="7">In contrast, Recep Tayyip Erdogan talked about his "dear friend" Putin, according to a report about five times.</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia could not only return to their old level before the crisis, but even to improve itself.</seg>
<seg id="10">On the next day a news described that Erdogan would have had such thought than it would never happen anything.</seg>
<seg id="11">To me the enthusiasm appeared to me rather than the contrary.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin showed that sustainable cooling showed that the Russian President of Russia had forgotten nothing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the crisis of the crisis was the first what he mentioned in his project: the surplus of a Russian campaign aircraft in the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">In Moscow in response to the time it was cold-branched.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin shared from and accused Ankara to have fallen into the back.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was even greater, since it was committed by a friend's friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">The showcases rebuild will be difficult if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">The public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the state controlled media led a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">At once it seemed, the Turks would bear the debt for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">On serious officers, the allegations of senior officials were that Erdogan's own family had benefited from illegal oil trade in the areas of Syria, which will be controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He fought this vehement.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">After all, this meeting was therefore only taking place because Putin received the President Erdogan to excuse the excuse that he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire is clear on the hand.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan is needed in the first line of all friends who can get in a coup d'etat with a failed coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="28">Again, terror attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motifs.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have met Turkey hard - especially the prohibition of charms, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number is decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, travel agents and charter companies will be facilitated when flights will be resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count towards a late relay of the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week predicted the State television cheaper fruit and vegetables, once the Turkish agricultural imported will be allowed again.</seg>
<seg id="35">A report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows: "tourists there long, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is a weak response to the West, since its response to the attempted power was considered a weak answer.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "the persisting grounding over the EU Accession negotiations and Putin - the piping on it is to withdraw from the cool mood and to reduce the relationship from Turkey to the West." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">In Ankara, Russian Heads of State won a bonus that he demanded after the attempted coup d "état for the chosen state of State.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is beneficial for Moscow to change a self-sitting fear of Regimeania.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this glittering palace made it possible to Russia and Turkey, one, as it once described me a analyst, "Alliance of external lateral places." two countries that are led away from the West and is feeling bad.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two still.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently given the role as peace offerings, but where Russia and Turkey supported mutual pages.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be striving that after almost three hours of initial discussions on the Press Conference, they said that they did not count once again.</seg>
<seg id="45">The president of Turkey promised to answer a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize them.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no unique consensus to be found where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster when NATO member Turkey denounces the Russian fighting jet - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State or at least once again speak.</seg>

<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who was a deputy deputy since 2012, was appointed to his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 1972, in the Estonian capital of Tallinn, he graduated from the renowned state of the Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo Embassy in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the website of the Kremlin, it says (in Russian) that he was later protocol director of the government of the government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "he said to Putin:" "" "thank you for your trust." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it is the most important role of the government to support your activity as a leader regarding Legislative Decree and controls to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday, that Ivanov was asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convince the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made mysterious secrets.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergey Ivanov was a long time in the narrowest trusted Vladimir Putin and works as he was responsible for the Soviet secret service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin, who was broadcasted in television in a meeting, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff is returned to his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the harvest for the cameras, there are only few of them convinced - especially in front of the legislative elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So is the consequence of a kind of power?</seg>
<seg id="20">That knows no one knows.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official statement - that a man who once again declared as potential President when Russian environmental policy would like to lead to large skepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks on Putin, which are quoted on the Website of the Kremlin, Ivanov said it is true that I was asked to trust in a conversation with me this very complicated post - you could almost say - protect it for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it represents, I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">He was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin as a member of the State Security Service of KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), Ivanov was appointed to his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin met his power, he called Ivanov as one of five people who trusted in most of them.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once, Ivanov could have been President of Russia after Putin's second term of term, as a third term Putin had to cast Putin's third office in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another, close allies Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister until he became a President in three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunting after health and happiness that pays off</seg>
<seg id="2">It is intriguing to see how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">That teenager and child for games no longer go out to go out, but rather prefer to spend their leisure time, on screens to rigid, was proclaim in the last decade of many.</seg>
<seg id="4">At Pokemon Go it is going to get people from the sofa and be active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time at the screen was initially limited to the TV, then on video games and most recently to smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">Therefore it's great to see that technology and activity do not exclude their activities in the open.</seg>
<seg id="7">I joined the Pokémon Go-Wahn, which is based on the characters, first created for video games in the 1990s (later produced a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-off).</seg>
<seg id="8">How many phenomena of popculture sank the interest before the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was postponed by massive demand that overloads the server.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days Pokémon Go is more user than Tinymns and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, players with their smartphones go out to the outside and search for Pokémons, who are persecuted with a GPS, as soon as they were found once, "photographed" (over a screenshot on the phone) or "captured" can be taken.</seg>
<seg id="13">One generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the wake up and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the US, the game led to a considerable increase in steps that determines the "average" person each day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiac, an app for Apple Watch, followed by 35,000 users, divided the Washington Post recently, that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of people followed, who jumped every day 30 minutes, from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company doesn't know what Pokémon Go - it looks just the raw information about the performance increase.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many public awareness campaigns to health, people want to bring "30 minutes to", "from the sofa" and "every day to his" steward ears, because many public messages are boring in health and will look like people who look like.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the significance of sport can not be overrated.</seg>
<seg id="19">Those regularly drives sports, reduces its chances to get to cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of advantages, which is too long to lead them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful to Pokémon Go is that there are people doing something in the open, that you have fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus, three pillars of health are covered, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people close on hunting even new friends.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always, there is also monal gamers who must always complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone might run against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What should it be?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smartphone apps had already been able to follow @ Fitbit earlier, they gave us no reason to play sport like this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The New will lose his maturity and the use will be returned with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, because of Pokemons success, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with the activity in the real world and will help many people in the hunt, active, reapers and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="17">It was expected her last examination in Brazil, a contest, which was not so very between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather, between their and a load oversized expectations.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I present myself under the women's première in the tower and that consists of more than a reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First I've been with each Summer Olympics in 1984 and the US had never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And second: this team has three Turnerve, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspiring many young girls of other skin colour.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jew is and Madison Kocian, the Cathokin is, round, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This crew finally reflects the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport art.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years, number one was one of the female gymnasts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year, Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">During the last Olympic Games Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympiad in America.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world champion Simone Biles, Douglas, and Laurie Hernandez to be like it was unexpected, but masterful Gymastic routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone the fourth, heterosexual American, who won gold medal for women with an individual competition event.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the tip of this sport, but the turnaround classes do not see all the country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie fought all the same way as Aly and Madison, to create the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">They are the "Last Five," because the next Olympic Games is only four Turnerve in the team. Moreover, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as trainer.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality looks like that Turns is a more expensive sport, and Turner at first line in private gym, who will count on their training, setting, travel, clothing, competition and hotel costs (for the coach and their Turner and families).</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these turnaround lie in wealthy suburbs, which can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs, Turner received their total training, and this is a expensive and long-term commitment.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have trained both their athletes, since they started with the tower since.</seg>
<seg id="22">We must inspire the municipalities Aun countless, young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, a powerful and easy access turnable.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my gymnast Foundation of 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">For my events, we have free and affordable Turns in Harlem for over 15,000 students (mainly black and hispanic), and national and international victorious winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer high-quality exercises that make the opportunity to learn of this great Olympic sports art.</seg>
<seg id="26">Turbochargers develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and destination for the spirit.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers vital benefits for health, as well as for school and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that bring thousands of young girls to be interested in the tower and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of "Girl Power" by the Holes of the Olympic Team Congolds and thank you to start a lot of young girls with different background to start healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="2">A British Reiser subdued his immune system and dignity of a serious review by taking some of the most dirty and most beautiful places of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The moderator and itautor Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk will set his wake up on a Euro bill, a hinge at Piccadilly Circus, a purge knob of a pulling toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance of its immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before the empower of each object, he used a Luminometer to show himself and to show us what he is going to leave.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" brought some surprising results in daylight.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought to hide the flashing pot of a pulling toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others, it really can be impervious to be found in a kitchen molecules more bad bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright with doctors and medical professionals spoke about the promotion of gut bacteria and its own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Luckily, did not leave what he put off, more than a bad retaste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright has been known to test the resistance of its gut by playing the world through the world, as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">Of public funds to train stations up to dishonturers of toilets, the task presented its immune system definitely under one sample</seg>
<seg id="11">In the film he told: "as a child I was relatively unconcerned, what my health concerns, and I have put all possible things in my mouth, Earth, worms and sludge."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the movie he was justified to his call.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing that he refused, was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">Its proportions showed a luminance of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">Compared with this, the Luminometry number is fresh washed hands less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet, which he refused to refuse, after her Luminometrics has over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have a height of less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products validated the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">In the film he says: "this comes to the worst, which I have rounded up in a toilet, close."</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing dirt more than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will spare here for nothing because it is inside the box here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company uses Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria, as well as vitamin C and D, to support the support of gut bacteria and immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">Validates Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "we wanted to offer the consumer people really something new.</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating for watching and at the same time the advantages of Probiotics "explains.</seg>
<seg id="25">We led the crazy Brainstormings, which led to us that we said "Let's call us Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that interest in health health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of just over the products we wanted to present them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of the intestinal health and how it is associated with the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in the intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide more information on an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who led the directing of the film, said: "let me lose my respect for Ian, if he had tasted some of the things I've been tried to empty the Russian toilet, which is shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things where it was easier to bring Ian, they hedges and others, with which this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">I'm glad we have recorded some of these dirty lesions on film. "</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey carried out by the survey carried out by 2015, 84 per cent of all respondents in Lactobacilli, especially with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58 percent said that they contain at least occasionally products that added Milorish bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="25">And with a few points - the unequal treatment of commemoration, for example - is the question: what does that actually do with security and terror?</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination boards: who actually buy sound plates?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men of middle age love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you see the comment section in order to overseeding him under the pseudonym non-samlegenic defects, this statement leads up from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov the multiplicity recovery of sound plates do not want to welcome to a boom in millennials, which is to welcome the restling of physical objects, but on Midlife nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who have recently purchased a plate, are all preview according to the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most likely buyer group.</seg>
<seg id="7">There is also no hordes by Hobbysammers - there has been a emotional meaning: older record buyers keep their feelings rather than (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy the time spending time (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog would be a message report in television, I would follow the camera, while I carry out a modest street in Soho, a modest grey suit and wild striker before I standing, my hands hold and something best determinants such as: "so, let's throw a closer look."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let us take a look.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even if the Heart SoHos is slowly waiting for its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices, now fill up the buildings where there were once independent sellers - there is a handful of fantastic record-specialized shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would ask the camera aman to turn the camera for the next part, in which I'm standing in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to estimate their age and mind through observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, the I of Sister Ray (Data: two young women, three men of mean age) into Reckless Records (number of number: eight men of mean age, one woman, probably around the 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through business to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is it a collector, I wonder?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess," says he.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3.000 or 4,000 sheets.</seg>
<seg id="17">These sound plates, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I didn't have followed him home), dressing the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles, is the result of its available income: it is now able to buy records that he could not afford to buy articles and buy objects, which he sold, when he was young and pleite.</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy, are from the late 60s, early 70's, who appeared, when I was 11 or 12. things I probably had something too young to buy them," says he.</seg>
<seg id="20">He is true that those who buy records are rather disclosed and would like to spend alone time, and add: "I smoke not and I drink not much.</seg>
<seg id="21">That is my laster.</seg>
<seg id="22">Wez, 25, who works with Sister Ray, also believes that many customers who meets the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, he also noticed a new wave of people who influenced by the Medienhpe, people who have heard about the comeback in order to buy their old records.</seg>
<seg id="24">Of the conversations that I have led, people usually have buried their collection in 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers that once sold their records sold to buy CDs, sell their CDs to buy their records, "says he.</seg>
<seg id="26">That would explain the boom on appendices of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional importance of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a business like phonica to realize that record business offers a soothing community of equality.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to Wez, some of the older customers participated in the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some turnaround fans will be overwhelmed by the digital world and would like to withdraw the stability of confidential Schallplattenings, from objects, the happier youth agreement.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I think sometimes it can be the colt of a void or the possession of the property by a type of comfort," "" "says Wez." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">That is with me as a collector so and I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal spiritually.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social worker!" "" "a staff employed from a plate stack." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey carried out by the ICM in April, that nearly 50% of the people who have bought a plate has not yet heard.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% have a turntables that they never use, while 7% of those who buy a plate, do not own turntables.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this point of the news report I would probably look very worried, while I blossessed by a stack of Bossa Nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at sounds of the Universe (number of data: three men of middle age), has noticed a "trophy" of the Revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone recently returned here and said:" I don't want a record player, but I would like to buy a Radiohead sound plate, that I can put it into the shelf. "</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a great percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productive, less musicasty.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I have no turntables."</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older who only enter slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, dedicated to the sound plates nearly a whole floor, has a blower audience, when I am clean.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around 70, tourists who make photos, teenager and women mean age.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is a little less relaxed than in the above-standing stores - Wild Beasts of the latest synthesizers and state-wing pop instead of experimental jazz. it is good to see such a density at the customer.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them sees strange, but nagating psychmatic gmata are hard at hard, if you are standing for 30 seconds next to someone.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around the store for some minutes and considers the variation of the plates for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It rather makes a shovent rave as a big buy-buy.</seg>
<seg id="50">They don't deserve a lot, so the Collections of records have no real option, says it.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs much.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to listen to music from a computer or to other way but the beauty of plates is... "it drives with a delightful sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it is really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said that a new generation of record lovers have to be inspired: Urban Outjams.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I wish to sample the Jeans Hotpants, I observe a group of young teenager, which is based on a moment for polaroid cameras, before a father and his daughter is superior to buy a Crosley record player.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left there is a staircase, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a blend of contemporary music and classics that essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">No one sees them - perhaps because they are only pure decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to hold them.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But in view of that any attraction for these items are more money for the industry and some customers could be sent to the depths of SoHos for more, there's nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money as others, also the one that gives most of the luxury objects like boards.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even if my research shows that the results of YouGov agree that the great number of female collectors in Soho, the great number of female collectors in Soho, exist in reality, business transactions, and Onlineforums exist, not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard in school or offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday morning with security on the stroll through sheet shops of Berwick Street and the leaves through plates, while it peaks the starring view of an unsecret, 30-year-old false moderator to avoid evil men's mean age.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of provisional stores and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, in which thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">During a trial of hearing this week, the authorities in Calais, that the state should be suckled to sell 72 provisional stores, sell to 72 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants.</seg>

<seg id="6">They also led out that the provisory shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need to offer.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who had the 72 provisional businesses, but dreamed that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais "was absolutely perfect."</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive performance of Great Britain at the 7-year Rugby came to a abrupt stop at the last hurdle in the form of Fijis, when they were routed with a result of 43-7 at Deodoro stage here in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji invented a master class in the handling, Side-Stepping, Afterwards, liner and rocking strength to win gold - their first Olympian for every color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was dispatched by the non-bad consolation prize of the silver medal - Great Britain's fourth day - and they couldn't be proud of their efforts in this tournament, in which they struck New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day could fall back to them in the finals.</seg>
<seg id="6">But regardless of it Fiji could have beaten a 15-man team in the form of this form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be for GB a consolation - but it is probably not that at least a Brite morning will have a gold medal around his neck: Fijis head coach Ben Ryan, the former boss for England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult road behind him.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago it was lost at Ryan every game with Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lost only one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This cap is weave, but the progress is astonishing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji started wonderful and caused the attacks of the GBS attacks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt like Captain Tom Mitchell and Co. on, when you run in driving buses. the World Series winner went 5-0 to the top when Osea Kolinisau finished in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With another four minutes of playing, Jerry Tuwai released another attack from the right corner, which he walked.</seg>
<seg id="15">The ball was built between 12 and 0 and GB.</seg>
<seg id="16">A close leg of Mitchell stops the mountain of Mann Leone Nakarawa a third gate, but it has just stopped Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute Jasa Veremalua in the right corner a touch down and there stood 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new since the revival and there was still over a minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou prefixes a weak tacklings of the UK teams and stormed up to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It's so, when Fiji was born to play the 7, while GB still homes.</seg>
<seg id="22">So it is also.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB introduced basic changes to half-time through and closed the fijiic gap... for all four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time, until Joshua Tuisova ran after a hilliant intermediate play of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton launched an attempt for GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game went long in favor of the South Africa, whose fans snippers, flags velled and danced on the Tribune.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playbase Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame put the i-bag with another attempt in the last seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Pfiff ertains that Fijis turned out and GB are roasted and defeated in the lawn.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier on the day, Fiji Japan defeated a semi-final with 20-5 defeated and Britain pressed South Africa into a crisp half-finalmatch from the race - UK's transformation of difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the boat in the first half to the front, but Dan Norton took the line with an impressive floor work and achieved a gate under the post in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliantly late tackling from Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside Teams, secured the winning - and therefore the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspires the fight with the cancer of the trainer for rowing victory</seg>
<seg id="2">There will be no emotional gold than those games to play and that wants to be called.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first strokes up to the last, 220 hard pulses that enter into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional significance in her golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even though it was only those who sat at the rudes, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the trainer Robin Williams, was present as she became the second Olympian in the two without tax woman, the first women in the history of British Sports which had a scale of such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Its dominance was absolutely, after all of their 39.ter use, which is also exemplary.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we are visible are two brilliant athletes competing with the elegance of swings, what do not reflects the kind of Arc de Triomphe.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind each gold in Rudern, a battalion will help to contribute to the incremental progress, which make up the difference and there was no more beneficial than the trainer, who would not survive that day when he was diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said, he riseth what risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer, which is operable and they did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not do that, spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been quite serious situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It has a little a view.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Trio had luck that he could be in the beginning of 2014, out of season, starting the break at a minimum, if this is the correct term.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, therefore it had to be better again soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in the hospital and ran on the station at around - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough.</seg>
<seg id="18">That is how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">The rowing is already a challenge, but this makes it even larger.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the inability of the victory, their first thought on Williams, who spent a nervous morning with it, so much more than otherwise, tried to handle his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">Stanning who was as Captain of the Royal Artillery Regiment in a use in Afghanistan, "I was this week a emotional wreck. this is perhaps something extremely, but it means so much."</seg>
<seg id="22">It repeats only how much I mean that how much I and Helen and also Robin have worked.</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin, we are no one, therefore a massive Danke is going on him. he is the best trainer of the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I would have no better person to have a trainee or better coach.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost any race in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The pair had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not survive.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to suspend, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were caught very at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen called "remain in the process, lasting in the process."</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important to rip itself.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not going to make something ponds.</seg>
<seg id="33">We wanted no firework today, we wanted to score a good result, go out and win the race what we did.</seg>
<seg id="34">The pair will take a break for one year before it will make decisions about his future.</seg>
<seg id="35">Glover must appear next week on a wedding, their own with the TV adventures of your Steve Backshall.</seg>
<seg id="36">Now they just wants to enjoy the moment.</seg>
<seg id="37">I didn't want to say that my last race was.</seg>
<seg id="38">That would have too much pressure.</seg>
<seg id="39">In London it took about six months to realize that I am a Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="40">It was all so new for me and I was so gesture.</seg>
<seg id="41">It took about four minutes.</seg>
<seg id="42">That feels so much better, "she said.</seg>

<seg id="2">The singing was accompanied by Ursel Kipp her whole life: as a young girl she studied the subject of music in the course of apprenticeship, and today it sings the 78-year-old in a senior citizen.</seg>
<seg id="3">"I move - emotional and physical," she describes.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal she feels balanced, merry and a total of living, says it.</seg>
<seg id="5">All of them do good with their health and their spirit.</seg>
<seg id="6">For singing is equal from several perspectives a great hobby for seniors, Erhard Hackler says of the German senior league.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most of the seniors in chorus and divide the joy of music, describes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through the regular merger, senior citizens can link social contacts and maintain.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because often social and family structures in the age of, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">This experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir: "to get off and organise themselves to the others - a choir is a very special form of the compositions."</seg>
<seg id="11">To sing in the positive sense, Hackler believes.</seg>
<seg id="12">For it training seniors a deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Anyone who calls his lungs regularly calls itself also in everyday life as fast from the purest.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even though it goes to get the sound of the voice at the age, Singen is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">On older people, Singen often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the federal working group of senior citizens.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations, the joint singing had a much higher job, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and leisure, explains them.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observed that singing or listening of songs with older people are weaving many memories, often linked with positive feelings of their youth.</seg>
<seg id="18">By Liedtexte and especially melodies themselves dementia people at long-lying events.</seg>
<seg id="19">In addition, a special performance requires a special performance, Lenz will have a special performance.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, at the same time, focus on their own voice and to adapt to another rhythm, this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Just older people who live alone, do not only practice themselves to concentrate on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition of which by the singing in the choir, Hackler believes.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem is also growing by singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">Even to show yourself: if I have long for something, I will get better and watch beyond me - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to start with the singing, so it's enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Anyone who wants to try out a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he believes, little talent, don't hesitate.</seg>
<seg id="28">We sings not sing alone - at 50 singing people, who hears it if there is a tone beside it?</seg>
<seg id="29">In search of the suitable offer, seniors various possibilities, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">Sings someone out of the coworacle in a nursery, you can easily connect.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer views over the choirs in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Who wants to sing in a church choir, can turn directly to the church or church leaders.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many homes can be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">If you have no access to the Internet, the family, friends or neighbors can ask help at the Internet computers.</seg>
<seg id="35">Those who desire to sing, should necessarily be connected to a chorus, avackler.</seg>

<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a lady of black with dimples, could have been sent to the Prime Time, based on sponsors and well-listed TV advertising when it was a swimmers, Turner or even Freal.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, was fighting in the Olympic trampolines by gold.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame illuminates no event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the center, some in the shade are the sports that are not recognized: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, Taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the chest swimming and may have to rule long.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I want to make a modest arguments for my particular lovers, then let me take the attention to the discreet charm of the trampolines.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the tramp jump already has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had his debut in Sydney, it was the last 16 years so many those that I asked, did not know that it is a Olympiasome.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could be regional Ignoanz.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA sent athletes for competition, it has never gained a medal in the trampolines and had a athletes until 2012, who made it to the final round.</seg>

<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennon from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampolintro has some exterior charme, partly because it sounds for the incorrupted ear for a clownsschule as the for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I'm not an expert but only a bound enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorous potential - the cartoonous trembling of his never to end, but also the grazie of gymnastens and diving, the two sports, that combines it mainly.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "the word" "" "trampoline" "" "comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means so much means" "" "jumps" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Skipping winner jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and need a number of falling movements (turning, Hreal and saltos) before they landing on the feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">They will be assessed according to the official Olympic Committee, difficulty, difficulty and flight time.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two-undated athletes from 17 countries, 16 males and 16 women who compete against each other in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallible must continue in their streches after gold, faster, upward and dron, sometimes up to the finish, sometimes go and back, after top and down at the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They chase not only the finish line or the output level, but in the TV broadcast also another cavity goal: the world or the Olympiad.</seg>
<seg id="28">The targeted headlines is the Nobel, admired, even fanatic - and it's enough to stir even a spectator to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I want to look at this games as something tired.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a breathing break.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampolines is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she prallt, seemingly heavy metals like a astronaut, goes down to the top, then go back up again.</seg>
<seg id="34">Also here is a contest, of course not without difficulty, but during exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreaming, elegant repeal of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is so Zen as the competition only can be at the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualifications and final wounds of the women will take place on Friday afternoon in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will exude the end of a afternoon block of 2 days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the middle of the Olympia Manie, they promise a quiet, nice moment, who is likely to see in general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the consciousness could only be achieved by the attacks and the object of male athletes, as it became the male US Turner at the The Wall Street Journal recently - and then Mr. Dooley awaits its following the air, new fan community.</seg>

<seg id="6">In the last ten years, it was one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid associate of West Africa with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>

<seg id="13">"it was always difficult to hold this land and in future, it will even be even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populated country of Africa, and its stability is estimated from the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiopians, in order to fight terror over the region, especially in Somalia. only few countries in Africa, if ever, get so much western help.</seg>

<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has drastically improved - there is a new commuter train in Addis Ababa's capital.</seg>
<seg id="18">The streets are generally quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if Ethiopia was all other as a model for democracy - human rights organisations have led the repression caused by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted, the dissidents were effective for silence.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or prison, killing or put into the wilderness of the wilderness.</seg>

<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints, which cover everything from the bottom of land until the worrying handle in relation to power of the regained coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a far-term critical election of last year, the rainy party and its allies got the last seat of the opposition, and now serves 100 percent of the parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, the tensions along the border to Eritrea; a fight for this zag, controversial line demanded in June hundreds of lives.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysis fears that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front, or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which were more or less, were able to protect turbulences and can be armed.</seg>
<seg id="29">To explain several factors why feelings of the biting after years ago explode in the surface explode.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years, many Ethiopians were able to communicate using the social media, because cheaper smartphones have been more frequently and improved the Internet services.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even when the government closed the access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do in regular intervals, especially with protests, many people can still communicate over the internet proxies that hide it up.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians stated that they gathered themselves as protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there are more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two biggest ethnications in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">Since branches, the Amharas, which come from branches of the predominantly of Christian high countries, in politics and economy, while they exploited the Oromos, of which many Muslims are living and living in flat areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this also changes.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are here to coordinate under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="39">The most important protests were held in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray, which accounts for about 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military, in the secret services, and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was held until his death at a non-public disease in 2012, 17 years of Ethiopians Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts predict that he was especially advisable to use early signs of dissatisfaction and special promotions to make admissions and to make them unharmful.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the current regime is missing in this basic" "", "Mr Abdi, a conflict analyses." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopian new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen out of relatively untransparent reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Other than Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr Hailemariam coming from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analyst say that he doesn't enjoy the trust of the Tigray controlled security services.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many believed that the result will be more blood.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time that Ethiopia had such an uproar in 2005, after thousands of elections were protested, according to the information provided by analytics, and then stolen from the government.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the following Razor, many protesters were killed, even though it were less than in the last months and that time of the rest went relatively rapidly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Ethiopian leader for its visionary infrastructure planning, as the new commuter train, as well as for its measurable progress in poverty.</seg>
<seg id="53">But apparently this does not prevent the intensification of the internal misery of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">The last month there were protestant in Gondar, a amharic city, from Tigray, and the hatred towards the tigray will always be experienced in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analyst say that protests brought the U.S. and other Western allies in a separate position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used the Ethiopia as the basis for dronenflights on the neighboring Somalia, even if she has recently overlooked this base.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland: the oldest eddy is nearly 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">More rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland's hair usually come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This Hai was allowed to return on board ship Sanna to the sea after an investigation on board.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was born in 1624 and swimmers with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Grönlandhaie get only 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">On average, the Greenland's ground level, in an hour, on average, it is just 1,220 meters far away.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it comes down, the five metre long animal accelerates from a full 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a Robbe.</seg>
<seg id="9">This loneliness lifestyle seems to be a sponsorship for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" in any of Greenland, the 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness," commented Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for demographic Research in Rostock which means a world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="12">Indeed, the evolutionary biologist suspected that Grönlandhaie will be old.</seg>
<seg id="13">Just missing the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland's hairy are difficult to observe, finally, they live mainly in the polar sea before the thinly populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water-temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, immerse them on the surface usually only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">About the lifestyle of Greenland, researchers have to know according to little.</seg>
<seg id="17">Your timesupunempo limbs it, when they took six animals in front of top six animals with a transmitter.</seg>
<seg id="18">The prey make this hair nevertheless: in the stomach of a beast found the remains of a Robbe, another one had blown the orbones of a young Eisbären.</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly they hunt them sleeping animals or patrol on the basis of the ice sea and are looking for Kadaver, from higher water slides after bottom.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Svalbard as an interest from the depth of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 cm long, while the largest 502 of cm measured.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of animals, they analyzed the lens core of the Haie with the carbon-14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This center of the eye lens is already constructed before the birth of the sharks, which were not renewed in it later.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks showed a lot of carbon-14 in the lens.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth should therefore lie down to the early 1960s, as nuclear tests attempts to reduce larger quantities of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the length of 220 centimeters in length, the third smallest animal contained the lens core contained a low surplus of carbon-14 out of the atomic fact that it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All major Greenland cells had normal carbon-14 amounts, which arises from cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14-clock was shown for a 493 centimeter long Greenland, an age of 335 years, while the record-shark with 502 centimeters is likely to be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Grönlandhai-females only then get offspring, when they are longer than four meters, was well known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers found the length of an age.</seg>
<seg id="31">As one of the animals with 392 centimeters, probably at the threshold of the sexually mature and his age at 156 years was determined, Grönlandhaie can be found at least one and a half centuries.</seg>
<seg id="32">Also this is likely to be the world record.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusalism live primarily in icy waters, is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">Also the previous record holder, a 211-year old Greenland, a 120 year old harpoem tip, was caught on Alaska in front of Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">At low temperatures, the organism also runs the living animals on the Sparflames there.</seg>
<seg id="36">So you mature later - and alarms slow.</seg>
<seg id="37">To keep warm in cold water, the animals are often very large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because it grows much faster than its surface due to the animal heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much bigger than with a gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "so a smaller beast lives more dangerous and should focus on themselves, as soon as many generations," "" "the Evolutionbiologist Scheuerlein." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="42">A very big animal ought to invest his resources rather into a long life.</seg>

<seg id="2">From Scotland Callum Skinner's last evening in the male team-sprint in Rio to fame, when the British Team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the Anke role, who had made his landing of Sir Chris Hoy. the Jing and made the legend proud to enter a victory of favourites from favorites New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">Four years ago, England claimed a shocking victory while Hoy took the fifth of six Olympioldmedaillen.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick, after they took place in March at the railway World Championships in London despite the back of Hoys just a modest sixth place.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the substitute for Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as an execution.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retired a gap that tried to close Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man who stayed at which she stayed when they saw the potential in the sots, which is now unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hinder, Kenny - who won four years ago with Hoy and Skinner placed an Olympiad lap in the qualification round, but in the standing round the New Zealand took place in the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hinder was just returned after his lap, but Kenny brought the team to the front and Skinner.</seg>
<seg id="13">A strategic change made a large part of transformation from, with the Hinder in a higher gear, to slow it down to slow it and especially Skinner to keep the pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy saw from his position as a BBC expert from and fell Skinner, Kenny and Hindes, when they were on the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said: "it is a flattering comparison."</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best to do and make me a name.</seg>
<seg id="17">We set up a Olympiad ord in the final round and defeated the World Champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the triumph in 2012 on the page Kennys and Hoys there was the way that he fell down to the railway at a weak start.</seg>
<seg id="21">He returned this statement later and there was no objection of England Rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">For such an outstanding victory there was no problem this time.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "it said," "" "It feels like all the UK flagship to the Tribune as London." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">We joined the team in the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We are so bad at so many world titels so badly away that it was incredible again at the Olympiad.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event that won a gold medal for the Nation, who won seven of 10 titles both in Beijing and London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If that is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we expect successful five days at the bicycle stream.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form of labels it is in the field of possible that he repeated the Hoys victory of three Olympic gold medals in a contest.</seg>
<seg id="29">That would be exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was born on March 23 (a apparently holy date for British sport; on which day, Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">The cage of Hoy equals.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny will take part in the Sprint, which starts today and will go over three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">The 28-year-old from Bolton said: "I enjoy this just for the moment."</seg>

<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will be held on the second day of the contest, in which Wiggins will focus on safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">He had fought yesterday with evidence before the qualification, when the functionaries had called, to measure his height.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the appealing women's competition, tomorrow continued and finished, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in world record time at 4: 13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB team is leaving on his strong railway team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a shame to medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly outstanding representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio was launched.</seg>
<seg id="46">It's down in the background, the resignation of the Shane Sutton's resignation in April in the midst of Sexy and mobbingents as well as the retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>

<seg id="2">The future of the aluminium melts of Portland, Victoria - as well as hundreds of workplaces of workers - stand on the game, since the plant operator will terminate the energy supply contract and thus overtake all delivery contracts such as the supplier of energy companies.</seg>
<seg id="3">This step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies on operation of the plant.</seg>
<seg id="4">A payout of 20 years from the payout runs in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2,000 jobs in the plant of ALCOA in Portland.</seg>
<seg id="6">No less than 2000 workstations -direct and indirect - could be threatened with closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, it could come to Dominic effects, as the melting system uses around 10 percent of the whole power generation of Victorias.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014 ALCOA closed the Point Henry melt, which led last year to a closure of the Anglesea power plant.</seg>
<seg id="9">The melt of ALCOA in Portland pays money and risked up a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows the longlary speculation regarding the future of the system, initially as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the electricity price for the system.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, which makes the large aluminum melting with his Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, distributed that three further owners will terminate their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">The plant is in the majority of a joint venture by ALCOA and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp will hold smaller shares.</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL assumes that the plant continues to be operated in Portland, which means another physical demand for electricity by the melting of water," divided the company.</seg>
<seg id="14">AGL said, "" "" securing transactions "" "" shall continue to be in force as of November 2016. "" "</seg>
<seg id="15">The contracts have a 12 month period of notice that they will end in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "hence, AGL assumes that contracts for the fiscal year 17 will contribute to the revenue," "" "said the supplier supplier." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential impact on the revenues in AGL from the GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong terminal markets for wholesale electricity prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">AGL shared that it had already written the value of contracts at its annual financial statements in the amount of $187 million in "anticipation of a cancellation."</seg>
<seg id="19">ALCOA said that the decision to book the treaties, the "Skill Alcoas... the smoothpaste or the power supply to the melting point is not impaired."</seg>
<seg id="20">The U.S. company said that it has concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, who had to have entered into effect from November this year, even if there is another explanation, why it is returned from the contract.</seg>
<seg id="21">Analysis of analysis due to the poor economic conditions of the industry before the possible closure of the Portland melting centre in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">In reference to the statements of analyst at the beginning of the week, Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland generates about 600 megawatts and Tomago generates approximately 900 megawatts of electricity per year.</seg>
<seg id="23">If both plants disappear from the market, this would mean considerable reduction in demand on the [current market].</seg>

<seg id="10">With a circumference that resembles a photo band as a fashion magazine, the edition attracts a large number of advertisements (Laut Fashionista, on the 832 pages of the Bearings 615 pages advertisement).</seg>

<seg id="15">But even at the low chance that Mrs. Jenner - described by the magazine as the "passage model" of its generation, is described under the previous category, is located in good company.</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality Stars or young people from today, know how to move a good snapchat video (even if everything related to Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women who draw up in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had the release of Lemonade one of the most successful years of her career.</seg>
<seg id="19">Of course Jenners don't like success everyone.</seg>
<seg id="20">With its reality TV history, Jennant's position was always a little bit strained in the fashion world.</seg>
<seg id="21">In June criticised the last Victoria's Secret-Modell Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleagues in Gigi Hadid and called them "the mistakage of the eyes."</seg>

<seg id="2">The Venus was according to the projections of a new NASA climate model probably once inhabitable.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus and algorithms that are similar to those of climate research.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere once deposited with similar conditions.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists previously pointed out that the slow revolution of Venus could be explained by its density of atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation indicates that Venus had a thin but similar atmosphere could have had, and still slowly turned.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model was illuminated by the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably demonstrated more dry places than the earth, but had once enough water and geographical variability to host life and protected from faster evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation, the slow revolution of Venus had exponated its daily side of the sun almost two months," explained GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds, which works as a rainmaker to parachute the surface of a large sun heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result are average temperatures that are some degree cooler than those of the earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model brought a story of the Venus that resembles Evolution which was previously assumed by Planetary Research.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although they were presumably inhabitable to Venus, the Venus was exposed in the course of several billion years of --too much heat and ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans evaporated and its water vapor was burned down by ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">When the hydrogen was removed only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect - Venus, which know how we know it today.</seg>

<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage falls off, if a Ransomware does not beat.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 per cent of the German companies reported revenues losses by Ransomware, 13 per cent, even the business activities had to fall complete, in case of a human being.</seg>

<seg id="23">The hacker again know this and try to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, the safety forscher of F-Secure examines the user areas and contact with the compressors and come to the result: the perpetrators are actually trying to set a kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They tell their victims by chat as they can pay by bitcoin, freely accessible support sites, or decrypt free example files.</seg>

<seg id="27">In view of the potential high and relatively risk winnings from the Ransomware processing, the hacker will always share professional and share the work, explains security professionals Chester Wisniewski, by the Internet provider SOPHOS: "a single person can write a Ransomware around within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">More likely is it that it is about three or four people.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their damage software then in the form of a software construction to the real lock.</seg>

<seg id="36">"" "" "" "usually, the criminals then apply spammer with the spread," "" "Wisniewski explains." ""</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now known for many companies that make their data better.</seg>
<seg id="38">More than 50 percent of companies-IT processors have trusted in the Malwarebytes-survey, Ransomware by using file-back-ups and scans software.</seg>
<seg id="39">"" "accordingly, the perpetrators have already pursue new strategies." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="40">"if the encryption of data alone is no sufficient threats for successful pathogen, the perpetrators, instead, with the release of sensitive data such as customer lists or primandations," explains Malwarebytes-boss Marcin Kleczynski.</seg>
<seg id="41">This makes the damage potential according to type of data even more multiple than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">The perpetrator could also take completely new goals on the internet of things in the future.</seg>
<seg id="43">On the hackerconference Defcon demonstrated safety forscher, how they could get connected with the Internet connected thermostat under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter the activation of a derart blockaded heating could be quite a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators, instead of heating in the future, can block all the production street in a factory, Ransomware could also be a theme in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="3">In the small HR-V Honda will unpack everything: a little SUV, a little coupé and even the versatility of a minivans.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sounds pretty much, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform, like the new jazz, is indeed very flexible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although only 1,60 m high HR-V rather small, the passengers have a lot of space both in the first row as well as in the barrel.</seg>

<seg id="8">It is not just a boot storage of 453 l at high and 1026 l when folded back tailrests, but there is the "Magic Seats."</seg>
<seg id="9">That is less magic, as it sounds: the seat areas of the rear bench can be folded like Kinosessel and offer the storage space, which is 1.5 m high from the floor to the ceilings 1.24 m high.</seg>
<seg id="10">The boot space can be loaded well, however, the load height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, he is likely to teach his job.</seg>

<seg id="23">However, the full connectivity is only available for the top-configuration: 7-inch touchscreen, Navi, App Integration and more.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB- and an HDMI socket lay down under the armrest and therefore are therefore a little bit hard to reach.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the evening, one will be around for ever, at night you can sleep hours in the morning, and in the morning there is no longer thinking about sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">That's all others as a relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one is with such problems in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, approximately one quarter of adults had sleep disorders and more than ten percent you can find their sleep often or permanently as non-relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How are sleeping difficulties or sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disorders, and it can underlying them many causes, emphasises Hans-Günter Weeß, member of the German Society for Sleeving and Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What you think about it is, however, the insomnia is never so an input and sleep disturbance.</seg>
<seg id="8">Just the playful people can find many people as harmless or inadequate, Jens Wagenknecht, member of the German house medical association with practice in Lower Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="9">What's behind sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Inter alia, organic, psychological or unconditional factors, but also contains medicines.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not rare is the sleep disturb expression of another disease.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "very early awakening is often frequent in depression," "" "says Weeß." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors may need to each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">Who, for example, has a herniated disc, can be bad, wakes every two to three hours and begins to greasy on everyday problems and effort, gives Weeß an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should I do with sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="18">Who doesn't sleep over a month in at least three nights per week and impaired on the day should go to the doctor, ask Weeß.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look completely different: one is beaten, tired, unleaked, has difficulties with the attention and the concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical complaints like stomach or headaches.</seg>
<seg id="20">To bend the sleep disturb, it is important to find their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">As treatment options, behavioural changes, a cognitive behavioural therapy or medications - classic sleep tablets only in exceptional cases and a maximum for two weeks - inquire.</seg>
<seg id="22">In Germany there is hardly ever underlines Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary-medical centre of the Charité University Hospital Berlin in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="23">That is why one should first turn to sleep problems at the homealogist, then Weeß.</seg>
<seg id="24">It may clarify, if the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to the sleep, and what happens there?</seg>
<seg id="26">For the investigation in the laboratory-laboratory, for example, in muffing with respiratory diseases, in case of illness, or if you don't find the cause of a break-disturb, explains Fietze.</seg>
<seg id="27">You do not have to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only please make no lunch," says Fibre.</seg>
<seg id="30">After gluing, one gets into the bed at its normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">In addition to the electrodes the body it carries a nose goggles, chest strap and a sensor on the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">The camera also features a camera on the ceiling to the sleeping.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can sufferers get the problems in the handle?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are fairly many positions on which one can set for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">Weeß counts on: regular sleep and standing times, not too long in bed, do not sleep to sleep, alcohol abstain from and at night not to the clock - then we begin to expect at once and that's all and not able to transport.</seg>

<seg id="3">On the façade of a grey house someone has "ugly!" sprayed.</seg>
<seg id="4">Opposite to a Lidl that will soon be demolished, it is already built: by 2017 there will be a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments.</seg>
<seg id="5">Article about this "trendy district," as the competent real estate company Friedrichshain, are described in the last weeks but preferred with burning cars.</seg>
<seg id="6">Reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, now the inhabitants of hire, on the ground floor are still rooms occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, in particular, in the beginning of the year, he had been responsible for a tough incident of the police against the project "No-Go-Zone" for policemen and 94 as a starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">After 22 June the rooms were vacated on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, with 300 police officers, the police arrested three weeks prior to official statements, with 30 to 40 civil servants and three car cars on site, locked parts of the road and kept visitor to enter the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, renovated building workers on behalf of unknown houseowner the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin administrative court decided that the clearance had been illegal, and a day later he moved police and workers under the Jubel of sympathizers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this summer afternoon the road acts peacefully: parents go with children, sit on the brush before the houses in the sun, others maintain vorm späti.</seg>
<seg id="12">A primary school and kindergartens are in close proximity to the hood projects.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left violence is not the main oracle of many others: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in the pines since 1999, and Jana *, who attracts three children, are above all of the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the residents of the skin projects, they share care of rising and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It doesn't sound to a pine, who wish to get more comfortable police protection from vandalating left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The trench, which the Berlin innensator and the police make up between domestic and their neighbours, does not exist so obvious.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the East of Berlin actually was a traditional workers' quarter that even today compared to the rest of the city a lower average income and high risk of poverty.</seg>
<seg id="18">Also home-occupied residential projects are already long to the pine trees: in 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire mainz street near the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer had been vacated among large police officers, many of the projects were legalized within the Rigaer and are still inhabited by people, which they occupied by the people 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the neighborhood has become increasingly becoming magnets for tourists and election liner from around the world: with them, residents from GDR times and former house occupied their pines.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also noticeable in rentals, which has risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols for this development: they detects them or freshly coated facades, that have been rejected with colour wraps.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other street was often mentioned this year together with the words "left-autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">A reason for that, not all the neighbours must have this as a problem that they are not affected by the criminality not affected: offences such as body injuries, statistics are almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">The largest part of the offenders make nonsense that tend to meet the new buildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives for 17 years in a rental house next to the controversial 94, cannot be any speech by uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">What violence goes, it is important: the people in the 94 are their neighbors who have not been destined.</seg>
<seg id="28">Also the famous burning cars will give it right in the Rigaer no longer.</seg>
<seg id="29">For which she studied Architectin, her street is no criminal law, on the contrary: "here one helps each other, lives together on the street and gets more of one another with what is different."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is deliberately drawn into the Rigaer street - stayed and stayed.</seg>
<seg id="31">That's why it was so important that the residents got up their street: from the police, politics and the media that all invoked the Deuthall on the district in July.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of residents such as Neugebauer, the street will continue to be taken away: new items in former building blocks that are excavated in old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "yes, the condominiums, which are not interesting for many here - here is more people who are not so good," "" "says it." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"violence and destruction can I not have gutheirs."</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should you do if any one listen to someone?</seg>
<seg id="36">Since all sides are frustration among all sides, also in the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">For jobs that were over paint bombs, Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: the skin projects and the left scene belonged to the pines.</seg>
<seg id="38">Who attracts, should be aware of it - exactly like a man who is in a paddle quarter, can be poorly complain about noise.</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuverle is a new refugee camp</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person in terms of integration and organisational.</seg>
<seg id="3">In addition, it is a social worker.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July, Annika Deuverle has been the refugee for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">Social pedagogue support the team of management at Achim Grozberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">It looks as a contact person for all stakeholders: refugees, working group assistance, authorities, authorities, and anyone else.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine customer stipulates that it is a volunteer more than thankbar that Deuverle now is, the harsh wok that has a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">So some - less spicy than rather than the multitude of unwishing tasks are targeted - meant when the administration wanted to write the place.</seg>
<seg id="9">We wanted a management force with a talent for languages and people, associated with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, just a harsh wok.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administration is not their central area, Annika Deuverle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is about organization, work with people on site and also behind the scenes as well as network activity.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been in existence for approximately six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">She has received a 50 percent position on three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was the highest time," says Regine customer that Annika Deuverle Honor and Public actors supported.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are large and small issues, organizational, human and understanding problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon new containers are located in the washer street</seg>
<seg id="17">It has been a serious problem since some time, the apartments have been recognized for the ploughs that have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The communes are responsible for the connection of the connection.</seg>
<seg id="19">They must accomodate the refugees in their own or rented rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The costs for the construction, the rent or renovation of this accommodation must bear the municipalities itself.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from Landratory and job centre.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not each owner will offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search have been very difficult for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto finds no private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">It didn't work until now, if you were interested in private apartments so Deuverle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, common ground must be infamous as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon, new containers are set up in the washer street.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, are rains and Annika Deuverle.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a fixed lead, there are practitioners, training places, training places, one-euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants who have to be found or arranged.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reported Regine customer.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help house master, complete nonprofit work - and motivated and very tidy, as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">It hopes that the work will lead to a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "that is" "" "no employment therapy" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">He does not only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day require a fixed structure, say Deuverle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People need to develop a impermeability.</seg>
<seg id="38">So do offers quotations like sports, contacts with local and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rar.</seg>
<seg id="40">So here's administration and honour.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is centrally located that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They have to explain the refugees that it takes about time to get the time of sense, for example, with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Anyone who would like to make sense, he could not work in Urbach, do not work, and be unprofitable, who will never integrate.</seg>
<seg id="45">The distinct majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"" "however, problems are honest," "" "people, at which nothing goes." "" "the work of Deuvert and customer is therefore always to motivate others." ""</seg>
<seg id="47">"" "this was a" "" "mammoth task" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: did the two after the recent incidents afraid of radicalization, also in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "says Regine customer" "" "says Regine customer" "" "what mancher can call it." "" "but a residual risk of it could not be missed." ""</seg>
<seg id="50">Sensipitizes the helper yet.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents were also theme in the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the makeepers will bring them completely in order.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine customer.</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So we have to look at the main and ambition from the location, and in the region after activities.</seg>
<seg id="56">They always have in the background that a new press to refugees and migrants may come to Urbach in the background.</seg>
<seg id="57">Needs Germany a upper limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">The policy is clear to answer this question.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually, it is unfair to set the helpers on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"" "" "" "we arrived not there where we would like," "" "says Annika Deuverle." ""</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would relax.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine client also makes clear that the urbacher could already be leached to integrate existing people.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently around 100 people, mainly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But when people in distress they have to help them, both women have one.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there is no simple answers.</seg>
