8 move values that show that Donald Tr@@ ump is seriously rep@@ ay .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have done it as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
however , no matter how some rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to move Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper edges at poll@@ s in poll@@ s , it does not work yet .
ten of the last eleven national surveys show Donald Tr@@ ump showed in the double @-@ digit range , and some start to ask seriously what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of the real estate business .
of course , it is too early in the election period .
nobody claims that Tr@@ ump probably won the republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts emphas@@ ize that this time in 2011 Rick Per@@ r@@ ys &apos;s leadership was given to the rising sales of Herman Cain , of which one won only one state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he had to fight in a general election .
however , external bus groups like J@@ eb Bus@@ h@@ s Super P@@ AC and the conservative Economic Group Club for Growth do now recognize Tr@@ um@@ ps through stamina and start to drop off their dollar to fall .
here are some current surveys show that the property Mog@@ ul is not only a temporary phase :
tr@@ um@@ ps popularity values have turned 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced its candidate in the middle of June , a survey from Mon@@ mouth University revealed that only two of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans have seen the real estate Mog@@ ul .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
in the beginning of August it had 52 percent .
now six out of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a positive opinion of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three of ten say that they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ p@@ ac vote in I@@ owa has established last week that 60 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two thirds of GO@@ P voters were happy with tr@@ ump as candidate .
in a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C the last week , 67 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , they were either &quot; excited &quot; or &quot; satisfied , &quot; when Tr@@ ump would be nominated .
only two of 10 say that they would be &quot; off@@ ended &quot; when he was the candidate .
only Ben Car@@ son makes about the same enthusiasm as tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they were &quot; excited &quot; vs. 40 per cent , who say the same about Tr@@ ump ) .
the next thing on passion ?
Marco Ru@@ bio is just 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 % of Republi@@ can voters say that they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; if J@@ thief Bush , the favorite of the Estonian candidate .
a majority of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans sees Tr@@ um@@ ps temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely adopted for his bom@@ bers and di@@ ligent statements , 52 per cent of which is to rep@@ ublic@@ s the rep@@ ublic@@ ans of Irish voters think that the real estate Mog@@ ul is the right temper@@ ament for a president so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is in the first country @-@ country of the nation , state , I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans think he has the personality to the commander , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent of the fact that he did not have the personality to execute judgment effectively and almost six out of 10 Independent saying that his temper@@ ament is not in the White House of P@@ asse , as ABC / Post .
Republi@@ can voters acc@@ ust@@ omed to the idea .
when they set up their vows , Republi@@ can voters hold Tr@@ ump for real .
if they &apos;re wonder@@ ing who wins the most recent GO@@ P nom@@ ination , say after a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C from last week four of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change since the time when four out of ten of July you were going to make money at J@@ eb Bush .
complete dis@@ closure : GO@@ P @-@ voters had not the clear crystal ball in the past .
at this point in the last cycle , four of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans started that Rick Perry won the nom@@ ination as opposed to only 28 % for final candidates .
nevertheless , there is a great variety of GO@@ P elec@@ tors Tr@@ um@@ ps campaign as pl@@ au@@ si@@ bly .
even if the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans gathered together for another candidate , Tr@@ ump has not beat any one .
some experts predi@@ ct that the spl@@ itter@@ ing field is likely to lead to Tr@@ um@@ ps leadership , while the anti @-@ Tr@@ ump support is diff@@ used by more than a dozen immig@@ rants .
but a survey from Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ thet@@ ical mind @-@ on @-@ head @-@ head between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump the majority support .
he has 13 points ahead of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points , before Walker 15 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before edge Paul , John Kas@@ i and Chris Christ@@ ie 33 points .
it is a head @-@ in @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who strikes him ?
Ben Car@@ son would surprise the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypo@@ thet@@ ical head @-@ head race .
a cris@@ py majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans says that they have made their mind .
a new C@@ BS / NY@@ T survey on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of voters want to support Tr@@ ump , say that they have firm their voices .
of course a lot can come to change that , and no one can really say , never change the opinion .
46 percent said that they would leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
however , Tr@@ um@@ ps is the strongest competition at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , neuro@@ sur@@ geon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who have formed her mind , are twice as frequent for tr@@ ump .
six out of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say they agree with Tr@@ ump on the topic of immig@@ ration .
since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign , two months ago , immig@@ rants from Mexico &quot; ra@@ p &quot; was the immig@@ ration and fishing point in the public dis@@ course in 2016 .
some are concerned that the bom@@ bers will dis@@ miss the opposition of Tr@@ ump decisive His@@ p@@ ano Americans from the Republi@@ can party and damage to re@@ orientation efforts .
but according to the new ABC / Post @-@ survey of Monday say six out of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans that they agree with Tr@@ ump on questions of immig@@ ration .
as long as the immig@@ ration remains in the ramp , Donald Tr@@ ump will apparently do it .
the fru@@ stration regarding the government clim@@ bs up to new high@@ s .
on Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son meanwhile , about half of the support of Republi@@ can voters falls from above all by its out@@ law@@ suits status .
six out of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ s in the new assembly survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a foreign out@@ sider as someone with government experience .
and they are also angry with Washington .
a pol@@ l of Des Mo@@ ines Register / Bloom@@ berg in I@@ owa conducted two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa rep@@ ublic@@ ans are fru@@ str@@ ated in Congress in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; hell@@ ish . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential sectors of Germany
here in Hob@@ oo@@ ken@@ weg you find the most expensive residential community - with a view over the North Sea .
the road costs 7@@ 3.@@ 300 euros on average in the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the syr@@ inge the offer is limited to objects &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it is stated in the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows which special layers costs one square meter most .
of course , 18,@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top holiday resorts , one of the prices will be such as pe@@ an@@ uts .
real estate provider Engel &amp; Ful@@ ler has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential sites - with square ex@@ alt@@ itudes in sh@@ al@@ ar@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of Euro nix - per square meter , well noticed .
but good , who can aff@@ ord it ...

Champions League : Bayern @-@ Dream Beginning thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
two @-@ times go@@ al@@ sc@@ orer in Pir@@ ate : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller made a run .
a happy suitable matches by Thomas Müller began the way to a earn 3 : 0 at the Olympi@@ ak@@ os Pir@@ ae@@ us - then ran it .
a su@@ prem@@ ely start of the Champions League @-@ season .
the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze have a dream launch in the &apos; Mission Milan &apos; at the &apos; Mission Milan &apos; at Pir@@ ate bo@@ ilers of Pir@@ ate .
the crew of coach P@@ EP Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won her debut game in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ak@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to a gar@@ bage double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and id@@ ol@@ es ( 8@@ 9th ) deserv@@ es with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth starter in series will be the first step towards the final on 28 May 2016 in Italy , where gu@@ ardi@@ ola will finally get to get the p@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t after Munich .
Müller was given to the Champions League to the Bavaria @-@ leadership kind of ten@@ d@@ care of the Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ go@@ al@@ keeper , who were going to pass a flange in the World Champion at the Olympic Champions League at the Olympic Champions of the World Champion .
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate it , &quot; Bayern @-@ captain Philipp Lah@@ m promised before the game in the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is Stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 , and the time that Munich counted word .
they presented a focused and committed screening without sh@@ one .
pir@@ ate had won his youngest six home games in the royal class , including the Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 , here also Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) are proud .
but Bavaria , which had overcome in seven Europ@@ ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek Teams , didn &apos;t want to be the next victim .
they went cour@@ age@@ ous , but often to eng@@ age in their obvious efforts .
the attacks were often managed by playing on left side Douglas Costa , who through the former Braun@@ schwei@@ ger Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ aou@@ i is rare through .
Müller gave his right more luck than his flan@@ ks from the right half @-@ field in the left upper gate .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the world champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best occasions in half had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first , when the Olympia @-@ stor@@ ms Brown was able to beat the head of the Pol@@ es on the line ( 26 ) .
then , with direct withdrawal , the ais@@ al@@ keeper met with the kne@@ e ( 3@@ 5. ) .
although the Bavaria had con@@ domin@@ ate her con@@ fer@@ ous game , Pir@@ ate was able to settle a needle &apos;s needle .
no . at Tor@@ ski@@ ter Manuel New was permitted .
so , when he ste@@ ered a shot from Ide@@ ye to the l@@ il@@ ds ( 5@@ 6. ) .
especially Gu@@ ardi@@ ola brought a quadru@@ ple with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , who made it well .
Mario Göt@@ ze , after mus@@ cular problems re@@ located at the rig , was sitting down outside .
the Cup of World Cup had only given the green light after the final start , he has said Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; who would like something different from it , that &apos;s already evil . &quot;
on his first change , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided to bear witness against him when he did the King@@ sley Com@@ an for the nom@@ inees Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59@@ th ) .
the go@@ ze came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6. ) and made it clear 13 minutes later , by El@@ m@@ meter , Müller was still playing .
before the game it was come to the stadium to Kra@@ j .
after a smaller group of partly prevented Bavaria fans in their audience @-@ block showed the fans of hosts Pir@@ ate with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces attacked and triggered with impact resistance against the Munich tra@@ ilers .
at least a Bavaria @-@ Fan was transported from the stadium .
who har@@ sh , has a higher risk to lose teeth
those who rough , not only the lungs , but also the teeth - this puts a Pots@@ damer Platz study nearby .
good news : when aband@@ oning , the risk is rapidly reduced .
smo@@ kers have a clearly increased risk to lose their teeth early .
this is from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several staff members of the German Institute for Food Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smoking holes in smo@@ kers , the risk of losing their teeth was pen@@ ed in order to match the 2.@@ 5- up to 3.6 @-@ F@@ ache .
scientists had observed more than 23,@@ 300 participants .
main causes for denti@@ als may be c@@ aries and inflamm@@ ation of the g@@ um , st@@ resses the DI@@ O .
for this peri@@ od@@ ont@@ itis , smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ize the authors .
the connection between smoking and denti@@ sts go back to frequent infl@@ amed g@@ ums in smo@@ kers .
not clear why smoking also increases the risk of c@@ aries .
people who stopped using smoking could reduce their risk in a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
however , it could take over ten years to continue to the level of will@@ ing@@ ness to the level of non @-@ smoking , the first Emperor Thomas Dietrich , of the English University of Birmingham .
if one had to convince people to be dis@@ regarded as non @-@ smo@@ ker , there was a Boeing type from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking shortened the lifetime . &quot;
not smoking is good for lungs and containers and runs according to our in@@ sights as well as to great health until the age .
in Germany , more than 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 were also affected by Zah@@ us@@ ement , including DI@@ O .
earlier studies have already noted that smoking reaches the risk of early dental loss .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ cover the findings .

EU Commission proposes a new court in battle via TT@@ IP
the EU Commission proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ rators , which proposed the scheduled trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement TT@@ IP .
the controversi@@ al private screening equipment for disp@@ utes between corpor@@ ations and states must therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which is clearly more traditional dishes in its operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to trust a system that trust the citizen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the competent European Commissioner for Cec@@ ilia had designed this performance at the performance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Swe@@ din before introducing the proposal as a European negoti@@ ating position into the Free Trade Report to the USA .
the German Government has announced support .
TT@@ IP is expected to present the world &apos;s largest free trade zone with 800 million people .
plans to reform current arbit@@ ration procedure will clearly see that the EU states and the U.S. have established independent judges on a new investment in the United States .
that is to equal parts from the EU , the USA and the third states .
for the first time it is also a second instance .
it would allow it to rise to judgments obj@@ ection .
so far , the rules agreed between each arbit@@ rator , a g@@ im@@ aging possibility against their sentences , did not exist .
in the discussion of the past months , it became clear that people did not believe the old IS@@ DS system in the fair@@ ness and justice .
in the long term , it wants to work on an international investment court .
there could then be disp@@ utes between Chinese companies and EU countries , for example .
in particular , the major reasons for the major infr@@ in@@ gement @-@ arbit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) will apply as one of the main reasons for the major resistance in Europe against TT@@ IP .
the traditional bit@@ ration cards are critic@@ ized by opponents as a sort of parall@@ el@@ ci@@ on , reaching the compensation plans of the tax@@ pay@@ ers , national laws or a reduction of consumer and environmental standards .
in the initial opinions , anti @-@ TT@@ IP organizations such as Camp@@ act has identified the proposals by the EU Commission as in@@ adequate .
in particular , the trade agreements with Canada ( CE@@ TA ) was supposed to be considered for the already negoti@@ ated trade agreement with Canada .
the German Business Secretary from Matthias F@@ nig ( SPD ) states his projects as a great progress .
the Commission noted for the reform of key points , the Federal Minister for Energy Sig@@ mar Gabriel received from the spring with other EU trading ministers in the spring .
the old system of private arbit@@ ration is from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of comm@@ it@@ ments .
before that , the European business association Business@@ Europe war@@ ned that the economy should restri@@ ct the economy to limit a lot of new rules .
particularly small and medium @-@ sized enterprises might be ad@@ mi@@ red in this way , the name was meant .
when talks concluded the free trade agreement TT@@ IP ( Tran@@ sat@@ lan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) , the discussions remained un@@ clear on Wednesday .
the negotiations are running since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the subject of investment protection has not been discussed with the USA .

dol@@ phin Folk of Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens in Hamburg
11 years ago Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens sits on stage at the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Luxor ) .
in addition to him , a fli@@ p@@ chart is on which the sh@@ y @-@ acting Fol@@ ks@@ änger was recorded by the picturesque U.S. state of Michigan with felt @-@ tip pen .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost caught by Stev@@ ens .
he tells of different places that he has always explained on the map to report about his min@@ u@@ ously and z@@ art arranged songs .
where they were born , and what it looks like , in his house .
since that Stev@@ ens has been regarded as mira@@ cul@@ ous creative Irish .
with the 2003 and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake State &quot; clearly explained songs which makes it harmon@@ ically very close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , but can dri@@ fting at any time in the great op@@ ul@@ ent .
it is the rum@@ our , &quot; Michigan &quot; would be the first part of a se@@ per@@ ate series : each of the 50 US states that should be possessed in a row .
but already in 2004 and near the proximity of the Rhine , &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; had been released and had a positive result .
reduced to Stev@@ ens here .
live for him guitar and ban@@ jo .
one year later , the musician returns to the series in New York .
with &quot; Illinois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens Inv@@ ite You To : come on Fe@@ el The Th@@ ank , &quot; ) released 2005 a widespread master piece .
du@@ b@@ ating on ideas and sty@@ li@@ stic fin@@ esse .
the album is entering the American Bill@@ board charts and is missing in any year and not enough chart of the influ@@ ential music media .
after an extremely productive experiment , Stev@@ ens then served on &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) extensively with electronic temp@@ o .
this sixth ordinary studio album is still widely orchest@@ rated , but performed by program sequences or be@@ ats and plays with all the effect and rever@@ b .
long ago the smaller club went off and shows the set shows here for colorful spect@@ acle , from Neon @-@ nose gl@@ ands and large fluorescent stage decoration .
currently Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens is as part of a five member band .
in the dark presence of Hamburg there is more !
he mainly presents the &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; since March , available in March .
although there are almost 2000 guests to sit in their chairs , the clearly advert@@ ised Stev@@ ens returns to the in@@ tim@@ acy and folk .
without a word to the audience , the group &apos;s excellent musician doesn &apos;t play through the wide @-@ enrich@@ ed album .
from the audience , one hears : &quot; the lecture is &quot; op@@ ul@@ ent &quot; and you could throw away the &quot; record in this fundament@@ ally . &quot;
just to an addition , Stev@@ ens hum@@ ble himself plays audi@@ ble and plays an acoustic few older songs and ultimately ten@@ ds to st@@ ating appl@@ ause .
Jeremy Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s debut at the prime minister of the Prime Minister
since its election , Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s has been successful in the prime minister by the Prime Minister with exc@@ itement
the new Labour MEP Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n will take his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s reaction and set David Cameron for the first time .
M@@ R Cor@@ by@@ n is up to raise the first of his six given questions shortly after mid@@ day , with his performance from the media , possibly the Labour MEP and the Labour MEP .
he called &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could ski@@ p a couple of meetings to leave them colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s leadership , since she came to his appointment as a member of the Sch@@ atten@@ dence Court and following his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
in the meantime , during a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence has prov@@ oked a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , and stands out of a number of tri@@ bun@@ ny stories in the newspapers .
M@@ R Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s decision , not to sing national an@@ them , has attention to itself
a spokes@@ man of Mr Cor@@ bit@@ n said that he had stood &quot; in resp@@ ect@@ ful silence &quot; and was recognized the hero@@ ic book of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England .
but a member of Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s Sch@@ atten@@ u@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told in the BBC Two News@@ night programme , he became to sing the Labour leader , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy must be abolished .
almost a dozen of sh@@ adows have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s top team , and she calls herself on differences in business , defence and foreign policy , while in less than one sixth of the Parliamentary Party war@@ es him as leader .
the Political Cor@@ respon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t said that political differences may also stap@@ le in Labour &quot; and indeed to Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s comments on the position of the European Union and the limitation with win@@ nings .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference to make the right to remove all the idea of a limit in total .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow @-@ working and pen@@ sions @-@ minister , said that the party is &quot; very clear &quot; that they only applies to the government plans to reduce the limit of 26@@ ,000 pounds on 23@@ ,000 pounds .
M@@ R Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader , David Cameron , but ever since he has T@@ ory CEO , in the last decade , over the Dis@@ patch box in parliament stands out .
the Labour Board , who promised another policy principle , said that he has donated the &quot; C@@ row@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced ideas for questions to Mr. Cameron and given more than 30.000 suggestions .
the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the fra@@ cture of the Prime Minister is con@@ front@@ ally and that it has been subjected to both &quot; stroke &quot; and the Stre@@ am@@ ites with resist@@ ors and to serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the Shadow of the Economic @-@ Minister is represented by him if he is not participating - for example if Mr. Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also brought up the idea into conversation , that other colleagues ev@@ okes the word , and that he spoke John Ber@@ sh , spokes@@ man of the lower house , talked about the problem .
when he was leaders in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he would also remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Kas@@ per le Theatre &quot; that is often associated with the fra@@ cture of the Prime Minister . but a few years later he brought it back in it .
when she was first broadcast in television in 1990 , the fra@@ gment with the Prime Minister is considered to be the most important barometer of the leadership of a leader and his position under his parliamentary elections , although critics have argu@@ ed that it had become a car@@ ic@@ ature and deliber@@ ately endor@@ sed re@@ forms .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the Managing Director of J@@ D Sports Peter C@@ ow@@ g@@ ill said that a higher minimum wage for UK worker is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is un@@ likely that this buying power will say the higher labor costs in his company , he says .
the costs might meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs .

met@@ ering starts floor @-@ fr@@ ying campaign campaign to fight Al@@ di@@ - In@@ fall
I had to get Met@@ cash to protect the IG@@ A branch in front of a Al@@ di invasion in South Australia and Western Australia .
food whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers Met@@ cash has started a fr@@ aud@@ itable campaign to protect the market share of IG@@ A retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di prepar@@ es the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia in early next year , strengthen Met@@ cash and IG@@ A supermarkets to their relationships with local food supplier and build the IG@@ A brand by ma@@ inst@@ re@@ am marketing and marketing across the social media , as well as via events such as Adelaide Show .
IG@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as E@@ autom@@ aker Simm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who in IG@@ A @-@ shops samples distributed and shop owners who sell tickets for the South Australian soccer league with faithful customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash added more details of his defense strategy on 29 September when the wholesale distributors for food , alcohol and equipment is continuing through an annual investors strategy .
it is much on the game , da South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A shop @-@ shops and generate higher profit mar@@ gins as Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A network in eastern states .
buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ e@@ worthy provincial market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia in comparison with about 14 percent in eastern Australia .
however , an@@ alysts like Morgan Stanley is that Al@@ di twelve months after opening its first markets , approximately five percent of the food market in these two states will gra@@ b and all existing ac@@ ters , but mainly separate single retailers .
a report that published in this week according to Morgan Stanley , analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stanley reported that IG@@ A retailers can lose a $ 360 million turnover annually and in met@@ a cash from $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this forecast is based on the assum@@ ption that Al@@ di will have 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA , and will generate revenue of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in the food and grocery store and at the quantities of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s a high fixing base could cost Met@@ cash about $ 13 million in pre @-@ tax and tax , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , met@@ a market share will lose market share in the eastern states , mainly to Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recently realised conducted by Roy Morgan that IG@@ A buyers are the closest thing .
Morgan Stanley is participating that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s turnover in the food and market grew by 3.8 per cent in 2016 , 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and its market share will drop from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told everyone in Melbourne , that Met@@ cash is likely to disappear within a decade .
Met@@ al@@ cash rejected it publicly to respond to the comments by Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a board member of the board of Met@@ ert has entered contact Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
IG@@ As market share has fallen by 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and income from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Di@@ etary and Food Trading , which has been around 1,200 percent since 2012 , refle@@ cting its operating profit reduction in the same pressure on revenue and mar@@ gins .
the wholesale dealers gets lost , however , investing more than 150 million dollars to sell sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ li@@ ze at hundreds of products every week and IG@@ A single retailers to improve their disposal by faster growing food products and provide a better choice of private @-@ label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s main managing director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and loading programs to grow and hopes to return to a profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years .
Tan@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian Tennis Association Steve He@@ aly .
than@@ k@@ co@@ k@@ ak@@ is deserv@@ es more praise than cr@@ iti@@ que for his behaviour .
Than@@ asi Ko@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ateral damages &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick K@@ yr@@ illi@@ es and deserv@@ es the view of president of the Australian tennis tournament Steve He@@ aly rather praise to his own behaviour .
co@@ ca@@ ine is the younger of talented Du@@ os , which is always identified as &quot; Special KS &quot; by the inf@@ am@@ ous strug@@ gles of K@@ yr@@ gios works with St@@ an WA@@ W@@ R@@ IN@@ KA in the Montreal master at the r@@ amps .
in a fier@@ y qualification in Cinc@@ inn@@ ati shortly thereafter had to be separated with Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ry@@ an Har@@ rison twice through the arbit@@ rator , where Har@@ rison had to beat fellow at Har@@ rison : &quot; WA@@ W@@ R@@ IN@@ KA would sm@@ ite the child , and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was last seen how he cr@@ ushed a tennis ra@@ cket after a cr@@ amp@@ f was a potential US Open victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , co@@ ca@@ ine was def@@ ended from He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is presently in Glasgow , in competition with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against Great Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing that I looked pretty much more about me is the fact that after my view Than@@ asi was stri@@ pped little into the dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken a ra@@ cket , as he lost due to a cr@@ amp@@ er in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has cr@@ ushed a ra@@ cket of fru@@ ition itself , and I know Than@@ asi is good enough to know that he is not proud of them .
but , really , he has looked at the US Open extremely well , even under the fairly pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances of Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserv@@ es a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around itself , he has a great family around itself , and I think he was treated a little too strictly .
he is a very hard 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he is still working with the other players , he is trained hard , he is well in the form , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserv@@ es it to be judged based on his own services .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to take into account the decision to take into account the decision on Friday , and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right choice for everyone , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term fixed component into the team . &quot;
&quot; first we wish that the team is completely concentr@@ ating on the competition , and not all around the contro@@ vers@@ eness &#91; K@@ yr@@ berg &#93; , &quot; said He@@ aly .
and I believe Nick meets the asc@@ ension of people as Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray . he goes up in the eyes of the public and he gets trying to under@@ stand@@ able it . but some time outside the ramp , in which he can think only about it , I think it is best for the team and it is best for the team and it is best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares a not@@ ion , conclu@@ des refugees
Hungary declared the not@@ stand and locking the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held fast , the tried to come illeg@@ ally in the country . everything with the goal to stop the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos was followed on the border , as hundreds of migrants arrested in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and re@@ acted with indig@@ nation .
people who have fled prior to violence , for an unknown time in a land strip on the road between the two control points of the countries , and built tents and settled there .
but fru@@ str@@ ations continued .
as a police helicopter above them suspended the migrants &quot; Open the fron@@ tier ! &quot; and they cried al@@ oud to the Hungarian bom@@ bers . &quot;
some meadows up Protest and Water .
in Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister , it was &quot; un@@ acceptable &quot; that migrants should withdraw from Hungary , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive .
( Serbia ) intends to become part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral damage .
we must take place in the coming days of talks with Brussels and other countries , &quot; Iv@@ ica D@@ ac@@ ic said in Prague .
the tur@@ mo@@ il under the Hungarian @-@ Serb border came one day after the 28 @-@ Nations @-@ block at a str@@ ati@@ al meeting in Brussels to settle for joint migration policy .
the ministers agreed to condemn the responsibility for 40,000 people who died in the over@@ ump@@ ed Italy and Greece . they afflicted their hope that eventually - next month or until the end of the year - an agreement would have more than 120,000 refugees , including some of Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on Tuesday a Special Summit of the European Union to discuss the migration crisis of the continent .
Hungary failed however , its hopes for a bal@@ ancing action of Brussels or from his neigh@@ bors .
on Tuesday , the emergency in two southern regions , authorities gave more powers to conquer the crisis , so that they could spe@@ c streets and spe@@ eded up asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister , Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ ar@@ to said that his country also had the construction of a bar@@ bed wire along its border to Romania , to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after it ended a fence at the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News Cor@@ respon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison quarters were used in running , bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in the past few months , Hungary has become a large number of war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East , to a significant bott@@ len@@ eck and the entrance point to the European Union .
Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban , however , insi@@ sted that most popular economic refugees who are looking for a better life , and non @-@ war refugees , which are entitled to protect against other EU states , including Germany .
the new laws , which came into force at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or damaged by the 4 @-@ metre ( 13 ft ) hei@@ gh@@ ted gate to Serbia , to judge Serbia along the southern border with Serbia . these laws also provide higher st@@ ing@@ encies for human tra@@ ff@@ ic@@ kers .
&quot; due to the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government declared the emergency , &quot; said government spokes@@ man Z@@ olt@@ an K@@ ov@@ acs repor@@ ters in the southern town of Sz@@ eged .
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament must still agree on the use of the military , which is expected for next week , but repor@@ ter of Associated Press have already seen armed soldiers with cars and dogs .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country @-@ security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities 45 people were trying to cross the border , 15 others were down deeper into the country .
they come across , by dam@@ aging the sp@@ ells , they are now in custody to the custody and of being accused of criminal off@@ ences against the new laws .
authorities are to repair the fence .
on Tuesday morning , two of the seven border trans@@ itions with Serbia , after a car with bar@@ bed wire in order to close the fron@@ tier had arrived .
chaos converted the main border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and pressed a crowd in order to push it out there .
approximately 20 managed to get in , but thousands remained outside .
a further group of migrants attemp@@ ting the main highway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse to travel food and water until they travel to Hungary .
election 2016 : Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s lead to Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey
former US Secretary of State Hill@@ ary Clinton continues to keep a double @-@ digit advance in the democratic race for the nom@@ ination of national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins on the ground .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of democratic voters during pre @-@ elections ( 58 per cent previously ) , while S@@ anders is standing second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
Vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced for the president &apos;s office , receives support of 15 percent of democratic voters of the parliamentary elections .
more than five months before the start of the elections , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion can define which candidates are supported .
but Clin@@ t supporters are in their choice more resistant than those of the other candidates .
the C@@ BS News survey has lost Clinton in a number of demo@@ graphic groups while S@@ anders achieved a few gains .
Clinton is holding a big lead of women and moder@@ ates , but this approach have decreased .
her support for men has dropped shar@@ ply , and S@@ anders is only 5 with 5 points .
Clin@@ t advantage for democratic voters under 50 years of age have become sin@@ ning , and they are now at the same height .
Clinton has , however , has a big lead over the older voters .
in the past month , Clinton used two @-@ digit head with the liber@@ als , but S@@ differently has a 5 @-@ point advantage for this group .
approximately half of the democratic voters of the parliamentary elections say that they would support Clinton &apos;s Clinton when they were nominated by the party .
one quarter would support them with some examples and 15 percent would support them only because they are the candidate .
they would not support six percent .
maybe not surprising that Clin@@ t current supports current supporters above all of them .
the views are stronger than those who have currently not support Clinton - only a quarter would help it thr@@ illed .
while 48 percent of democratic voters will say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republi@@ can voters want from its top speed Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
when Clinton &apos;s supporters in an open question is asked why they want the candidate to choose the correct answer ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time is that a woman president is president ( 13 percent ) and that it is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
from Clinton &apos;s supporters , their connection is mentioned with Bill Clinton ( 9 per cent ) .
approval for handling of the problems and elec@@ ability are also quoted .
since the vice president th@@ rows an potential for the President of the Order , 57 per cent of democratic voters want to see him in the race - though a third has believed that he should not do it .
when democratic voters are required by the parliamentary elections , who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den will be on top .
from Clin@@ t tra@@ ilers say more than half that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far from S@@ anders .
if bee decided not to de@@ di@@ ct the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton boo@@ sted its lead to 30 points with be@@ den in the race at 30 points without him in the race .
fifty @-@ five percent of democratic voters will see Clinton &apos;s candidate with the best chances of winning the choice ; however , this figure has fallen by 78 per cent in the last month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bi@@ den has a second at this measurement , but the percentage that has seen him as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; selectable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has risen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , in question , what is more important at a candidates , refer to the voters &quot; voters above the elec@@ torate .
similarly to the last month a single demo@@ c@@ rat@@ ory candidate or a potential candidate for these voters were not acceptable as un@@ acceptable .
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates produce good results with some important characteristics in elec@@ tors of the party .
multi@@ ples consider Clinton , S@@ anders and be@@ den as a hon@@ est and tru@@ st@@ worthy and strong lead qualities .
bi@@ kers cuts out best at the top three candidates in terms of hon@@ esty while Clin@@ t &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty per cent of democratic voters think not believe that Clinton is hon@@ est@@ ly and trusted , twice as many say that over S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion about him .
Democratic voters of the elections are generally Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ological in accordance with their views .
in all these measurements , about one @-@ quarter of the democratic voters don &apos;t have any opinion of S@@ anders .
since questions of Hill@@ ary Clinton used to use a personal email address and server during the term as an Secretary of State , most of the key voters were satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that their opinions does not affect altogether .
but it &apos;s a different story in the American public .
half of the Americans are dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about one @-@ third is satisfied .
the public opinion of this was in March , shortly after the problem arrived .
most Americans say that the e @-@ mail has no effect on their overall opinions of Clinton , although 36 percent said that their minds will be deterior@@ ated .
there are mainly Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say that their views are worse by Clinton .
although Clinton is regarded as the hon@@ est and tru@@ st@@ worthy market , it is still a problem for them under registered voters . only 32 percent see them as hon@@ est and trusted , eight percent less than in the last month and 15 points less since May .
62 % of voters are not entitled to an hon@@ our@@ able and tru@@ st@@ worthy person .
at the same time 55 percent of the nation &apos;s entitled shareholders also show Tr@@ ump as non @-@ hon@@ est and not tru@@ st@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump get good notes in the lead .
of the six tested candidates , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush best at Hon@@ esty .
a majority looks rather hon@@ est@@ ly rather than hon@@ est@@ ly but as with Car@@ son there have no opinion about him .
the error rate for the overall sample of 351 Democratic voters were 6 percentage points for the previous elections .
Ben Car@@ son res@@ oun@@ ds near Donald Tr@@ ump on a nationwide survey close to Donald Tr@@ ump
Ben Car@@ son is in the latest survey from C@@ BS News / New York Times closely behind Donald Tr@@ ump
on the two candidates , half of the support of voters falls in the new survey , and others will lose dramatically .
Republi@@ can voters support nationwide in@@ ump in large numbers . the support is achieved by 23 % in the last month C@@ BS survey carried out ahead of Fox News Deb@@ ate in the survey on Tuesday .
but Car@@ son resulted in the same period from 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son is near at demo@@ graphic groups and has sur@@ passed Tr@@ ump in republi@@ can voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio @-@ Govern@@ or John Kas@@ ich , is beaten with Wis@@ con@@ sins Govern@@ or Scott Walker , which is the deep@@ est , and from 10 % support in the last month to now 2 % .
the former Florida governor J@@ eb Bush , the former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ sas Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida @-@ Senator Marco Ru@@ bio are 6 % on the third place .
the error occurs in the sample of 376 persons of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was carried out in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , which was published last week , shows that Car@@ son increases in the poll@@ s - with 19 % support for the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , behind the ump with 32 % support .
the most recent survey of ABC News / Washington Post showed Tr@@ ump clearly before Car@@ son .
at a glance at one in the last week of rising Car@@ son , Tr@@ ump found some side hi@@ es for the former neuro@@ surgery , even after Car@@ son decided to ap@@ ologi@@ ze to compos@@ e Tr@@ um@@ ps belief in question .
&quot; we need energy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump last Saturday during a campaigns in I@@ owa .
pleasant bath @-@ temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
also , if peak values are measured only in distance , enough for bathing people already find a trip to the Mediterranean to still find hot water .
a bathroom in the north or Baltic Sea may be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
maneu@@ ver , there is no more to the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees left the water in the North and Baltic Sea in this week , the German weather forecast ( D@@ WD ) .
after the end of the Mediterranean climate there is still the Mediterranean : there are even up to 29 degrees in the east .
in the Adriatic Sea , it peaks at 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood drawn to the death of a Baruch @-@ College Ne@@ ul@@ ings
almost two years after a student in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died when a student at Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , will lament for a complaint against five people .
in September 2013 , members of New York Baruch , P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si bro@@ therhood handles Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during the introduction to the hospital in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death .
official said that he had been stressed with related eyes with a 30 pound back@@ pack full of sand , and repeatedly was attacked while trying to go through a frozen field to achieve a frozen field .
after all , Mr. Den@@ g mour@@ ned about head@@ ache , then he fell un@@ conscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ bro@@ therhood did not call the emergency number 911 after den@@ ounces and waited an hour before they brought him into a hospital , so the police seized him .
but they had the time to switch D@@ eng@@ s clothes , to contact his symptoms , and Andy Men@@ g , to contact the national President of the Brotherhood to call advice , said police officers Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; at this point , members of the members of U@@ ten@@ sil@@ ia started to hide and put the bro@@ therhood in principle over the Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said police officers Wagner .
he could not revi@@ ved himself , and he died in the next morning to his injuries .
after a aut@@ op@@ sy report den@@ otes Den@@ g repeatedly were added to head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh@@ s to the head .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the ch@@ ic@@ ans of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies on the ch@@ ic@@ ans , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer , who tre@@ ats your family in a declaration .
fra@@ ction and its members must be drawn to the account , and this step by authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury of Monroe Doc@@ ahl receive an indictment for murder of the third five members .
two and thirty members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged with obli@@ que attacks and education to a criminal organization .
&quot; we don &apos;t want only the involved person responsible , but if there are an organization that has - officially or un@@ officially - this will do so , we will also refer to this account , &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday .
the Baruch College has banned the bro@@ therhood and the national Brotherhood has sum@@ mon@@ ed its affili@@ ation to the local government .
that will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest
an interest increase comes , and the house will retreat into the wan@@ ing , yields , and the economy will lead into recession .
we know that .
what we do not know how long will it take and how long it is about to keep it .
in particular , the history of the economy does only offer low guidance for the process .
there came a recession within just 11 months after the first interest rate and lasted 86 months .
the aggressi@@ vity of the Federal Reserve at the lifting of interest rates is often , if it is not always a factor of how the economy and financial investments are react .
as a result , representative of the U.S. Central Bank strongly emphas@@ ised that investors should not concentrate on how they begin to increase interest rates , but rather to the period which is needed for norm@@ alization .
in fact , several variables play a role .
in the end , market participants could notice that the whole exc@@ itement was probably ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated due to an increase in interest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will be interpreted in@@ sof@@ ter from some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cheap money , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Julian J@@ ess@@ op , Chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication of customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradu@@ al return of US interest to normal heights , but still at low level , to process the seism@@ ic shock , which seem to be fear .
however , this does not mean that there will be no effect .
here is a view of historical trends based on how some areas of the economy might be react :
as the market has seen in the last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases things for a while .
as soon as the increase occurs , the impact is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apparently there is a tendency to reflect &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wealth income 12 to 24 months after the first increase , possibly refle@@ cting the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Deutsche Bank An@@ alysts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said in a newer study to what has happened after interest increases the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , in the past 35 years , the market is mostly in upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to interest increase , fairly flat in the 250 days after a recent analysis that Bob D@@ oll , chief system strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , was released at Bar@@ ron &apos;s asset management .
the Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares ten@@ ds later in the final cycle , and the return begins to decrease .
recipes are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote them .
in the current case the F@@ ed is con@@ fron@@ ted with some conditions that it didn &apos;t even speed up a recession .
it is extremely remarkable that the gross domestic product is in the proximity of their lowest point at an interest increase of F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , 118 interest rates since 1950 was only twice the nominal GDP below 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , there are only few that this would be lasting and expected to wait approximately 1.5 percent for the third quarter .
interest increases in so frag@@ ile economic back@@ drop and throwing the question , &quot; whether it is different this time , &quot; Deutsche Bank said .
market participants have made all the year on an interest increase of F@@ ed , and all eyes were fixed at the Federal Open Market Committee in this week that ends on Thursday .
while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC could increase an increase in this session , the fut@@ ures trade is only a probability of 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all enh@@ ances cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing moment@@ um during GDP and pre @-@ recipes provided very quickly after the start of recovery in the sh@@ adows . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is definitely a lon@@ ely recovery of what the worst recession in the observed phase was .
the current cycle is far the longest that has been waiting since the end of the last recession , the record was 35 months and these have been 74 months .
this solid income was also vol@@ ati@@ l because the market takes a interest increase , and the pattern was quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than in stock , when they change their strategic course .
the bonds seem to change the direction as soon as the first increase / cut in the cycle is performed .
at the end of the final cycle , the Germans are exp@@ ire , the Deutsche Bank said .
the strateg@@ ists of Charles Schw@@ ab believed that the rise in interest rates will result that yields vary between longer and shorter bonds , and lead to a fl@@ aming of the curve .
highly @-@ consuming bonds often bring better yields , even though &quot; we &apos;re still careful to expect higher income , &quot; said Cath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come @-@ An@@ alysts at Schw@@ ab , in an analysis .
the markets also said that the markets have already adapted to f@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides the thickness of the dollar and the decline in inflation , there are some evidence that the market has adapted to the prosp@@ ect of stric@@ ter monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the Er@@ mit@@ sk@@ ur@@ ve has risen , ac@@ y@@ makers , credit lines have risen , and the volume has risen - all the characteristics of the market if the F@@ ed its strategy are tigh@@ tened .
throughout the large and whole company , businesses will wrap up the major part of their business activities in the USA , including interest rates and local products are more attractive .
multin@@ ational corpor@@ ations with high debts are worse , as an increase of dollars is more expensive on the global market and the financing of their debts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares ten@@ dering extremely positive three months after an initial investment increase , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ man Sachs @-@ An@@ alysts said in a report to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with a strong balance sheet , companies with a weak balance after each of the interest increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 increased by 5 percentage points .
with high capital expenditure as well as low Vol@@ at@@ il@@ ity , their shares over@@ took their counter@@ parts at an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts are a great problem .
company with a high proportion of flexible interest will lose most , Gold@@ man said .
outside the pure stock of stock , consumers also will also benefit through the increasing dollar .
savings could see gains due to higher yields , even if experts are held , how fast that will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , &quot; says parliamentary committee Andrew B@@ ingham
the conservative member of the Parliament critic@@ ised the transmitter for his &quot; stup@@ id &quot;
he argu@@ ed that he is not increasingly different to distingu@@ ish some commercial ri@@ vals .
he also moved to BBC Music Awards and said that she just im@@ ited The Br@@ its
music @-@ Colle@@ ge Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins took the broadcast The Voice and said that this is not very original .
BBC Radio 3 &quot; turns into classic FM , a leading member of parliament and raises new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does something like the private sender .
the conservative MEP Andrew B@@ ingham also said the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen that the publicly dis@@ mis@@ sil@@ ent radio broadcast &quot; would be &quot; stup@@ id &quot; and increasingly won no more of its commercial cont@@ enders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 appears - I do not use the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stup@@ id &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it seems to transform into classic FM &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also moved to the BBC Music Awards , which began in December last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which began in the year , appear to appear only under another name .
so , if you are trying to do something else - these are two spont@@ ane@@ ously mentioned examples , where you only have to quote what has already been on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said .
BBC @-@ General Director confirmed the alleg@@ ations and argu@@ ed that BBC Radio 3 went far ahead of its commercial compet@@ itor when it comes to live music and ligh@@ ten@@ ment .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I &apos;ll learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and to give the commitment of Radio 3 , new music , and give new works in order , I really hold for important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey decided that har@@ der to work to eng@@ age the audience as it did in the past , because the British had not informed about classical music .
radio 3 , however , was not the only element of BBC production which , during the hearing in the committee for the selection of culture , media and sport , was under fire , to tr@@ ample on the commercial ri@@ vals .
the T@@ ory @-@ MP Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins touched The Voice - the musical talent of the BBC , which was bought by Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated cost of $ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not especially prominent ?
LORD Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show was produced on the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as judge - &quot; a special BBC way . &quot;
he added , he would like that the company &quot; find &quot; a hit from our in @-@ house stable , &quot; when it star@@ red for the next time .
however , he refused to exp@@ el the order from the Voice of The Voice in the future or to give money the comm@@ it@@ ators for other entertainment formats .
Internet sales grew in August , and the Black Friday can be responsible for this .
in the first three months of 2015 there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month the lowest result has been recorded since the start of the records in 2000 .
online sales intensi@@ fied three years ago by using mobile phones to buy used
experts believe that the Black Friday has slow@@ ed down in November .
for over one decade , the virtual shopping street has curved and many of the main shopping streets in Great Britain has turned into cl@@ ut@@ ids .
but experts say that it is now signs that online sales stag@@ n@@ ating after new numbers showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest growth in growth since the start of records in 2000 with just five percent increase from the previous year .
experts predi@@ ct that there are signs that advance online sales after new numbers showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you consider the growth rates for the previous years and follow it until 2000 , &quot; Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , &quot; said , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ RG sale of the Guardian .
it declared that the online sales began three years ago , when it began to work with their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , such as home on the sofa .
but now it is a comm@@ enting on us and we will experience that growth will be reduced .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon , which was imported from America , is quoted as a reason for the resulting revenues .
experts believe that buyers will hold its purchases before this event , which will take place on the last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers around their computer to make her bar@@ gain , and some tra@@ ders of dealers come down .
experts believe that Black Friday , in which the buyers had fought for bar@@ gain , buyers could stop for purchases .
a study by the British Ret@@ ail Con@@ sortium have found that out of 5 £ expenditure a little more than £ 1 was issued online .
some products such as television and washing machines are now carried out more than one @-@ third of purchases on web @-@ shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of in the mo@@ dec@@ ine in the inner fields .

it claims that British do their hamm@@ ers and brush in favour of the use of qualified eastern European tra@@ des@@ people who perform work in their home .
if you are sk@@ ill@@ ful with a hammer or a brush to wear walls , you are nowadays belong to a minority in nowadays .
for Britain increasingly employ workers to conduct home jobs at their houses , so the chief of the company behind B &amp; Q .
V@@ é@@ ron@@ ique L@@ ry , new managing director of King@@ F@@ isher , who owns the DIY range , said that a large increase in the number of skilled workers made from Eastern Europe to provide services to civil prices have meanwhile been overhau@@ led .
in this way , King@@ F@@ isher also plans to open 200 further screens of screens which make up of tra@@ des@@ men and 60 sales points of B &amp; Q .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said to employ more women in B &amp; Q stores , since eight of ten department decisions in the shop become hit by women .

she said it was necessary to exhibit the growing demo@@ graphic trends , which have more women &apos;s single households to make more renovation than in the past .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it is still working with a majority of men in our branches .
we need to move this stronger to balance .
basically , half of our clients are made from women with 80 percent of all decisions regarding the purchase of articles by women .
women plays a major role in the decision process .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women on the top of a British in F@@ T@@ SE@@ 100 index , has also enc@@ ir@@ ate its top team to reflect a same number of men and women in man@@ ag@@ erial positions .

officials from A@@ I / DO@@ B because of un@@ faith@@ fulness
on Wednesday , the regional court of Klagenfurt decided on Wednesday two officials of the Austrian volleyball @-@ vice @-@ champion A@@ I / DO@@ B because of im@@ balance and detention .
the accused are not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse of counter@@ parties .
in May , he was acquitted of all charges .
the current trial was post@@ pon@@ ed .
according to the prosec@@ utor , Robert Ri@@ ffel had emerged in the preliminary investigation , that the def@@ endants were used in the years 2006 to 2011 , when they were disp@@ oss@@ essed in their capabilities and used for private purposes .
the costs were secured with approximately 400,000 euros .
the sports equipment are also charged because of financial statements .
this fact was the Chairman of the Church Council , Justice , Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it should be negoti@@ ated at a later date .
the defence case , however , laid out that the association was not a statement at any time in any time .
the sports was only bil@@ led for decoration and the sports club , which they had worked from 1982 to 2011 , and invested some 600,000 Sch@@ ill@@ ings in 2001 , around 600,000 Sch@@ ill@@ ings ( about 44@@ ,000 Euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , we stood before the situation : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we lead the club more or lock ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we told one of the def@@ endants , in the bread &apos;s professional aud@@ itors of the financial statements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
before , with his colleagues and co @-@ def@@ endants he decided to take this task .
all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we advanced money to bring our life insurance policies as security at the Bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said during the withdrawal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the association it has been agreed : you can manage the money free , there may be no debts .
on the basis of the financial financial statements , the payment of allowance of allowance has been determined retro@@ sp@@ ectively to 1991 .
therefore one part of the allowance charges only years later , namely from the year 2003 , when an Plus had been on the account , pay@@ ed .
Pau@@ wel@@ ve , therefore , l@@ ump and not detail @-@ details , the former Ob@@ mann also explained the operations .
the accounts and par@@ ch@@ books managed by both the accused , said the Second accused .
why the dis@@ course of the association were not explained in detail , asked the judge .
the association was not interested in detail for financial assistance , it is important to have been only debt trap , so the answer .
in 2011 , when an Invest@@ igation Agency began for Invest@@ igation Agency began , a amount of € 120,000 was transferred to the Executive Board .
these had been back , they declared the accused .
this securities account ran to the name of the second accused , and was not known according to its testimony according to the association .
&quot; why ? , &quot; I wanted to know the judge .
this asked for a long time .
then he thought that he believed that this was the best for the club .
if something happened to him , nobody would have known something of this money , the prosec@@ utor presented in the room .
the co @-@ def@@ endant was informed that justi@@ fies the function .
this bank was formulated as &quot; damage rest@@ itu@@ tion . &quot;
why compensation plans ? , wanted to know judge and prosec@@ utor .
it was the first def@@ endant , he did not agree with this formulation , because the association never had ever suffered a damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do when the lawyer says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are all of the tail@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; am I a representative ? , &quot; he asked .
in addition , the operator , he never paid a cent content , he calcul@@ ates only o@@ dom@@ eter and di@@ ets .
at di@@ ets , he added a bill of € 1,000 per month to the club , but the actual cost would have been much higher , he added .
additional documents for the early years could not refer the def@@ endants .
these terms , after an operating exam , had been judged as correctly , no longer had been kept , they declared .

time of the decision on interest rates for the US banknote
the world is ob@@ serving if the US @-@ grade service in two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , come together to meet the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade the interest shall be raised or not .
a survey of 80 econom@@ ists who were asked by Reuters , found that a little more than half , the last week of view was that the F@@ ed would do so now , now that the F@@ ed will continue to wait for longer and the interest rates at the current stand will be from 0 - 0.25 per cent .
it is a historic event because it has been seven years ago since the F@@ ed Inter@@ est has been on NU@@ LL .
for the first time we approach a situation where a large Central Bank will leave the zero area and starts a process of norm@@ alization of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bide , Head of Staff at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the US economy is based on a relatively high performance , trillion dollars will be added to the balance and generate only low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less steep view of global conditions .
she war@@ ned the markets to stop an increase , but the signs indicate that chances are good against such a step .

revival support at the Delta State University left behind acc@@ us@@ ation
after the slaughter and killing of his gir@@ l@@ friend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he killed his colleagues in the day - Sh@@ annon Lamb wrote a note in order to tell him &quot; sorry , &quot; in the first murder and wanted , &quot; he could make it un@@ done , &quot; published authorities on Tuesday .
the Police in G@@ auti@@ er , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , lecturer for Ge@@ ography and Social Sciences at the Delta State University , calling the emergency number against 10 : 00 on Monday morning
and said he had gone down and killed someone .
he said to the staff of the emergency , that police officers must send police officers to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I poured out my wife yesterday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the house , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one gets anno@@ yed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but probably exc@@ uses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the call@@ ers after his name , but he didn &apos;t give him .
Lamb has no explanation for his shots .
as the police have entered the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ un@@ iss , 41 , and a handwritten note from Lamb , 45 , said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry for me that I might be doing it .
I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman ever loved me . &quot;
after writing the note I made 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a Professor of History and finally killed his own life on Monday evening when police officers assassin@@ ated him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the President William La@@ For@@ ge said that he knows nothing from a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something to Mr Lam@@ son imagination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite reports on Monday that I supp@@ os@@ edly believed that Pr@@ ab@@ iss also had a relationship with Schmidt , said &quot; no information , no evidence for a &quot; tri@@ angular contact . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ un@@ iss has been given by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en who told her about seven years as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good man &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two had di@@ vor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ un@@ iss had a daughter who is 19 and she was &quot; destroyed in the ground . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ un@@ certainly had her daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
Pr@@ ab@@ iss already worked at home , according to the statement of Lin@@ s@@ day Know@@ les , that was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend from Pr@@ un@@ iss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ un@@ iss , who had a dog named Light@@ ning , met him for about three years now .
&quot; she always wanted to help others , &quot; said Know@@ les
the police said that he had called on a certain date on Monday to tell them &quot; he doesn &apos;t go to prison . &quot;
when polic@@ emen visited him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville , he drove his car to the side , fled on foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
he received a doctorate in spring 2015 from Delta State University , a PhD in the university &apos;s website .

row@@ ings : Lufthansa builds the group around
the Lufthansa is planning a major restructuring .
each year , the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros in the year alone with a better organisation .
150 of the world &apos;s 150 exec@@ u@@ tives worldwide will cost the development of the work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the pilot study , the new negotiations are available . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Lufthansa builds its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates the cheaper Eu@@ ros@@ ings .
the real@@ ignment is a profit contribution of around 500 million euros a year from cost and revenue performance , divided the airline on Wednesday .
among other things , the Lufthansa Cargo is no longer a board for passenger transportation .
the cheap airline eu@@ ros@@ ings should be developed as strange as possible .
in the Executive Board about Carsten Sp@@ oh@@ r , he will now be responsible for Eu@@ ros@@ es in the future .
with the new order , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ scores the importance of Eu@@ ros@@ ings to join Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future .
so far , the organisation of the 120 000 associates was complex .
the airline operates under the airline &apos;s roof , three quarters of the annual sales volume of EUR 30 billion .

the conflict between Union and airline led to several strikes in the past few months .

Luke Sha@@ w by Manchester United can &apos;t play for months with double fre@@ igh@@ s
Luke Sha@@ w due to the Champions League &apos;s defeat in Manchester at the PS@@ V Eindhoven a double impact of his right b@@ one .
while this left the left hand holder to the wine and closing it for at least six months of playing , Louis van G@@ aal made the hope to play that Sha@@ w can play back in this season .
the injury was caused by a der@@ less Attack of H@@ é@@ ctor Mor@@ eno within the 15th minute , after the 20 year old Sha@@ w was broken into the PS@@ V region .
he was treated for nine minutes on the field and had the oxygen before being brought to the hospital .
van G@@ aal said : &quot; he has a double leg , and is situated in the hospital . &quot;
tomorrow or maybe he will move a day later and then in Manchester had operated .
it &apos;s aw@@ ful - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United which has very heavily and then plays fantastic , and then that happens .
in the dressing unit he had a oxygen mask .
he wept .
I am no physician , but if you have a double pack , then it will take six months , and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope that he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed to be happy , a red map and the hanging of a capacitor .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbit@@ rator , has not pen@@ alised the Mexican .
van G@@ aal suspected that the Italian refer@@ ee had been ge@@ ared .
you can disc@@ ern itself , if I say that an El@@ f@@ m and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
a bapt@@ isms at Sha@@ ws Account : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words cannot be written how broken I am , my way to recovery begins now , I &apos;ll come back again . &quot;
referring to : Manchester United er@@ ally the loss of Luke Sha@@ w at the defeat at PS@@ V
the British def@@ enders of England , with the European Championship in France , has an additional incenti@@ ve to recover from June to the coming June .
Philli@@ p Coc@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ trainer , said : &quot; it is a very serious injury . &quot;
when a player leaves that way of injury , all is very sad about that .
it is never the intention of our players to viol@@ ate a opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg , as Mexico against Van Ga@@ as the Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very heavy because it was not his intention to viol@@ ate his opponent , and when you hear that it is a very bad injury , that is not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Coc@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me , it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball that was in another direction , so it looked like he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard to be .
I feel very bad . I &apos;m so tired .
the PS@@ V @-@ player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to the hospital - after a ped@@ agog@@ y by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron The Lor@@ ax better ?
it is a matter that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book it will not take long until you know it almost quite co@@ stly .
unless , you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a supplier of child care systems , his favorite children &apos;s book was asked to call himself the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , who released 1971 on the environment of Dr. Se@@ uss in 1971 .
it was a difficult election , writes Cameron in a message to the site of the company Super@@ camps , and continues : &quot; fun , moving , creative , and with a powerful message , it is a book that I would like to give my children , because it seems to have missed an image or a message that we have missed out so far . &quot;
everything nice and good , except that the proce@@ eding section , in which Cameron report@@ edly describes the action of the book , instead gives a summar@@ izing the movie version of 2012 , which added to the new characters and details to enhance the fairly short original text .
&quot; in the middle of the w@@ alled town of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature is gone and even the air a commod@@ ity , hopes it to see their desire to see a real tree , he reads , his right name was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was Theodor Se@@ uss @-@ Geis@@ el , and who died in 1991 , but completely unknown .
as though this could not be susp@@ ect : the text of the Lor@@ ax @-@ film , which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database , which begins to be on the website of Internet Movie Database , where everything is artificial and even the air a commod@@ ity is , hopes a boy called Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y to win the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he decides to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems un@@ likely that Cameron stands the action of the book as little . here is an un@@ checked boy , like the local environment through the cov@@ et@@ ous trees , a ho@@ ck@@ ering , car@@ c@@ ous nature , &quot; that speaks in the name of the trees , &quot; devast@@ ated .
most probably , such a relatively low PR task was carried out to a hel@@ per that the Lor@@ ax has not read 20 times in a row .
a Dow@@ ning Street spokes@@ person said that the text had probably come from Camer@@ oon &apos;s Choice Office .
Super@@ camps confirmed that the text had been delivered by Camer@@ oon , but there were no further direct comments .
Adam LY@@ th was clearly threatened with the expul@@ sion from the German team , but it is still hard
in Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , it is a difficult task , but when you chose the header for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series does not appear on my card .
I would not close a back@@ ward victory .
Al@@ ast@@ air C@@ ooks page may be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in the Batt@@ ing list , and the community is strong ; they do not wear sc@@ ars of 2012 , only a you@@ thful positive attitude .
with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali develops on spin Bow@@ ler and A@@ DI@@ L Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size on test level , is an option for the attack .
this message is based on : Adam Ly@@ th from the UK @-@ Test @-@ K@@ ader , and it is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
to allow Adam LY@@ th to allow me to analyse in Yor@@ k@@ shire for his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , of course .
during its seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cre@@ denti@@ als are al@@ igned to results .
there was no question to Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , as - and I said this to their own sel@@ ections .
long ago , the barrel of Ly@@ th has been extended , but he had the control over his own fate .
if he hop@@ efully further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , a further chance comes .
the England @-@ trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss already praised his attitude , even if he did not so good achievements , and surprised me not ; he is especially a team @-@ man .
the question of how much time is a test stro@@ man receives to set his character is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton received nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and downhill .
the only throwing away that it can be lifted was that England was first put in the Caribbean at first - when Ly@@ th was in peak shape - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he is a pi@@ er man , whom I reck@@ on up .
it is an X @-@ Factor @-@ Cri@@ ck@@ et@@ arium that we saw in Yor@@ k@@ shire in this season , when he posted 236 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , what met us very much .
he must have at least the same chances as those before him , but this depends on the team &apos;s team results in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to beat Mo@@ een next to Cook , see what would get an extra spin Bow@@ ler and get four qu@@ eries , appeared , and I have nothing against it .
I do not see why a b@@ ats@@ man cannot beat there , and this left @-@ handed is already shown that he is a Teu@@ fel@@ sk@@ er@@ l of Cri@@ cket @-@ Player .
Mo@@ een perhaps did not have his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he &apos;s number 3 for them , and there is no major difference .
my former team @-@ mate Just@@ in Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before being joined as an op@@ ter in 2001 .
he had made three hundred p@@ enn@@ ess , and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes in the box as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my own deal with him he impressed me very much as a young man .
people may see your statistics on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a p@@ unt , but there is no large number of backup sp@@ inn@@ s that collect their hands and the trainer have chosen for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team in England , England has made some smart additions to the trainer .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ a on the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , acting as a consultant for the test games could be a master &apos;s coup .
he is one of the most nic@@ est not@@ ches of the game , which is an abundance of experiences , since he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood is designed for the white sphere of the tour and brings energy and powerful use in the setup .
I always felt that he was created for the international Cri@@ cket competition as a player or a coach , and like Mah@@ ela , he shows in@@ sights , of whom we can profit .
sometimes , new voices can also be fresh in the dressing room , even if the messages are in harmony with the first .
collaboration Le@@ y team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , won &apos;t be used in the One @-@ Day@@ ton , R@@ oot was a similar break to Australia and I have no problem with that .
some are not agree , but Co@@ aches and Team@@ building are not able to set the schedule .
and you must remember that , as in the players will depend on their jobs from the results .
such decisions are not made in their heart .
the Bre@@ x@@ it camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = out@@ going Great Britain out of the EU ) could draw at Zul@@ u , if the economy has been fin@@ ed in a raft of economy by 2017
David Camer@@ oon un@@ released new negoti@@ ation strategy to hold great Britain in the EU , with every day deep into difficulties is not &quot; It &apos;s Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , who was bad@@ ly damaged due to Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at , said that some member states , so deep de@@ cks in different cris@@ es such as the EU now is now and not always created from their own fault , Great Britain even created the agenda with the pal@@ pit@@ ations of conc@@ essions and inter@@ rupt changes , which they are usually not satisfied .
in Brigh@@ ton , TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it also doesn &apos;t like it , if they end@@ anger the social protection .
we could also call Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance Minister , climb to summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capit@@ als , make a photograph from a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say that they win allies for re@@ forms .
it &apos;s always about me .
my European boy@@ friend , who wishes everyone to the outside of the EU @-@ tent - &quot; Let us not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and can realize that more and more short @-@ sight@@ ted ministers and civil servants have come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we remain or going .
Germany &apos;s c@@ auti@@ ous ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or Angela Merkel is one ally of allies , but it has been in power for 10 years before it looks bad@@ ly for them , as it happened during ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated ex@@ trav@@ ellers like Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
France &apos;s François Hollande can look back on its re @-@ election or his replacement in 2017 .
he is also a stup@@ id force .
Poland may possibly have a national@@ ist right government , Spain but left Poland soon .
it &apos;s tough to imagine that they will be a bun@@ ch to catch the Sel@@ f@@ ie British , whose energy should be better to avoid the UK leaving the UK - something , which they do not want to separ@@ at@@ ist the most similar separ@@ at@@ ist tenden@@ cies .
therefore , some such as do not plan to help useful remarks , all in the SN@@ P style while Britain &apos;s contribut@@ ors to accelerate the Bre@@ x@@ it process in 2017 , is thought to be my boy@@ friend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new negoti@@ ation was a Ple@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Britain has not gained nothing worth of action . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Europeans know how to burn the Fle@@ et Street to its own expense and what EU sk@@ ep@@ tics are the Oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press bar@@ ons as they were not inspired by Tony had inspired him to support our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
you can indeed remember Boris Johnson , the ore @-@ Euro @-@ opportun@@ ist , who made a name as a &quot; EU @-@ Tr@@ ade Ban@@ ana &quot; Brussels @-@ Cor@@ respon@@ dent in the early 90 &quot; s .
at all its resi@@ due , Ed Mil@@ i@@ tape knew who had his enemies .
it also belonged to the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ car@@ ving , telephone @-@ h@@ ack@@ ing foreigners , and the pseud@@ o non @-@ developing countries that possess most of our large newspapers .
actually , Tony Bl@@ air was similar to them , but he pointed out that if you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , one gets better ban@@ anas in order to di@@ stract him instead of having lunch and dinner .
indeed , Mil@@ i@@ band was more Bl@@ ai@@ ri@@ ans as Bl@@ air himself , when he turned to Camer@@ oon &apos;s contribut@@ ors , because Bl@@ air had turned the principle over the non @-@ approved Constitution of the EU , which then turned down by French and Dutch elec@@ tors in 2005 to open a rear door .
the press has never been able to draw him .
but the nice Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly pl@@ ush on Monday in Westminster . I told him that he had no time to be conf@@ used for me - seems to repeat my time for me , Neil Kin@@ no@@ cks &apos;s boy@@ cott of the eigh@@ teen years , a mistake at that time and today .
it may take time but it must develop a coh@@ er@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but surely with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ sofa has left on Sunday .
Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s &apos;s official position to Europe - I &apos;m doing very friendly - in development .
it says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps traditional Bl@@ auf@@ b@@ ye upwards and the wil@@ low fil@@ let of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ England can certainly be said to say Yes .
it &apos;s what Hil@@ ary &quot; Ein Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and TV this week , when the boy sc@@ outs fought in him , didn &apos;t ad@@ mit that Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s prov@@ oked the prov@@ oked John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell as a shadow of cler@@ ics .
it remin@@ ded me about 70 years of age , when his old father worked on television as a counter@@ part , il@@ lo@@ yal to his Labour Cab@@ inet sh@@ ui , without going far too far away and to lose his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys Battle was even more attractive .
but to fight to stay &quot; under any circumstances - Benn@@ y expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , still what J@@ C told his co @-@ war crimes and M@@ EP@@ s after all reports on Monday night .
what also wants to mediate the under@@ gone Bott@@ om @-@ Up Image by Cor@@ bit@@ n - think that he even has touched me - News discipl@@ ines remains important in the age of TV around the clock and especially in the stru@@ del of Social Media , a breeding place of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
it &apos;s right to give Cameron no fre@@ eway to Europe that allows him to hold resources support in the refer@@ end@@ ums for a self @-@ intelli@@ gi@@ bility how Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said it .
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins keeps for sure .
but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s fundamental added activities to the EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite transformation economy , their anti @-@ capitalist debate - is no longer a question of the mysterious discussion under left dis@@ sidents , for which the Nar@@ c@@ is@@ sm@@ us of the small under@@ stand@@ ings is a central principle of dog@@ matic disp@@ utes .
as with its majority to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son , he is convinced that J@@ C does not lead a campaign to the leaving - foreign diplom@@ ats will be committed to find their sense in all things for their su@@ peri@@ ors .
why should Paris or Berlin apply political capital - they also have disp@@ uted elec@@ torate - to make conc@@ essions to the British when this can be point@@ less ?
the United States already are rather disappointed with the weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government in power because during the launch on Monday of slightly remin@@ is@@ cent of what was British influenza Security Forum .
experts crit@@ ici@@ ze Report of Public Health England about E @-@ cigarettes
alleg@@ ations of a state @-@ financed agency that E @-@ cigarettes is less dam@@ aging than smoking from a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to tobacco products , said researchers .
experts who write to the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , Lanc@@ et joined by the British Health England ( P@@ he ) in her report on e @-@ cigarettes a copy of cigarettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ he released the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basic report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but some researchers have set the load capacity of the data and refers to the connections between a few experts and the tobacco industry .
an article in the Lanc@@ et medical journal last month added the &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ arily forced foundation , &quot; on the P@@ he established his most important conclusion .
two additional researchers have written BM@@ J , and asked whether the alleg@@ ations made &quot; on stone or sand . &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor for European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene , and Tropical Medicine , and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor for Clinical epi@@ dem@@ ics at University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should make efficacy on efficacy . &quot;
they said that the public statement is expected that the current account of P@@ he that &quot; the current best estimate is that E @-@ cigarettes about 95 % less dam@@ aging than smoking &quot; on a detailed review of variation and modeling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 persons who have been called to develop a model for a multi@@ crit@@ erion decision @-@ decision @-@ analysis ( multi @-@ Crit@@ eria Decision @-@ MC@@ DA ) to conduct their opinions on the damage of different nic@@ ot@@ in @-@ hal@@ ved products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summarized in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was named Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director was previously received by British American Tob@@ acco funds ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also wrote references of BA@@ T for public health in a sustainability report , said they .
one of the 12 participants said to the meeting , funds provided by an e @-@ cigarettes manufacturer , but do not support the financing , which he added to reports before the tobacco company Philip Morris International in addition to reports .
the reasons for the selection of the bodies are not supplied , but includes several well @-@ known E @-@ cigarettes Champions , some of which also indicate a sector financing in paper .
some other participants in this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco monitoring .
the tobacco company of P@@ he took part in the meeting .
research collaboration of the Group is called &quot; stri@@ ving &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damages of most products at most criteria &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well wrote .
however , no such connections or restrictions are discussed in the P@@ he report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that the alleg@@ ations of P@@ he states that &quot; so far no evidence exists that E @-@ cigarettes should serve as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers . &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , director of health and well @-@ being at P@@ he said that BM@@ J claims had been responded to this statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E @-@ cigarettes are much less dam@@ aging than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ kers die in his search .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigarettes in comparison are small , but we continue to study long @-@ term effects .
P@@ he has unique bills to information the public about what evidence is proof and what is not , especially when there is much public confusion about relative risks in comparison to tobacco .
almost 80.000 people die of a disease with respect to smoking , and smoking costs a national health system of two billion £ per year .
through the clear occurr@@ ence of current evidence that E @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fra@@ ction of the loss which is caused by the smoking , we fulfil our national jurisdiction .
BBC should launch East@@ poin@@ ter , &quot; former head of Channel 4
the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should stop programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give her right arm &quot; for hit shows as the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the radio fee would only be used to make the type of programs which are not broadcast through other UK stations .
he critic@@ ised the BBC as making it public @-@ legal programs that are likely to be seen from a smaller audi@@ ences to place the most popular shows of the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and television as BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC @-@ General Director , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , he said that he tried to come back for six years at Channel 4 with the BBC to come in contact with the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC are in order , or sends them clearly of un@@ conventional ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said to the Ober@@ haus &quot; Communications &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of his investigation into the future of the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you would like to keep the radio fee , what I mean - or long @-@ term do not hold a good idea , you should at least make its production at least on programs , who do not make any job or put in order .
you &apos;ll send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to achieve a possible broad support for their future .
the idea that nobody would show this is a joke , it is ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous , of course , it is non@@ sense .
Johnson said : &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax team is financed , which could also be financed without subsidi@@ zation .
the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own @-@ productions .
hon@@ est@@ ly , other channels would give their right arm .
I try to see how this is to be public television .
I don &apos;t think that would reduce the BBC at all .
Johnson , a entrepren@@ eur for series , led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC school on the hunt was &quot; because of the amb@@ itions of people who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the most popular broadcast broad@@ casts of the BBC will be back , which was the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that would sell BBC shows like East@@ er@@ ders .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal N@@ ative programs &quot; to BB@@ C4 should not measure , but they can do their tasks , and they may argu@@ ed if they have created all those ob@@ sc@@ ure programs , &quot; Well , of course , we &apos;ve seen all these ob@@ sc@@ ars programs that nobody has seen . &quot;
they put them in a window , where nobody wanted to see them .
for the broadcasting service he said to the committee : &quot; I challenge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value from here .
of course you think all think we received a great value for 150 £ per year , but for people who is for the 150 £ a lot of money , ask me whether this is right , because they consume not much of the BBC .
the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also said before the Committee on Tuesday asked that the BBC can check their ri@@ f@@ ian mission to make , and to maintain . &quot;
he said , only a little bit of the BBC production would now be classified as education . he said that it should be 1 % of its TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and it should take this change in public broadcasting television stations in Australia and Canada , for example , to clari@@ fy and enter@@ tain . &quot;
on the question of the partner@@ ships , El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas such as the Pro@@ ms , of whom he said that only a hand@@ ful in television are shown , and with the commercial must@@ ering alli@@ ances in order to make everything online available .
&apos;@@ Son@@ ogen@@ et@@ ics &apos; can control brain cell through sound waves
the video shows how the N@@ emat@@ odes change the direction in which they radi@@ ated with sound im@@ pulses .
scientists have bred wor@@ ms with genet@@ ically modified ner@@ ve systems that can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny n@@ emat@@ odes change the direction at the moment in which it is exposed to high frequencies which are ir@@ radi@@ ated for the human ear to high frequencies .

further to this topic : researchers read and write the brain activity with light
the researchers said , the wor@@ ms showed the power of a new process , called Son@@ ogen@@ et@@ ics where ultr@@ asound can be used to activate a number of bra@@ ins , heart and muscle cells outside of the body .
Srebrenica en@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said the Guardian that the procedure of a day could replace low brain stim@@ ulation , an inv@@ as@@ ive process that gives electricity im@@ pulses to the brain of people for treating Park@@ inson &apos;s disease .
scar@@ ce react not to ultr@@ asound , but chal@@ as@@ ani pointed out that they did it , when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic bub@@ bles .
the bub@@ bles , found out , intensi@@ fy the ultrasonic of the he@@ aters who then penet@@ rating the wor@@ ms .
the ampli@@ fies ultr@@ asound heads on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 channels and can be found in the membran@@ es of some of the dice .
the sound waves impact the opening of these channel channels and enable the cells in which they are allocated so a report Nature Communications .
in order to create ultr@@ asound controlled n@@ emat@@ odes , Hal@@ as@@ ani genet@@ ically modified wor@@ ms so that some of their three @-@ one will contribute to TR@@ P @-@ 4 channels .
when ultr@@ asound is applied to the changed cre@@ ws , the sound waves prop@@ ag@@ ulated by the micro@@ sc@@ ars and turn into the wor@@ ms where they switch the changed Mot@@ one zones .
the procedure has some simil@@ ar@@ ities with op@@ to@@ genet@@ ics , a ground@@ breaking tool , enabling scientists to lead neur@@ ons with im@@ pulses of light .
but Hal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ ogen@@ et@@ ics could have some advantages compared to this technique .
in contrast to light , which has to be sent to the desired place in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultr@@ asound t@@ issues can happen un@@ hin@@ dered and can be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; we believe that having been possible with com@@ at@@ ry and a therapeutic drug it is possible to temporarily act on ultr@@ asound signal for certain neurolog@@ ical treatments , &quot; said Hal@@ as@@ ani .
other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and ins@@ ulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

eight golden rules for life in residence halls
11 years ago I moved as a self @-@ dis@@ sen@@ sible 19 @-@ year @-@ old student in a student residence , still in the belief in Ber@@ ets and moral re@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the donated smile of which I have donated - and to the numerous , lang@@ ug@@ ely complaints about others .
most of which I have lear@@ nt , can dist@@ illed in eight simple rules .
the entry into student residence halls reaches from slightly nerv@@ es up to an absolutely fri@@ gh@@ tening .
it is temp@@ ting to fle@@ ece : people tell whether you are going to see if and where you have taken the Sabbath year , where you think in regards to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you do not really love Mar@@ m@@ ite , because in Ernst , guys , it is just a yeast extract h@@ ah@@ aha that I am in my room . &quot;
bre@@ athe through .
and help others to do the same - pose a question and show interest .
it direc@@ ts the conversation and helps you to find people what you like to speak contrary to those with whom you would not say , even if your lashes are burned in fire and this fire extingu@@ isher were .
let people leave humans .
the rooms of people often transform into drinks @-@ recipes , film / night events and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people will attract and under@@ wear their under@@ wear .
referring to : do not remember to start with a relationship with a relationship
introduction obtained a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student halls provide a room @-@ to @-@ room @-@ B@@ um@@ mel culture that can be friendly and soci@@ ally and to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for anyone who tries to recover .
nothing in the culture possible to tell you : &quot; I like you , and I want to continue our friendship , but you must go away to keep the energy back , which I have consumed for the interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a com@@ it@@ ones should be exhau@@ sted - and send it a SMS instead .
A@@ pro@@ po@@ s anchor : do it .
a guy in my student residence had the idea that a not sealed door was an invitation .
he looked some things .
close together through baking .
since you begin the University at the cli@@ max of Back @-@ Man@@ ie , the clo@@ ds on the doors of mankind will begin with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es , less stran@@ gely as the welcome of the 1950 @-@ ies &quot; Welcome in the neighbourhood , I have somewhat b@@ aked you . so , and now I smile when I give you a few personal questions . &quot;
the home @-@ made le@@ aks along is a good way to close friends .
their roomm@@ ates are committed to enter@@ tain and become associated with a marv@@ ell@@ ous surprise at the end of the end .
of course , this depends on whether you are an even permanent b@@ aker .
po@@ ison@@ ous little st@@ ump from flour , sugar and fat , make people sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ying to sleep when you anchor .
to steal , common crimes in residence halls .
of course the usage of chick@@ ens is a theft , but is it possible to take a drop of milk for your tea ?
check it with the Mil@@ ky Way .
chances are well to say they themselves to use even when they cook inside the inside .
if someone claims to ste@@ er your things , it is anno@@ ying , and you have to kill my compassion , but try to kill me as my roomm@@ ates who added to their milk a r@@ ins@@ ing agent provo@@ king th@@ iev@@ es .
she is now in prison .
you should make no noise , the people from sleep or from work .
it &apos;s not just about how to be an everyday human being , but that you belong in the tru@@ est sense of the belief that are sitting in the glass .
a girl in my hall@@ way asked its neigh@@ bors , whether they are something like doing something , drum and bass more qui@@ eter , because it got three o &apos;clock in the morning , and it had a test in the morning .
she re@@ acted with still listen to music .
when they finally got up at 5 a.m. , she left her neighbours and went to sleep for two hours before she had shut up her own music , shut up her door and turned to her three @-@ hour test .
would it be a romantic yet if your future sp@@ ouse would move into the same student dormitory in random ?
in the other way , it would not be a fundamental right when you hold a fellow female for your future sp@@ ouses to do themselves and then join them every day and perhaps they may experience every day and perhaps how they bring together all common friends ?
of course the heart does not go his own way - but when a hot co @-@ occup@@ ant will definitely not be your future sp@@ ouse in , try to in@@ try out of a few dist@@ ill@@ ation .
in the exciting moment you notice that someone has put his keys in his non @-@ closed rooms , the border between a Ul@@ k and Mo@@ b@@ bing is running when it seems .
a good route is funny , but it only takes ey@@ es@@ g@@ eries until it becomes B@@ um@@ er@@ ang .
divide by plug@@ ging a valuable and am@@ using lesson on security - but never do any one &apos;s room with t@@ ooth@@ paste and sh@@ ampoo .
connect your door , and place your keys in a glass of water , which you will then place in the freezer - but drives your owners at the ceiling no more than twice .
terra@@ ced houses for refugees , all flying , Ger@@ bound @-@ thick@@ ener
the real estate business Markus Gil@@ dner reli@@ es on the Central @-@ Fran@@ cop@@ ic H@@ ousing Complex for People who don &apos;t have a lot of money .
so for refugees - but also as signal : &quot; not only refugees need a living room , but also the mother @-@ educ@@ ated mother and the Ger@@ ing@@ er@@ ener . &quot;
&quot; I show how one can still build and build well today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview
thousands of refugees are dr@@ au@@ ght in the housing market .
the entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner believes , to know how rapidly cheaper living space can be created : it builds a project terra@@ ced houses for refugees .
Mr. Gil@@ r@@ ens , a lot of refugees dr@@ au@@ ght in the stock market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : a mass housing in containers or turn@@ around has no sustainability .
for people remain in a large part here .
in view of the refugee @-@ plan@@ ing , we also need enough space for the next decades .
a very ban@@ al , three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution .
Gil@@ berto : a town house needs most of the least space .
it facilit@@ ates integration .
that is different if you bring people living in flats .
each of the six buildings built in the pilot project consists of three residential units for each of four asylum seek@@ ers .
each residential unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a dining room .
it may be that many refugees say it is peace , I go back .
then the houses can be converted easily according to the needs of the needs .
how high are the costs ?
mer@@ cen@@ aries : the price of 160 square metres of living space per house amounts to 184 000 Euro , without land .
this is man@@ age@@ able .
the construction lasted six months .
this is appropriate .
have the construction rules stra@@ ight@@ forward ?
Gu@@ tors : I have bought my project correctly .
especially complicated , it always makes the threatened o@@ cl@@ etian &apos;s special construction and the slot regulation .
gr@@ ass@@ y .
it is still under@@ stand@@ able , who creates three apartments in a tow@@ n@@ house , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities the place is still missing .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
Gu@@ tors : there was those who were accused to build luxury building for asylum seek@@ ers .
what definitely not is wrong .
but are you not spar@@ ked the compet@@ itor for affordable apartments ?
Gil@@ dies : true : in the last five years we had a building boom in Germany , but it was built for luxury apartments that can hardly be aff@@ ord .
my project has the message , also the normal people need living room .
not only refugees , but also the mother @-@ over @-@ alone mother or the Ger@@ ing@@ er@@ ener alone .
I show how you can still build and build well today .
so it goes .

it is worth to ensure that your mobile phone is charged while updating is charged or is located close to a loading machine , so the battery is charged .

men tested on 17 @-@ year old Afghan women
the police search for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , around 23.@@ 45 o &apos;clock , three young men were walking from Bad So@@ den in the direction of Sal@@ ary .
one from the group , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old communist , followed by police his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at this point the Group was located at the height of the b@@ ft gas station .
there were also three persons on the premises of the gas station .
one of these men now cried out to the young people , and beat on his f@@ ist with his f@@ ist on his face .
the sacrifice was cut off at a nose and ch@@ ased out of the nose .
when his two friends were ha@@ sted and du@@ st@@ oned on the bats , he initially set off his victims .
of his friends , the last young man was brought home now .
the perpet@@ rator followed the group with a passenger car up to their flat and drove over several times .
when the car saw no more , the last one went to smoke a cigarette .
there he was again attacked from the ra@@ cket and another male person .
a striking increase in the sacrifice was laid on the face and the upper th@@ igh@@ s of the victim .
the last had to be brought in a hospital for the purpose of medical care .
only a v@@ ague daily is available .
one of the men had about 1,80 meters in size .

Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice and invests 3@@ 10000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ i@@ ausen .
also , also Zambia is also pleased by Bernd Bor@@ mann , economic transport in U@@ ta S@@ eim @-@ Schwartz and As@@ endor@@ fs Mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert .
in many places on the country , doctors - As@@ endorf missing luck : Dr. Frank Müller continues its practice in practice on 1 October .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ resi@@ des goes to retirement , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is going to take part in the next few months again with half a place to the site .
after a reconstruction , Müller opened its practice on 12 October until then he is investing € 3@@ 10000 on the premises at St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us Street 6 .
it was sympath@@ y at the first sight when the wheel house was met earlier than years ago Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll met , who currently completes their specialist education at a hospital and will also enter into practice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the gar@@ bage can fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ low and laugh@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was time , I just called them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea was in acc@@ ord to practice the idea of putting his own practice in As@@ endorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the close contact to the patient is very attractive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we want to know and accompany the families of the years . &quot;
as a speaker , he also see that his own boss will soon be .
and so one was rehear@@ sing , the gar@@ bage bought the house with the practice .
they will continue to live in Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
there the two @-@ times family father Frank Müller also grew up his medical studies in Hannover , followed by doctors in several medical practices and in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently working as a gar@@ dener in Sul@@ ingen , moreover he was appointed Chief physician in Di@@ ep@@ ywood in 2009 and is engaged in a voluntary basis in DRC @-@ will@@ ing@@ ness Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
from 19 September , the practice for the new boss will be prepared .
during the sur@@ geon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ low breaks as a domestic doctor , his wife speci@@ alis@@ es in ur@@ sel ( interest rates ) on neu@@ rolo@@ gi@@ sts .
the gar@@ bage , both addresses , want to let down in practice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the End@@ os@@ copy comes out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the renovation , the rooms will look more modern .
we are offering more ultr@@ asound examination and long @-@ term - and load @-@ like EK@@ GS and need a talk to any more .
the ED@@ V is also completely renewed .
a daily amount of 50,000 euros will get the rub@@ b@@ ish within the district framework ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) as well as from the joint municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; this shows how proud and joy@@ ful we are that the practice is continued to continue , &quot; emphas@@ ises the idea of Zambia Bernd Bor@@ mann .
approximately 2000 patients come to the field of rocky out@@ breaks , according to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll in the North German operating practice , there are about 500 .
in As@@ endorf there is another home practice .
a positive effect of the practice by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains in the Ur@@ sel Fel@@ low in As@@ endorf .
if no successor found , it would also be gone .
those who visit mar@@ gar@@ bage speaking cur@@ few , by the way , looking still in familiar faces : take over the seven medical experts and the cleaning force of the wheel stands .
with their departure in As@@ endorf a era ended after all , the physician practic@@ ed there for 30 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ur@@ sel Fel@@ i@@ breaks were ch@@ u@@ ck@@ led . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a little mid@@ wives read them after the long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we stay further in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and many patients certainly still see , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the intern@@ ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband completes this situation : &quot; we have a 6000 square meter property . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I have pressed on gar@@ dening work , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the couple loved two grand@@ sons and travels .
Croatia : &quot; we let the refugees go through &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the border controls on our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister for Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain parallel in parallel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is clear that everyone who wants to put an asylum request to make this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the supply and safety of the people stand in the fore@@ ground .
but it is clear also that it takes clear signals , &quot; said the Minister .
the people must know that we do not accept cross @-@ borders fluids , nor on the Austr@@ o @-@ Slovenian border .
it takes a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia
before that the Croatian government had previously reported that Slovenia would continue to travel for the coming refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany , and under conditions also cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
for this , the Minister of the Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ head Z@@ ni@@ dar was not seen in sp@@ aw@@ bach .
the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors be &quot; absolutely in@@ acceptable &quot; , Slovenia would rather be the monitoring of the border - especially to Hungary - intensi@@ fy .
by contrast , the German border with Croatia is already strong as an outer bound@@ ary of the Schengen Area .
as the Minister stressed , Slo@@ veni@@ ans wants to restri@@ ct its limits for refugees but not least .
&quot; every EU member must fill his obligations ; otherwise , the system cannot work , &quot; emphas@@ ised Gy@@ ör@@ head Z@@ ni@@ dar .
as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had already attempted to travel to the border crossing of T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ ID in the night of Croatia to soak for registration .
the Croatian police have picked up its total ma@@ ize fields .
according to local media , since then , in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , police cars will constantly meet with new refugees .
it happens predominantly for Syrians and Afghanistan , including numerous women and children .
rescue service life and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days , its country has about 4000 refugees , the Minister of the Interior , Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , buses from Pre@@ se@@ vo would have brought to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border , which has so far led migran@@ t to the Hungarian border , Croatian and Serbian media reported on Wednesday , reported Croatian and Serbian media .
the government in Belgrade , however , denied that it is to hit the people certain routes : &quot; neither can we do it , nor want to do this . &quot;
according to media reports , a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town S@@ ID , in the course of the day , more buses would be expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants were traveling by Serbia around 500 kilometres distant from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border .
&quot; we have heard that Hungary had prepared , so the police told us that we should come here , &quot; said one of the refugees .
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
with this , it could actually be righ@@ ted to have already crossed the communication of the previous Balkan route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a little further west .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia &apos;s interior minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had emphas@@ ised that his country has prepared appropriate plans for the case of strong state capit@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for details , he did not indicate that Croatia had a non @-@ Schengen member &quot; comprehensive possibilities for the border control . &quot;
one may carry out rig@@ orous controls to qualify for membership in the Sch@@ en@@ gen@@ ium .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 . since then , the EU has consistently been rel@@ ying a good record , subject to the standard of border controls .
according to Serbian Parliament , there are still about 300 refugees d@@ ump@@ ed behind the Hungarian border area .
according to the media reports , they had spent the past night at the border crossing of Hor@@ g@@ os , who led to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two limit exceeded the Hor@@ g@@ os and Back@@ i Bre@@ g are still closed .
whether the remaining refugees continue to travel to Croatian border , it is still un@@ clear .
the Serbian minister of the Interior Minister Neb@@ oj@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic was tried to re@@ ass@@ ure on Wednesday early morning in Hor@@ g@@ os : he will hold the debates about Alternative farms of refugees , after the Hungarian border ended , for an early stage .
it would not currently act around very high refugee quot@@ ations .
they could not say if they would continue their journey over Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers collect migrants - hazardous - Alternative items
however , private Hungarian refugee workers already started to distribute the refugees maps , which are characterized by alternative routes through Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not harm@@ less : in parts of the border area there are still 20 years after the end of the conflict there is still not cleared min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police arrested that a team of min@@ ors in the border region was sent .

F@@ ed@@ Ex @-@ income bl@@ ended , financial outlook for 2016 lowered
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the Lie@@ fer @-@ Gig@@ ant slow@@ ed his profit from the weaker demand for cargo services and higher costs in his boat riding service .
the company also said that it plans to hire approx . 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for their holidays .
at this point in the past year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to set 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the stock market fell to more than 2.5 percent in the market in 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. Announ@@ ces a prize of $ 10,@@ 40 and 10,@@ 90 $ in the financial year , which ends in the next May , 20 cents less than in previous forecast .
an@@ alysts predi@@ ct a survey of the Fac@@ t@@ Set 10,@@ 84 $ .
the lower view comes in spite of the price increases , which will take an average of 4.9 percent and will be effective on 4 January , and despite higher education for Bo@@ d@@ escaped from heavy and large packages that will be collected from November .
the company said that it is still expected that the result compared to the previous year &apos;s cost reduction , higher revenues and because of growth in online trade .
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company brings a solid income , especially in production and global trade , especially in manufacturing and global trade .
the plans for the vac@@ ations were announced a day later than that of the ri@@ val@@ en UPS , which plans to hire 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , about the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share amounted to 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just behind the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve from Z@@ acks Investment Research announced an@@ alysts predi@@ ct .
sales rose by 5 percent to 12.2 billion $ .
six out of acks asked an@@ alysts expect $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
in recent years F@@ ed@@ Ex has reported a decline in international priority claim that stag@@ n@@ ating sales in its unit express delivery .
the boom in online shopping has increased its results by F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
during the last quarter , sales in the boat transport increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat sh@@ allow for bigger packages and sel@@ f@@ ters .
the Express unit accounted for higher income due to higher prices , while the result because of higher working costs in the cargo business fell .
in the market retail trade , about one hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares fell by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,15 $ .
at Tuesday it included 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below the record high on 11 June .
at the most unexpected meeting in the year , Federal Reserve Strat@@ ces two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras @-@ Mah@@ ag@@ oni @-@ table sitting down to decide whether it is time for the first time since almost a decade to lift the Leit@@ z .
dro@@ pl@@ ting above them at one end of the t@@ inn@@ ed , two @-@ story seating areas is a mur@@ al in the United States .
the card is a reminder that the F@@ ed @-@ President Jan@@ et L. Y@@ elles and their colleagues said the economic interests of the nation to all other things .
the Central Bank has a two @-@ fold task of Congress : maxim@@ um@@ eration of US employment and prices stable here .
but since the big recession , the F@@ ed leaders have been recognized that there has been an imp@@ ec@@ uli@@ ar third quarter : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be made to the X @-@ factor in a decision to re@@ declare it . it is announced on Thursday , whether the US economy is ready to become acc@@ ust@@ omed from the unprecedented short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most data of the economy show that it grows solid , the youngest Tur@@ bul@@ ences against the global financial markets , which have already been able to increase these volumes by raising the interest rate for state bonds , and it is also just one @-@ quarter percentage point .
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation in first line will be the most important what they observe , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , Chief Economic in the Mak@@ ler@@ ship Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think when they were looking for a pre@@ wall to raise the interest rate , increased un@@ certainty around the global market enough justi@@ fication , continued to wait , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no con@@ sens@@ us about what the F@@ ed is going to do on themselves the finance market .
about half of the econom@@ ists , which were surveyed by Bloom@@ berg , have predicted an interest increase of this week .
however , the financial markets , however , await the F@@ ed , with a key indi@@ an indicator that shows a 30 % chance of increasing .
this indicates a decline in the share capital if the F@@ ed boo@@ sts the proposition , unless the strateg@@ ists assume the blow , it is estimated that a further increase is far away .
on Tuesday the Dow Jones Industrial average rose by 2@@ 28.@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that F@@ ed @-@ policy with@@ drew the set within this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief econom@@ ist at Moody &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would raise the propositions at that point , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if they do it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have to go very far in their declaration to calm the financial markets so they will not be in pan@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argu@@ ed that an interest increase would re@@ ass@@ ure the financial markets because they would eliminate un@@ certainty when the F@@ ed would take to eliminate .
even before a month , the F@@ ed seemed to increase the sentence by 0.25 percentage points for this month , the first little step in a slow deep@@ ening of the mon@@ et@@ ous conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ella had said in the spring and in early summer , that in this year , despite the liber@@ als of liber@@ als , more economic progress would be necessary , increasing the proposition .
although the job creation has slow@@ ed down in August , improvement on the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate fell to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for over seven years , and close to levels to see the F@@ ed as full employment .
wage increases are shown to sign a recovery .
and although inflation was steadily under the goal of 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed representative said that the main reason is the temporary effects of clearly lower oil prices .
the economy &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and needs them due to the tension of the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ d@@ son , Head of the Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ ages .
but financial markets around the world got together at the end of the last month after China had cast its currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial Average value was down in May by more than 16 % , than investors had feared that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would thr@@ ott@@ le global growth .
the market has recovered slightly in this month , the Dow now runs nearly 10 % below the May High in May .
for the F@@ ed Representative , the market tur@@ bul@@ ences influence complex lim@@ ulation when to increase the interest .
&quot; when the events on the financial markets and the news on the weakness of Chinese economy did not appear in the last few weeks , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ lin@@ ers , Senior Research Fel@@ low at the U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the U.S. banknote .
now , he predic@@ ts that they will wait at least one month to get the impact better in the handle .
&quot; there is a lot of un@@ certainty that what impact on the US economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ lin@@ ers .
the health of the world economy is none of the main concerns , therefore it should not be related technically in their decision @-@ making .
but in the end , the F@@ ed monetary authorities has become the world .
the influence of the central bank was enormous throughout the last years .
the mere note of the then Director Ben Bern@@ an@@ ke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could fly their mon@@ et@@ ary expansion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dis@@ solves tur@@ bul@@ ences around the globe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a world where markets and econom@@ ies are increasingly un@@ flo@@ ated , from the F@@ ed Represent@@ atives , it can not only super@@ v@@ ise the developments in other place but also with other central banks and experts will also advise to obtain a better understanding of the global economy .
it is more art as science , &quot; Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of the Global Strategy on Net Management , Inc . , Inc .
Jeffrey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has linked a story of transactions to financial market movements that are not linked with the economic foundation date . &quot;
l@@ acker , voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , dedicated to an interest increase , cited decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce its Leit@@ z@@ ins by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; despite limited effects on growth in the United States , &quot; said L@@ acker .
a year later , the F@@ ed representative closed these cuts again .
the F@@ ed should set aspects of financial stability only during a serious crisis such as the market crash of 2008 , Adam S. Pos@@ en , a former member of the Committee on the Bank of England .
the youngest Tur@@ bul@@ ences do not come near to this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she will certainly not come into the situation where they are afraid of interest in the interest of interest , because the markets emerged , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Pozn@@ an , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double Mand@@ ate and men@@ tions not the financial stability , and until it is changed , I don &apos;t think it should be kept like the time before .

of course , the very special classes is at a right school .
Brazil pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy individuals
the Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric organization SP@@ RS tries to clari@@ fy in a sho@@ cking way of women how important good nutrition is while nurs@@ ing . you do this with the presentation of pictures from babies that are painted in boo@@ sts that are painted with represent@@ ations of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates , that give babies all the nutrients that they need to set up a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research results indicate that a higher cal@@ orie intake did not import the only di@@ lem@@ an adaptation to mothers .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet was pregnant women really aff@@ ecting the genes of their babies and protecting it in the development of tum@@ ours .
unfortunately , a healthy eating of the child may affect the immune system negative .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ k Hall
the church at Bern@@ ried was approved the construction den@@ d@@ um for the 2.3 million euro multi @-@ gym .
and he did an exception .
the roof may be flat for solar system .
planning for the long awa@@ ited turn@@ around building at Bern@@ rie@@ k sports grounds are step by step forward : in the most recent community meeting , the planned construction work was un@@ blessed without large discussions .
before , the board had agreed upon a proposal to respect the exemp@@ tion of the exemp@@ tion &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; from the valid construction plan .
with the &quot; exception &quot; it went around the permission for a special type regarding the roof structure .
it is intended to be erected a &quot; arti@@ c roof with a non @-@ po@@ ck@@ lace first and roof terrace . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; background of planning is the planned use of the roof area for solar plants : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this way we got together a wonderful large south layout , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger said in the meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Liberation War , it also went to turn the movement of energy for energet@@ ic reasons - differently than in the development plan - below 10 degrees .
the volume of the hall is thus considerably reduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the plan of the development plan does not &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No exceptions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whereas the Bern@@ rie@@ k Municipal Council has been rel@@ ying more restri@@ ctive in the rule assignment &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it is no recur@@ ring project at the turn@@ around construction : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; so St@@ eigen@@ berger .
the sports centre at the sports centre is a community project of the village and SV Bern@@ ried .
at costs approx . 2.3 million euros are calculated .
grants are expected from the training and lat@@ itude transport .
in the next process of proce@@ eding , the building ad@@ den@@ d@@ um for the 18 x 36 metre hall will now be submitted to the District Court as well as at the exam .
clinic P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ burg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital is expected to be closed as planned - namely in 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) will be the new Medical Director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au hospital .
the Station as well as the majority of the employees draw near P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ burg by Pin@@ ong@@ au .
this is surprising by surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the district called Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
a decision on this respect , however , is the Supervisory Board , and the t@@ aps will last Wednesday , September 23 .
should the plans be implemented then all of the nearly 50 employees were running at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ burg .
the overwhelming majority should move along with fishermen and the next existing Station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are present .
the employees who are not allowed to work with Sch@@ ong@@ au should be offered to a work@@ station in W@@ eil@@ heim , such as J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
the employees were informed about the plans .
triggered by Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been one of the senior director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic since the beginning of 2004 and is now to a private practice in close proximity of the hospital .
in question that he should succeed , according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ white , the name &quot; Fischer , &quot; came to play in the game , who declared itself to take over the lead and change his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au as of 1 October .
for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this is an &quot; appreci@@ ation &quot; and a distribution of the offer in the &quot; Internal Medicine &quot; section , such as J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ emaker and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) speci@@ alis@@ es in the inner sections on gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
pass over for the next two years , fishermen with his team , if the board of directors are agreed , both houses lead , until then the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ eals chamber , which still has 35 beds in the next year , will definitely be closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ burg after almost 140 years .
the administrative district has been planned for 2018 , when the ongoing renovation at the hospital W@@ eil@@ heim is completed .
J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , which is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board , went out to meet the property , under which the property is in possession of the federal bodies , in the future , the property is to be used as accommodation for asylum .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do I close . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White could not say , there are several consider@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently there are a short @-@ time care of Car@@ itas and a Tag@@ esp@@ sy@@ chiat@@ ry there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity comes not again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fis@@ her@@ man via the Qu@@ i@@ asi @-@ move to the Le@@ ch , which had been recorded by the employees &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very pru@@ d@@ nis@@ ci@@ full . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have not given a real perspective for the house in which fishermen has been working as a general practition@@ er for more than 30 years .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleague to take the post of the medical Director .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ burg ( once 100 beds ) had been liqui@@ dated back for decades in the past decades , and were closed again , for example the surgery and birth assistance .
the bal@@ ances of the Rhein @-@ Neckar lions are required this evening ( 20.@@ 15 pm ) at the Berg@@ ischer HC .

Jag@@ dun@@ gh@@ a with two injured Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor engineers have been seriously injured during their ma@@ ize afternoon during their ma@@ ize afternoon .
during the super@@ st@@ ition on a corn field at Pr@@ at@@ au ( Landkreis Witt@@ enberg ) , several h@@ unters have been in use as the police hur@@ ried .
after a shot of shot , a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injury and were brought in hospitals .
just like it could come to the accident , it was first un@@ clear .
the Criminal Police was determined .
crime 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate victims of violent crimes
a crime susp@@ icious has led the police to glue the 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
in the hur@@ ri@@ r , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old gave the young people to death and to have cast their bodies into a channel in Rock@@ enhausen .
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate from Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate from Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
the young woman of young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enhausen in Kaiserslautern , as the public prosec@@ utor and police reported on Wednesday .
as a tat@@ too susp@@ ect , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old student , who only knew the indication and initiated investig@@ ator to the place of poll@@ s .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported on Sunday morning , having arrived on the eve after a visit to a festival in Rock@@ enhausen , not agreed to come home .
in search of a young woman , the investig@@ ator continued to take on personal bel@@ ong@@ ings of the sacrifice .
finally , there is a crime against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old , among in@@ dem@@ nity , in the circle of friends and friends of the wounded .
the alleged off@@ ender was then led by the police to a channel in Rock@@ enhausen , where the dead was found .
according to the authorities , the authorities det@@ oured to kill the 16 @-@ year @-@ old police and put a dead body into the canal .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be brought to the o@@ at on Wednesday and investig@@ ator brought him a stop .
the decision on the approach to the fact should bring further investigation .
refugees need accomod@@ ations : study war@@ ns against housing
the situation in the German housing market is ke@@ en .
even more refugees seek for an affordable lead .
pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing construction is in front of a challenge .
the distribution of the German residential community has long ago begun .
with the coming refugees and working seek@@ ers from the EU are increasingly on a market that is already over@@ loaded in many big cities .
you compete with a welcome citizens over the last affordable apartments .
in order to cover the demand for affordable apartments , 400,000 new units should be built by 2020 .
regarding this result , a study was performed on behalf of the role of &quot; Social Resi@@ dential Development . &quot;
for comparison , in Germany 26@@ 0,000 units are completed in Germany .
in the case 14@@ 0,000 apartments are missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer required to live asylum seek@@ ers in their original accommodation .
many are aiming at the housing market and lined up into the long hi@@ kes in front of the apartment rentals .
according to the Federal Statist@@ ical Office , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers stayed for rent in the last year .
but the negative development of the residential property is not just to pay for the rising refugees .
the study also makes significant changes in residential policy of the last years .
Germany Sli@@ ding a residential deficit before her , which is greater from year to year greater .
to date , Matthias Günther , the author of the study , has already been missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas .
many professional working lived so in large cities not@@ alled in WG @-@ rooms .
young adults stayed longer in the housing market of voluntarily longer in &quot; Hotel Mama . &quot;
in its large cities the number of square meter per capita has fallen back for the first time in the past years .
in order to solve the problem , the &quot; Social Resi@@ dential Building &quot; suggests a re@@ boot .
new incenti@@ ves to boost social housing development again .
thus , the under@@ mine tax would be ren@@ ounced and the property tax available for subsidi@@ zed housing shall be suspended .
according to the alliance , there will be attractive tax am@@ ort@@ ment options according to the alliance .
the Bank Kf@@ W &apos;s funding programme comes already well in towns and municipalities already well .
a good week after the launch was announced on Monday night with 184 million euros more than half of which had been raised to about 300 million euros .
now the project could be sc@@ aled .
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia
by Hung@@ arians , practically no more , there are more refugees in the way over Croatia .
Zagreb announces , through a trip through Slovenia to north without hur@@ d@@ les .
nevertheless the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia over the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
&quot; I spoke with the Slovenian Minister , and if it is necessary we will organize a corridor , &quot; said the Croatian Minister of Minister at the Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
Slovenia is between Croatia and Austria and belongs to the Schengen area .
the EU country Croatia is not a Schengen country .
according to the position of the Serbian Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees are broken into Croatia to reach Western Europe there .
more than 500 people have come across the T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik border , the Croatian TV broad@@ c@@ aster RTL Germany .
Hungary had sealed its border for refugees on the eve of the day .
new laws , which came into force the same day in the same day , make super@@ flu@@ ous As@@ ylum in Hungary .
Croatia wants to pass the refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Mil@@ ano@@ vic declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can go through , and we prepare for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who live and want to achieve something .
but there were people who wanted to live in Croatia .
on the morning the Croatian police attacked the first refugees on Serbia &apos;s border to Croatia &apos;s accession to the EU neighbourhood .
most of them also reported media reports from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came both by bus and tax@@ is to the Serbian border town of S@@ ID .
immediately after their arrival , they tried to reach the green border to Croatia by foot .
at the Croatian @-@ Serb border , refugees d@@ ump@@ ed at bound@@ ary .
for this , the border on the other d@@ angers : there are still sharp mines in the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s .
mine clearance is supposed to create a secure passage soon .
after Hungary the closure of the border will scar@@ cely more refugees arrive after Hungary .
on Tuesday the police counted 365 days .
shortly before Tor@@ end on Monday it was still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws obtain over@@ coming and damage to the bound@@ ary of the border .
in the southern Hungarian border of Sz@@ eged this 35 sentence was initiated .
the det@@ erg@@ ents above five years and the deportation from the country .
according to the immig@@ ration authority I have received a total of 94 asylum seek@@ ers on Tuesday , of which nearly all - 93 - in the most important transition .
among the applic@@ ants , 13 families with small children as well as two older people .
on Wednesday morning there were still 40 refugees stopped there .
but virtually no one has the prosp@@ ect of being granted for asylum in Hungary .
after Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; secure third country . &quot;
the di@@ min@@ ed asylum seek@@ ers should be sh@@ aken there .
before the &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ one &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , only a few hundred refugees assembled .
people started to bu@@ ck in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
they gathered up the tr@@ ash to leave the tens of thousands of people in the road@@ side over the past few weeks .
the pl@@ ywood was dismant@@ led and rebuilt one of the recording @-@ door in the border town .
the aim of this , nobody wanted to express itself .
Austria will reach only a few refugees after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary .
the country has also ampli@@ fied its border controls .
but in order to mig@@ rate the 20,000 migrants lost in the country .
in Salzburg approximately 1400 people are waiting for the continuation of Germany .
the train service from there to Germany was stopped by the German authorities in the morning .
in over@@ land , smaller groups of refugees came to a regular basis .
mayor continued &quot; Gest@@ ures over the Border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were busy after the bridge on Sunday with the entrance hall , when suddenly ten people were traveling with travel agencies at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ ern@@ st@@ einer mayor Alois Mo@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to train with the train to Pass@@ au .
because Germany was sur@@ pris@@ ingly likely to stop the rail traffic with Austria on Sunday , but the city that immediately offered his assistance and the stran@@ ded together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars crossed over the border into the near Pass@@ au Island .
prior to that , we opened the un@@ hop@@ eful guests only once , with J@@ ause and Be@@ verages .
we said right , we bring them by car to Pass@@ au .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was of course , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N conversation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grat@@ eful .
a man did not take it to pay a generous donation - 100 Euros for the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; this is very pleased , &quot; so Stad@@ ler .
the gest@@ ed train tickets had reached on Sunday evening in Wels from one ICE in a regional direction Pass@@ au , in order to stop after the short notice of the announcement that the railway traffic to Germany was stopped , but still over the border .
but the regional train was stopped at the Inn by W@@ ern@@ stein @-@ Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein , the limit is generally higher in the course .
the bridge festival with the Bavarian neighbours must be soci@@ able on Sunday , week@@ day previously a bridge racing - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án rel@@ ates to us of forty thousand , is a logical result of a seem@@ ingly holy policy :
rather than in the R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke camp immediately at the erection of structures to help human@@ eness , our ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or became un@@ official and publicly covered by the attitude of Hungarian government in the dun@@ geon of the National Soci@@ alism .
suffering from this Policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now faced in the border areas with cha@@ otic states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even the poultry workers have to determine that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yellow land &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which they invited and welcomed , nothing as another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there will be a major challenge in view of the persist@@ ing refugee currents and the near Win@@ ters , to allow us of de@@ cent conditions for protective seek@@ ers .
and there will be one more bigger - peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad in search of 35,000 w@@ inter@@ ed Quar@@ rels
Konrad has filled all his hands with the refugee camp .
Christian Konrad is acc@@ ust@@ omed to have his word weight .
the government deployed the earlier mighty &quot; Rai@@ ff@@ eisen ban@@ ker to set up qu@@ arti@@ c for thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the first acceptance centre of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already gained his grip .
&quot; we have no hom@@ eless more in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported about his first success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees that came to Austria on Monday would be without great host , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and praised the organiz@@ ational &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the Interior Ministry said on a &quot; k@@ ris@@ er situation . &quot;
the total amount of Konrad Quart@@ z rendered a total of 85@@ ,000 in the he@@ avi@@ est year .
in order to meet the numbers , in the next few weeks , 35,000 accommodation should be found , 20.000 are supposed to deliver 15,000 of them .
if there are more refugees , we can do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but no barrel without the floor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the captains of cars he had already led up talks .
they had been promised to him , even for the coming refugees qu@@ arti@@ ve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Upper Austria it goes well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ferry Mai@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ av@@ atar supports Konrad .
tomorrow , there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , it shall be clari@@ fied as the church will help .
great expectations on the As@@ ylum coordinator also sets the ORF action &quot; Hel@@ ps like We . &quot;
on the platform , individuals can offer un@@ complicated accommodations .
in addition , it is hop@@ ing for hotels that stopped in winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ised the standards for accommodation as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in case of emergency times it could not be that qu@@ arti@@ er@@ ates must stick a certain height of the towel @-@ holder or the size of the h@@ ack@@ ers .
for a temporary time &quot; not@@ ation &quot; would have to apply .
in contrast to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Konrad has to be working with his experience .
I am an elderly man , whom you don &apos;t say anything without doubt the face of the truth .
persu@@ ader power is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Mai@@ er cause the Republic to do no cost as they themselves declared .
her head@@ count would increase them to three to four .
to date his own qu@@ arti@@ er@@ search was not successful yet .
Konrad wanted to put a container on st@@ eph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
but there are apparently issues with permission .
Linz requires a better partition
not an opening of municipal sports halls and other buildings like tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for the accommod@@ ating refugees , the city of Linz is planning .
at the moment this is not necessary because the people without these measures could not contain these measures , as mayor Klaus Lug@@ er ( SP ) .
for the emergency , however , other locations will be inspected at their di@@ li@@ bility .
criticism of the soldier on the division of refugees in the federal state of the federal state .
other districts have to make their contribution here .
Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er : &quot; borders are not shown &quot;
in a longer telephone conference with the Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ehr@@ inger ( VP ) took up further performances in the refugee quot@@ as on Monday .
Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er has as@@ sures me that the German borders are not sealed .
the further trip of refugees in the Federal Republic of Germany remains also possible .
however there are now the corresponding border controls .
there will be no more special trains with refugees to Germany before Germany .
however , the protective seek@@ ers would be brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stir@@ inger also called more reinforced solidarity in the refugee quot@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that too , Austria has again gained controls on its borders , is a logical consequence , &quot; a logical consequence &quot; from the incident of the Germans .
the next R@@ unt@@ astic is a question of time
the refurb@@ ishment of the &quot; New C@@ ast &quot; in the Lin@@ zer Industrial Line is officially completed .
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT Group S &amp; T is listed , the rest ( 2700 square meters ) should be rented out of young , innovative companies from the technology range .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT , the smart head is our raw material , and we are trying to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; T boss Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could introduce themselves to invest in start@@ up companies of the New C@@ ast and later to be acquired too .
at the beginning , S &amp; T he wants to co@@ operate with the new neigh@@ bors - that at which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises a lot : &quot; the next R@@ unt@@ astic is just a question of time . &quot;
by S &amp; T , EUR 3.3 million were invested in the location , 3.3 million euros of the Tech@@ centre , comprising a third of the city of Linz , Upper Austria and the federal state ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is based on the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T as well as a Tech@@ center .
30 percent of the 2700 square meters of residual surface in the building have already been rented , for a further 40 percent give it in@@ quiries .
li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened second business in the Ark@@ ade
the Fur@@ la @-@ hand@@ bags are central in the new shop .
actually , Jutta Bre@@ it wanted to have a dog .
this project had to push back the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni into the Tau@@ ber market @-@ Ark@@ ade @-@ lived : finally , she has now gained an increase in the form of another business allocation .
in the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop opposite the business , in which it sells bags , suitcase , foot@@ wear and clothing of various manufacturers , everything is now possible to have ladies &apos; bags of the Fur@@ la , Wall@@ ets , starting from 75 Euro .
large bags and accessories costs up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
it has been rebuilt several weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have long talking about whether I should open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Bre@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
decisive for the decision was among others , that also the vene@@ er producers , which are in Bologna at home , from the idea of a site that was sold to only their hand@@ bags .
&quot; we are the only one in the large region of Linz , who sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters , which has Italian roots .
your fashion interest earned Bre@@ it in the cra@@ dle .
to me , most , when something developed and I can show new trends in low prices .
why some woman during the appearance of a beautiful hand@@ bag in decor@@ ating , too can &apos;t answer the specialist with the last security .
perhaps it is clear that a beautiful bag count every out@@ fit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ etter in K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pf@@ äl@@ zer &apos;s ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from one place whose inhabitants will be named stake .
this feature links some of the billi@@ on@@ aire that wants to become president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good .
whether he comments in a foreign language , the journalist Con@@ de calls or knowledge g@@ aps in international crisis policy - the applic@@ ants for the U.S. President &apos;s Council ag@@ it@@ ates strong commitment .
and slic@@ er good .
this is also registered in the shr@@ ine town of K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ ard .
the New York with the cr@@ ut@@ fr@@ ur is a lot in the wine shop on the wine @-@ road .
man@@ holes in the 1200 inhabitants is about -@@ zig corners with it is related .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Palat@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in campaign mode .
the town of Simone Wen@@ del turned to a movie over tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers about his aim to become the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that somehow found somehow , but they are not so pro@@ found in their own grass , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has shot a am@@ using documentary about the village and its famous spro@@ uts , next to Tr@@ ump also the ket@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts .
Tr@@ ump , who is not known for in@@ treat , comes in &quot; kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) also to Word - so with the statement that he might be certain also if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he did not bring it to the king of the heart .
indeed , respect for the performance of the family , but also ten@@ ds the opinion that Tr@@ ump &quot; was already a little mo@@ ck@@ le , &quot; says Wen@@ del .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if the nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is mentioned , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - zu Hoch@@ german : the trans@@ duc@@ er , says she . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the as@@ her .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 1885 when the later grandfather was emig@@ rate and opened a place for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
foundation stone of the property company was the first property sales in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free from teaching : you wish to return to the home in duration , f@@ ails at the Bavarian state to which the Palat@@ inate remained at that time .
he did not accept Tr@@ ump because he once was without permission , the Director of the Institute for S@@ äl@@ z@@ ic History and Eth@@ no@@ graphy , Roland Paul , was declared a film star@@ ring .
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of a &apos; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
this is in contrast to the mit@@ er statements of the night .
this had repeatedly spoken about Mexican immig@@ rants in the United States and requested the construction of a border against illegal immig@@ rants .
&quot; as the pol@@ isher , this is not so lik@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant transformation of Tr@@ um@@ ps ( &quot; The O@@ MA was a born Tr@@ ump , the Op@@ a was born in Heinz &apos; ) .
the win@@ em@@ akers in retirement sees the Americans rather dist@@ anced , &quot; he is always so fur@@ ious . &quot;
believed he that Tr@@ ump must come ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never car@@ es for K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;

seven &apos; s Sunrise domin@@ ates the reviews , despite attempts to accept the loss of leadership at the Today Show
Karl Stef@@ ano@@ vic and Lisa Wil@@ k@@ inson makes me to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report the loss of the leadership of the liber@@ als , but there has been no major shi@@ fts in the reviews for Today .
the breakfast show of Nine was broadcast@@ ed by the federal capital as a Mal@@ col@@ m turn@@ around Tony &apos;s message .
the Riv@@ ale Sunrise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ ths , discovered in London as part of a one week series of international TV shows , including Dubai , New York , Niagara Falls and Cancun .
this dis@@ advantage of the down@@ board seemed to play an Australian TV audience with an average of 39@@ 7,000 spectators at the five capit@@ als , compared with Today No. 33@@ 9,000 .
in Today , an easy boost to ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but his number was behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
Today revealed the gap to sunrise in the last months .
in August Today revealed an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 compared to the 33@@ 0,000 of Sunrise in August .
at the beginning of the year , the distance between 40,000 and 50,000 .
in September , Sunrise at an average of 34@@ 9.000 spectators at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in Today .
this is the most interesting thing happening every morning .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
revealed the secret ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki might have probably really surprising , who wins the Bachelor .
the woman , at the Sam Wood in The Bachelor , was covered in secret places .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not give up whether she is the one who received the last Rose .
but when we started with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows in the day before coming up to three two , you may probably notice a hint that will be the winner .
Sam Wood holds his lips until the final on Thursday , sealed
all three women have left themselves to Ly@@ ric method , why Wood the perfect man is and they called his mind for hum@@ or , amb@@ ition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be partner in their partner .
however , if the question is set . &quot; if not you , who should receive the Last Rose ? , &quot; might be your answers to the destro@@ ys who won the heart of the field .
Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both rapid - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as best partner in Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood showed a simple relationship between the first day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the moment , when I went to the house and ( Sar@@ ahs ) and Sam@@ s energies , I felt that they were fairly compatible , and I thought that in the entire course of the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Sarah stood at the feet on Earth , it makes a lot of fun together with her &apos; , added Mark@@ os@@ ki .
I have seen them together , and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that it would be well suited for Sam Wood as a pair .
from their point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the house visit went clearly last week that wood could be &quot; the one . &quot;
&quot; once I saw him with my friends and the family , it became clear that this is obviously not just a game - I am already pre @-@ kept on him , &quot; she said .
and when they were asked who would take wood , if it be not , then it was av@@ eng@@ ed .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said .
I love the remaining girls equally - it &apos;s a we@@ dge between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor will be broadcast@@ ed on Wednesday , 19 : 30 PM .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a thing that is now right , one takes care of the next game , and this is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne li@@ kened the rac@@ er with its Origin in 2007 when a passport led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land in its own in @-@ go@@ al@@ el region .

4 people killed after polic@@ emen of Gum@@ mig@@ ra@@ de to demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal , after the police demonstr@@ ating rubber , demonstr@@ ating against the proposed new constitution , an official official said on Wednesday .
violence broke out in the Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi district , about 175 miles ( 175 miles ) west of the capital city Kathmandu .
Bish@@ n@@ u Pr@@ as@@ ad Dh@@ ak@@ al , Head of Regional Court , said that over 1,000 demonstr@@ ators gathered outside a police station , some of them with stones and fire bombs themselves .
M@@ R Dh@@ ak@@ al said that police have used Tr@@ av@@ eng@@ as and then moved to the air before returning to rubber ra@@ de .
20 police officers and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the other rub@@ bers employed , of which it is known that they may kill , but traditionally used as a less dead@@ ly alternative , apparently made a high death rate .
the conflict was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nep@@ als south plains , where members of the ethnic group of Mad@@ h@@ esi say that new provinces , which would be formed within the framework of the proposed new constitution .
there were also protests in the western Nepal from the ethnic group of Th@@ arus that want to take part in its own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent conflict since the 10th .
in August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement , divide the country in the provinces - an important step in the direction of a new constitution , but a very controversi@@ al issue in Nepal had been ruled the centuries of century .

what exactly is happening on the estate is a hectare of the former restaurant , however , is still open .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to have a huge concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Behr@@ ever@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations which provide help for refugees and migrants : doctors without fron@@ ti@@ ers , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .

for easily overweight diabet@@ ics , weight loss can be helpful .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for easily overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last for a new study at least five years .
it &apos;s still too early to say whether easily overweight people with diabetes after weight loss medication is longer than those who received non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mortality data require a long time to show anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of weight loss surgery , who wrote an article on the new study in j@@ ama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
weight loss of waste operations or obes@@ ity , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s own ability to include food .
over the years , obes@@ ity has proven to treat type 2 diabetes as efficiently , but most studies have been carried out by people who are hyper@@ ob@@ ese using a Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ( BMI ) of 35 or higher .
BMI , a certain degree of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BMI of 25 or more shows that someone is overweight and people who have a BMI above 30 are considered low @-@ ob@@ ese .
you can calculate your BMI here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , researchers from Tai@@ w@@ an Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data which they have been collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of Adi@@ pos@@ itas @-@ Surgery - Mag@@ enb@@ rug@@ ge@@ es - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily overweight .
the average BMI amongst those in which surgery was subjected from 31 to 24@@ ,5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
however , the BMI with those who do not @-@ surgical treatments were equal to 29 .
among those who under@@ go a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes disease dis@@ band@@ ed completely and partially with 28 % .
in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , the medicine was completely dissolved in comparison with diabetes by only one percent , and in some cases by just two percent .
in addition , the results were tested during the insp@@ ections of the blood pressure , tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ des and the &quot; poor &quot; LD@@ L cholesterol &quot; in general , among the authors &apos; surgical &apos; group , the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored the blood @-@ blood level of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c which reflects blood glucose levels over time .
hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept by 7 percent , write the researchers .
after surgery the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c decreased by around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
in the medical therapy group however , it remained stable at around 8 percent .
but this better &quot; glyc@@ em@@ ic Control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - does not decrease the mortality rate in five years , so the leading researchers Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team maintains an average result of the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost weight ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , bigger re@@ trials in BMI ( 7.4 vs. 5.1 ) and hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and were rather a complete over@@ coming diabetes ( 4@@ 6.9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study did not show survival benefit after five years , there are indications of a recent survey in Sweden that operation leads to a longer life , &quot; says Black@@ stone von der University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study it was subjected to ob@@ ese people who subjected to an Adi@@ pos@@ itas operation , 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group of conventional methods .
although the new study was not advantage of survival in surgery patients , Black@@ stone felt it quiet@@ ly for persons with a BMI of 35 who are interested in the proceedings .
&quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BMI group , &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said .
in addition , Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should begin to take weight as soon as the patient is with his BMI between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we wait too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; she said .
I think once they have accumulated these genetic changes , which have attached their bodies with obes@@ ity and diabetes , is really hard . &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ r@@ ück
it is a theme that is present also in Bell@@ et@@ rist@@ ik : a young woman , at school times un@@ popular and un@@ mist@@ ak@@ ably , meets the breeding of her adolesc@@ ence after years , and this is in love with them .
so we recently published Roman &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally &quot; we are not so &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der .
beyond the love story , the novel could be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ rep@@ lication readers , since he plays in Lang@@ we@@ iler and the neighbouring villages .
the German professional author grew up in Lang@@ we@@ iler , and is looking forward to providing a literary monument to their home .
&quot; it &apos;s impossible that anyone can come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
Europe could not return all refugees , he said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution of refugee crisis in the Middle East was lying .
the Tibetan Buddh@@ ist leaders advised to termin@@ ate violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama was the problem of ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the beginning of his 10 day visit in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford which focuses on Eth@@ ics studies .
he demanded that in the given circumstances should the interests of humanity be provided to the interests of each nation or even continu@@ ity .
he also stressed that the reaction of West European countries to the refugee crisis is ad@@ mi@@ red , but the situation is not reasonable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that anyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama &apos;s Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to keep the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; in order to worry about several thousand refugees , is wonderful but in the meantime , you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as real peace and real development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; he stressed .
ultimately , we must think about it , as the killing in their countries is reduced .
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the application of violence has never solved these issues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama said the problem of violence and commented upon George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack on September 11 and turned out that the violent reaction of the United States went to a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my supplement to President Bush in a letter and I told him the way to solve this problem in non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know , his moti@@ ves were good , but he put on violence , and that caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four times increase from intake of ham@@ lets by children in the last 4 years
plaster control centers in the U.S. report on an almost 400 percent increase in number of children under 12 years of age , which swal@@ lows strong alcoholic drinks , such as Georgia Po@@ ison Centre .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord L@@ op@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenue yields in children under the age of 12 increased from 3,@@ 266 to 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; children are increasingly being more common in these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go back to the record , &quot; L@@ op@@ ez CN@@ N &quot; said .
he said that some children of disinfect@@ ant can be drunk while some are doing so for im@@ press her friends or because of a mut@@ ed sample at the social media .
how to show videos on YouTube , how yo@@ ungst@@ ers drink only because of a cheap experiences .
yo@@ ungst@@ ers have mixed disinfect@@ ant with alcohol content water to receive a har@@ der drink .
younger children can be encouraged by attractive sc@@ ents of disinfect@@ ant .
&quot; a child does not remember that this is bad for it , &quot; said L@@ op@@ ez .
many of the more attractive ( hand @-@ disinfect@@ ant ) are those who are par@@ ked .
there are disinfect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and or@@ ang@@ es that are very appe@@ aling for children .
ham@@ let disinfection included somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
particularly with infants , only few sprit@@ zer can result in alcohol po@@ is@@ oning .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medi@@ cally director of the call centre at the University of Kansas , the Fox Fox 4 in Kan@@ sa City .
so , you would leave no si@@ p whis@@ ky to stand , but people leave this hand disinfect@@ ant in reach of children , and if children come from it , then it &apos;s a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ ja Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who recently had four syr@@ inge from following straw@@ berry inf@@ ectious disease in the school , was brought into a emergency picture .
her blood alcohol was 179 , twice higher than the threshold that was drunk by a adults by law as a child , said Dr. Chris R@@ it@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor , who treated them at the G@@ win@@ net Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah started her words and was unable to go to the place when she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors super@@ vised it overnight in a separate children &apos;s Hospital on the signs of Hir@@ n @-@ trau@@ ma because the girl had fallen by the alcohol and did the head uncovered , R@@ it@@ ch@@ ey said .
&quot; that was very anxi@@ ous , &quot; said Ort@@ is@@ Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ ahu &apos;s mother , CN@@ N .
it would have been fatal for my child .
L@@ op@@ ez has recommended both parents and teachers to use alcohol free products or disinfection services outside the range of the child .
in addition , some disinfect@@ ants are connected to death by alcohol po@@ is@@ oning .
in 2013 , two women died in Ontario in Ontario , not declared a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient .
employees of health authorities prevent the product of me@@ thanol , a dead@@ ly solution , rather than grain alcohol , which was recorded as active ingredient .
in January plan@@ ed three pupils in the fourth class in New York State , their &apos; school teacher &apos; po@@ is@@ oning , po@@ is@@ oning anti@@ bacterial products around the class@@ room , &quot; says a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic against ham@@ lets . she named them from their room .
the police related to the se@@ cul@@ ated plan as &quot; D@@ w@@ ät@@ z &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; the disciplinary action taken at the school authority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Vill@@ ingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged
a 33 @-@ year @-@ old driver has been viol@@ ated slightly in a dri@@ v@@ eway between Nor@@ dr@@ ing and on Her@@ on .
a 60 year old truck driver went on the cross border in the direction of the industrial area and too late , that at the roundabout , had predicted two expected vehicles .
in the wake of the evening he played with his lor@@ ry to the stern of an audience and whether this vehicle is a per@@ verse license by Ford Fi@@ esta .
the deaths resulted in an accident of about 10 000 Euro on the accident that were incur@@ red by the police .

I don &apos;t think we feel at pressure , I think that the players are looking forward to .
the lack of tit@@ le@@ - competition in Scottish football - de Bo@@ er
the former Leader@@ ers mid@@ fiel@@ der and earlier National Player of the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Cel@@ tic since there is no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the rank@@ ings .
de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; in Holland , they show no highlights from the Cel@@ tic Games more and why ? &quot;
it is because the Rang@@ ers are not there .
people don &apos;t talk only about the return of the Rang@@ ers .
they talk about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that &apos;s what they interested .
there is a lot of tension in the Old Fir@@ m games , and there are not only those people who want to see these games .
I will turn the things , swe@@ ars D@@ eil@@ a .
R@@ onn@@ y D@@ eil@@ a did accept that Cel@@ tic must go fight , but the Norwegian boss can refuse to turn these things .
after the defeat against Malmö and the subsequent retirement from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 men from Aberdeen , who now stand at the top of the table with five points , will now stand at the top of the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ eil@@ a said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cel@@ tic had many times before , and we will come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know , it is very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happened .
we feel it exactly so - but we must continue .
we really need , really the support of Cel@@ tic , because that makes the players better .
now is important is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton c@@ auti@@ ously with January @-@ transfers
despite his comments prior to just a couple of weeks before he pointed out that he is a couple of January @-@ transfers , Leader@@ ers Boss Mark War@@ bur@@ ton is carefully remin@@ is@@ cent of the signing of new arrivals and insi@@ sts that it would not distur@@ b the unit of the I@@ bro@@ x @-@ Ka@@ ders .
the ex @-@ CEO of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; the January @-@ way window is very different from the summer window . &quot;
the players who come in summer , have this pre@@ season time to integrate , what you have seen with our own group in this season .
the team is really good .
sometimes more damage is done , by adding un@@ necessary players what you really need .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a Derby , and there was the heat of the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the stor@@ ms , said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is certainly to say that I don &apos;t have to Ty@@ re here if it is not for Cel@@ tic Glasgow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Mc@@ Inn@@ es happy , against Hamilton , &quot; un@@ just to win . &quot;
Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es guess that his team had to fight against Hamilton Ac@@ side , in order to see a seventh consecutive league , who brought them a lead of five points in front of Cel@@ tic at the top edge of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ on@@ ey@@ s El@@ f@@ meters in the first half of season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no crew , who has won everything in poker games or le@@ agues that won &apos;t won any games like this species . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the United Kingdom it will rise .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 in the period from May to July , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom increased as a whole in the same period by 10.000 to 1.@@ 82 million .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate was 5.9 percent above that of the U@@ K@@ s by 5.5 per cent , as the figures for the National Statistics Office ( dating only by the ONS ) .
meanwhile , employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 during the three months , with the number of employees at 2,@@ 6@@ 12,000 .
the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent over the course of the quarter - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
the Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot;
it is almost exactly one year ago that Scotland has made the historical decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
in these 12 months , we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment .

why I become a Exec@@ ution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
a somewhat later , except in late intervention , I will see how a man is put to death .
when it happens , and I hope that it is not done , I will sit in an audience gallery in the ob@@ itu@@ ary of the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is ec@@ lec@@ tured by using tox@@ ins .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
the invitation was already mentioned for the first time in January , over his best friend , and although I was sho@@ cked , I voted .
when the day came closer , I began to fear me .
so , why should I do it ?
I voted because I thought it would be a good opportunity to tell the whole story about death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists can be seen in the United States , and since often more applic@@ ants are available as seats , a ma@@ iling lot@@ tery will take place to decide who is chosen .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media slots from 12 to five .
who is selected , we can observe the emotional .
I cannot do that .
I will sit next to Richard Glos@@ s@@ wir@@ l eng@@ age friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with telephone data and a two and a half hour visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh much when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so it will not allow me to take a not@@ ebook and a pen in order to draw up what I see .
I just have to try to remember all details .
a journalist in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me of asking myself on Twitter , my im@@ part .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner , as he wants it and you will receive access .
I compl@@ ained about her .
you dream they could not form@@ ulate it , &quot; but it still th@@ inks that it is wrong , what I do .
Richard Glos@@ s@@ p had problem with some of the things I said and written .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I said to him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants us to present an international repor@@ ter to write there .
when he dies , he th@@ inks that the public relation of movement is to be made against the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , another repor@@ ter at the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will be sitting next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the Pod@@ casts series that I have made .
I don &apos;t want to return to all details here .
I can &apos;t say that Richard Glos@@ s@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assassination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would be guilty of seeing him to be a crime @-@ doing .
but I believe that there is a strong probability that he is not guilty of murder .
I ensure that there is no sufficient evidence of justi@@ fy a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective , I will see him die .
I can &apos;t claim to be really obj@@ ectively .
there will be other repor@@ ters who can contact you .
what you will get of Me is what it means to see a man &apos;s un@@ necessary death .
man to mo@@ ist police @-@ persec@@ ut@@ ables are talking to escape from the C@@ anning River
the anning of the C@@ anning V@@ ale police was dry when he over@@ spoke the man of the C@@ anning River .
an attempt by man of Perth , the police was deser@@ ted , was un@@ successful when he was found in the submitted and sum@@ p@@ able water , just a few meters from a police officer , who tried to persu@@ ade him to return to the bank . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was sum@@ mon@@ ed to a house breakdown in Beck@@ enh@@ am on Tuesday .
when they discovered the susp@@ ects , he tried to escape to them in the direction of C@@ anning River .
but he did not get too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in the water and she said &apos; I am not come out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ le@@ dine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not all too enthusi@@ astic about doing his uni@@ forms - therefore he turned a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good policy is negoti@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ le@@ dine .
championship football player Ben Coffee sins provides an unforgettable example .
in 2006 , cou@@ sins made his car in the tr@@ ench to escape a alcohol control and then tried to swim via the Swan River .

Peter Moody claims that st@@ ew@@ ards tried to discover it and threat@@ ening to finish the racing
Peter Moody claimed that the st@@ ew@@ ards of Racing Victoria tries to install a sp@@ y in his st@@ ables and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he moved to the st@@ ew@@ ards and the integrity division of Racing Victoria and maintained that they carried out a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate Sc@@ rat@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai on a race @-@ day treatment to the last Stro@@ h@@ hal@@ m in Wednesday .
Moody &apos;s Fair@@ fax Media that he has always tried to do what is best suited for racing and he himself found himself under difficult conditions , as it was about the positive co@@ b@@ alt @-@ t@@ up@@ fer@@ sample at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain .
he had held back for 18 months in due time of the sp@@ y court and did not want to see it as too high @-@ hanging grapes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say anything to it , and I have long enough to eat , but at times you are fru@@ str@@ ated that everything came out at one time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moody . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it had gone far@@ ther .
sometimes you re@@ acted , and one needs to live with the consequences , and I have to live with it what I said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I would like to pass up@@ lifted up , and I want my owners think that I try to try my best .
if they begin to think , I do not do that , then I should not be a coach .
I have to consider what I do with my license .
prior to that , Moody &apos;s got the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ist , that the integration section had attempted to blend its stable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eigh@@ teen months sat Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart in a room with a man - I &apos;m asked if I &apos;m asked to do something about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said Moody on Rac@@ ing.com . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they obviously believe that I am a sc@@ amm@@ ers .
if that &apos;s the case , they should definitely take hold of their n@@ oses , because they tried to hold me because of their attempts .
Robert Rou@@ te@@ ston , former chairman of Route L , David Moo@@ g , reig@@ ning president of Route L and Bernard Sa@@ ar , current CEO of Route L , were aware of its time and are still today .
should I bring it to the view that it is personally going to be personally ?
does Route L celebrate it and make people responsible outside the trainer for doing what is going to do in the industry ?
am I not so bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think there outside that I am it .
perhaps they have to take my license and cast me off , and I have no doubt that what I say is to think about it now .
but I arrived now at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad .
it really makes me sad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I will ex@@ ert the print on them and push it out to make a decision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the fru@@ str@@ ations @-@ lev@@ eling of the train@@ ers went up with the long @-@ lasting co@@ b@@ alt test at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the son@@ ata Sc@@ rat@@ ching did that he could not throw up his license on the table . &quot;
Moody , best known by his preparation of the unknown artist Black C@@ avi@@ ar , best@@ owed the race @-@ treatment rule &quot; ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous , &quot; after a package of sl@@ ud@@ ge or sound was applied to the hor@@ semen .
&quot; it is against the rules of racing sports .
I have to take responsibility for it , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of my colleagues didn &apos;t swal@@ low a bu@@ ck upon the leg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was evening so night .
yesterday , it would have been the whole day that something was .
but it had like so on the racing day .
Moody could con@@ fron@@ ted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the package on race day . a study of this matter has been opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing of the horse .
&quot; we all see that we will need rules , but here you go too far , &quot; said Moody .

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy spread against ri@@ vals for claims to fight back
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has critic@@ ising criticism at the Tac@@ kling his player as &quot; Agenda @-@ Set@@ ting &quot; from two Premier League favorites in the N@@ RL .
Sydney Roo@@ sters Coach Tr@@ ent Robinson stated that the arbit@@ rator gave the Storm @-@ players &quot; f@@ ancy &quot; with his team during the high Storm Victory in the qualifying finals in Sydney on Friday evening .
Brisbane Bron@@ co Coach Wayne Bennett was a hard @-@ down note regarding the Storm team , after his team had won the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Rug@@ by League &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land did not &quot; too good &quot; in the rings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ amy def@@ ended the tac@@ kling climate of his crew and said that they are only concentrated on their &quot; contact &quot; in the Tac@@ kling .
Bell@@ amy added that the cr@@ iti@@ que of two leading coach at his crew was confident that they wor@@ ried that they were wor@@ ried out of the Storm team .
&quot; that turns out again - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about ring@@ strug@@ gles , when they struck us 24 : 2 , &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday .
I can guarantee that we have changed anything in all year by our def@@ ensive system or the techniques . however , in the last six weeks we have made our contact with tac@@ kl@@ es to a real focus , and this has achieved for us the turn@@ around .
Tr@@ ent is now there for three years , and he obviously has a great team to train . he is therefore not willing to lose it , so it was a bit a lap for him .
it is already com@@ ic as this time back to this time of time .
Bell@@ amy spread the idea of &quot; thr@@ illing football &quot; and rec@@ alls its ment@@ or to rec@@ alls that Benn@@ ett St George Il@@ no@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with a &quot; long@@ tail &quot; football .
Wayne talks of thr@@ illing football .
he compared his game on Saturday night with our evening on Friday evening and how exciting her play was , &quot; said Bell@@ amy .
I remember that in 2010 St George was a bor@@ ing team critic@@ ised , and Wayne said that he would take care of a she@@ ath .
but now he has a team that can play and watch it as exciting , particularly his young players with their speed .
that is the ball game that you would like to play if one has such kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all its kind of football - not each team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt , so they can play them as they play .
I build confidence , because they say these things , because they are a little wor@@ ried about to play against us .
six weeks ago they didn &apos;t think about us when it went around the Big Games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the Storm against Roo@@ sters scored a higher result than the game Bron@@ co against C@@ ow@@ asser .
the game of the Bron@@ co was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two further trials in our game but is that an exciting game ?
or are breaks , and no points some ten@@ sion@@ ing ?
it &apos;s the blu@@ epr@@ ints for me .
when it mention us , it means that we will continue to meet in one phase .
the Storm team is free from this weekend since it won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks on the next Saturday evening at A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin from next service tomorrow .
Serbia with 200,000 $ deposit upon drug add@@ age
a man , possibly a li@@ fel@@ ong sentence is threatened by selling 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , which have been w@@ asted after Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a b@@ ail of $ 200,000 .
Marko Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men that were arrested last month after the Federal Police got 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , who arrived in South America on V@@ anu@@ at@@ u and in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed , as he was accused of his co @-@ def@@ endants during the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite a potentially li@@ fel@@ ong sentence for an attempt to own a commercial amount co@@ ca@@ ine , argu@@ ed that there was no evidence that he tried to have the whole amount and that could have been a harm@@ less reason in the café .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was concerned about the threat of fluctu@@ ation in Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic .
he gave clear relationships with Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia , he declared the court on Wednesday .
in case of pen@@ alties , he weighed the police on his place of residence .
Mak@@ si@@ mov@@ ics mother and boots had a deposit of 200,000 dollars as security offered together to reach his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the ins@@ om@@ al explanations of the two persons it is clear that the circulation of a $ 200,000 minimum has been a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Richter said Flan@@ agan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it won &apos;t be enough to hold it out for nothing , he war@@ ned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was freed in b@@ ail , under the terms that he gave his Australian and his Serbian passport to call on the police every day and at an output block from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .

a ped@@ oph@@ ile used the telephone of an 11 year old girl to demand pictures of child abuse .
Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the phone of the girl as this slept when she slept in an online @-@ Mess@@ aging Service , from which he received an array of un@@ an@@ ised images of children who were sent to him from another user .
the girl wo@@ ke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping h@@ og@@ g .
she looked through it , found the conf@@ using messages and al@@ arms immediately her mother .
the police looked like this and saw the five pictures , then gave the computer that were found under the address and discovered &quot; web research , the terms for searching for in@@ cess@@ es images of children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ og@@ g then claimed to officials that he would have done it , as it would lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ped@@ oph@@ ile &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be a polic@@ eman to make it afraid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bar attor@@ ney at Eil@@ id@@ h Robertson told the Dun@@ de@@ e Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be a su@@ ck that he was ad@@ dic@@ tive to make people troubled .
he admitted that the sear@@ ches were done on the computer of him , but said it was to be done , because he tried to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ out the ped@@ oph@@ ile .
he was asked after his talks with the unknown person to send him the pictures and he asked to send even more photos .
he said that he did to temp@@ t them .
he said that He was sick in the head , when he drinks , and said that he would see images of rape and murder .
MS Robertson said : &quot; when the girl got the news on the phone , she called her mother , and was on the cit@@ adel and the crying .
then she also looked after in@@ constant images on the phone and con@@ fron@@ ted the accused .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused computers and Play@@ station used to talk to girls who saw a lot younger than he died .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the defence attor@@ ney Gregor S@@ im asked that H@@ og@@ g appears not in the register of sexual offen@@ ders since you could argu@@ ed that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in its deep@@ est &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff A@@ list@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael shifted the verdict through October to obtain background reports about social work .

he was added to the date of the judgment in the directory of sexual offen@@ ders .

cars from the compact class are currently being asked : about 28,@@ 1 percent of new appro@@ vals accounted for about 28,@@ 1 percent of new appro@@ vals , according to the Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) in August alone .
this is also reflected at the International Motor Show ( Audi@@ ence Days 17 to 27 September ) .
this year , many new compact models will be presented between all the fut@@ ur@@ istic design and luxury cars .
one of the biggest premier@@ es for the German motor@@ ways is the Opel Astra , who will stand at dealers in the autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel Group CEO Dr. Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair .
he belongs to the core of the brand .

J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meter cell is in@@ worthy of human
the Federal Constitutional Court has given a former ex @-@ det@@ ain@@ ee of the pyramid of Te@@ gel law that has been accommodated in a small cell in the months .
because of the violation of human dig@@ nity , det@@ ain@@ ees generally did not receive financial compensation if they are accommodated in small cells .
this decision has taken the decision by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision on Wednesday .
the levels of suffer@@ ers may even hope that if they were not imprisoned for a few days in the close spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
this was a ex @-@ det@@ ain@@ ee with its constitu@@ tional@@ ity in Karlsruhe : it was accommodated in the pyramid of Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel in a single cell with approximately five square meters floor space ; the toilet was spati@@ ally separated .
after that , the man who re@@ located to the information desk is now un@@ locked there , in a larger cell .
his term of liability because of the innocent conditions against the Land Berlin fail .
however , the Constitutional Court uph@@ eld the judgment of the Chamber of Commerce in Berlin and instructed the case towards a renewed exam .
they see the human dig@@ nity of the man .
chamber court decide on level of the compensation
even if legal reasons for legal reasons only a few days of liability for the in@@ dem@@ nity is a decisive factor for compensation , it was supposed to be a compensation .
otherwise it would be &quot; a sal@@ v@@ ature of the legal protection of the personality . &quot;
the chamber court must now clari@@ fy the amount of money con@@ formation .
the constitutional provisions have often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past .
they didn &apos;t say in April of in@@ mate to in@@ dem@@ nity , because he was imprisoned in a cell in prison .
human rights un@@ worthy is a decision of 2011 according to the multi@@ purpose single occupancy of a cell without a separate toilet .
Moreover , on Wednesday , the Court of Justice also confirmed the Berlin Court of Justice , which had a det@@ ain@@ able housing in a parallel incident in November 2009 .
the then pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff took over three months , between 15 and 21 hours , in the same cell as in Karlsruhe .
the Berlin pris@@ ons entered the head@@ lines in recent weeks also due to lack of personnel .
prisoners are therefore always shut down for 23 hours , but the aggressi@@ vity is increasing , it is due to the cl@@ amped situation .
according to information from the judicial press office , 21 positions in Te@@ gel are not occupied for young defect , 19 will fall in 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we are creating the &quot;
the immig@@ ration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or is determined to accept them .
what to come to Germany ?
according to the forecasts of the Federal Ministry of Finance , some 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers come to Germany in this year , according to the testimony of Vi@@ zek@@ anz@@ ler Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) in Germany even able to ad@@ mit one million refugees .
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) demonstrated in the presence of the unusual challenge : &quot; I say again and again : we can do that , and we can do it . &quot;
what comes on Germany gives you the following overview .
they are needed to produce different forecasts , ranging from 3@@ 50000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Finance ) and 400@@ 000 ( estimate of the Pest@@ el Institute ) apartments every year - and that for the next five years .
that &apos;s almost twice as much as previously built ( 25@@ 0000 apartments ) .
dramatic is the lack of living space but especially in affordable rental objects : yearly fall 600@@ 00 to 800@@ 00 social apartments from the rental rates , and around those particularly favourable apartments will also apply for refugees .
Federal Minister for the Federal Minister for Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) will therefore dou@@ bling its funding from 518 million to one billion euros .
much too little is that from the view of the Pest@@ el Institute : 80 000 social apartments have to be created annually , and this would have to invest € 6.4 billion a year .
in addition , scientists and Federal Minister de@@ pri@@ ved that there must also be more tax advantages for investment in housing construction .
it is estimated that , according to estimates by the institute for labor market and professional research , 55 percent of the poultry may be employed in Germany .
however , the refugees in Germany were not systematically alle@@ vi@@ ed after their qualification to help them with Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann @-@ Stiftung .
for the integration of refugees , however , deci@@ ding whether they will find in Germany .
work is the key for social contacts , for the appreci@@ ation of the admission &#124; but also for the self @-@ est@@ e@@ em of immig@@ rants , says Mig@@ r@@ ations@@ for@@ scher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt .
in Germany , according to Tab@@ l@@ hardt , it has been discuss@@ ing a political turn@@ around : the for@@ b@@ ade for refugees to receive work .
while there has been a working ban for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the resi@@ den@@ ces that asylum seek@@ ers to a place of residence .
in society - also because of the recru@@ itment of professionals , a majority of vision is set to be ensured that refugees should be able to increase access to the labour market .
a great hur@@ dle for access to the labour market are missing German .
up to now , there is no sufficient offer to general and useful language courses .
research also shows that jobs are most frequently convey@@ ed by personal contacts .
the structure of networks is therefore the view of Thr@@ än@@ hardt the König@@ s@@ weg .
the Berlin school management has established that only a few @-@ fle@@ dged parents have their children to the Kit@@ as , estimated to meet ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the root @-@ root parents , it is only very important to coinci@@ de with the family , &quot; says Il@@ ja I@@ was@@ bar , spokes@@ man for youth and family in the Senate department .
to convince the family from the advantages of the K@@ ita , this product was distributed in various languages .
should the demand of educ@@ ators strongly increase by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase their training capacity - around , increasing more professional schools .
students without German , students will be prepared to lessons in the countries .
they are not always taught by teachers and teachers , but , as in Berlin , also of teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language .
there is no lack of evidence , says Be@@ ate St@@ ates from the Berlin School of school .
the German student union estimates that some 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany .
prin@@ cess , no Bundes@@ land As@@ ylum Con@@ clu@@ ded or Rem@@ ar@@ ising the Study - the only exception was to be Berlin , the inner part of Frank H@@ emisphere ( CDU ) , however , abandoned its position now .
study agreement can be facilit@@ ated for the higher education institution .
for refugees have been allowed to organize or dul@@ ent , they receive no performances in accordance with the asylum seek@@ ers Act more if they begin studying .
the latter is generally not given B@@ af@@ el@@ g since they fall not under the circle of those entitled to those entitled .
to date , Ged@@ ul@@ un Refu@@ ge@@ es had to have lived for four years in Germany to be eligible for B@@ af@@ ö@@ g @-@ entitled , and had been shortened to 15 months from 1 January 2016 .
but also this financing gap shall be closed , Steffen Schröder , Berlin@@ s State Secretary for Science , and the German student union .
the students should receive immediately B@@ af@@ el@@ g .
Islam will continue to play a major role in the future because many refugees are Muslims , and many are the religion important part of their identity .
the state should oppos@@ e the same rights to Islam as they have the churches and the existing state @-@ churches right to develop on to a new state of religi@@ ons .
it would also be the establishment of a islam@@ ic state association that car@@ es profession@@ ally around the new@@ com@@ ers .
you are also duties of the rights .
thus , the representatives of Islam must some clear contacts , some and ready to gather together with the state in many areas and to grant certain control options .
one also belongs the read@@ iness to prepare for religious foundation anch@@ ors .
the president of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed the concern , religious conflicts could also be registered in Germany too .
those who wanted to go such conflict in Germany , &quot; would immediately have their right to stay there , in Germany , he said , &quot; he said in Bay@@ erische Rundfunk .
he tried to translate the Basic Law to Arab .
integration will be much more in the future than today a theme throughout the society .
in order to change its majority society , the reduction of discrimination and rac@@ ism is the same .
indeed , as a result of European decisions - as a result of European decisions - an anti @-@ discrimination law and a general Gender Equality Act .
but it was very slow to show how the NSU motorbike series showed , in the police and authorities , the rac@@ ist motif were systematically igno@@ red .
equal opportunities for all : what mig@@ rating organizations and stak@@ eholders are for a long time request and for the purpose of what international agreements like the anti @-@ terrorism interests in Germany must remain true in the coming years , when the country remains peaceful and its citizens should use their possibilities - the sole of all .
in general , Germany has been able to medi@@ ate medical to the so far @-@ expected refugee , Frank Ulrich Mont@@ gom@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding Man@@ - Power and Capacities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do we create this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the daily level . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money must be flowing into the system .
to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ gom@@ ery needs to be consumed at all customs of health by the regi@@ ster@@ ing .
these services could be calculated later with the Länder .
and in the long term it is highly frag@@ mented to meet so many people with the limited performance catalogue , to view the asylum seek@@ ers Act .
otherwise , the doctors perform especially the language barri@@ ers .
so far , the Berlin @-@ based health schol@@ ar The@@ a Bor@@ de has been identified , migran@@ t migran@@ t drugs will be en@@ ligh@@ tened upon their disease as other patients .
not only in clinics , also in medical practices would have to be accepted in interpre@@ ting , calls for them .
many refugees have been helped with even more general medical trials in emergency out@@ ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic view .
in refugee children , there will be much more untreated disabilities , and with the yo@@ ungst@@ ers there go about HIV @-@ En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment .
with the partly different cases of disease , German doctors arrive at their training but consider Mont@@ gom@@ ery .
&quot; paras@@ ite fall or tuber@@ culosis are not so difficult to recogn@@ ise . &quot; and for what the medical angel is concerned , the refugees even ob@@ serves its alle@@ vi@@ ation in sight .
the Syrians became a highly developed education system , some refugees even doctors .
in order to do practic@@ ed , they would have to prove their qualification and ur@@ gently nour@@ ished examinations .
at least half of the refugees in Germany is psych@@ ically ill , according to the Federal Minister of Psycho@@ therap@@ ist ( B@@ Pt@@ K ) , most of them suffer from post@@ trau@@ matic regulation or depression .
in particular , Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ Pt@@ K , explains .
a recently published study by the TU Munich announced that every fifth Syrian refugee @-@ cow mat@@ ised in Germany .
who is suffering from post@@ trau@@ matic mal@@ ign@@ ity suffer , amongst others in the so @-@ called Flash@@ back with breathable air , Schwin@@ n , pal@@ pit@@ ations and death cases .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders , strong terror and emotional re@@ ty .
in order to prevent the symptoms usually be chronic , having a early treatment , Mun@@ z declared .
yet , only four percent of the psych@@ ologically ill refugees get a psycho@@ therapy .
though psych@@ ically ill asylum seek@@ ers can provide an application for psycho@@ therapy in the social media , but the processing usually takes several months .
furthermore , in the social offices usually have bonds or doctors who are not trained for mental illness , whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often lead to false ass@@ ess@@ ments , says Mun@@ ster .
Man@@ ege invites for dreams
with the new st@@ aging &quot; passion &quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst goes back to tradition of cir@@ cus artists .
the goal is to attract all age groups within the ban of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atic , wildlife and c@@ mali@@ zer entertainment .
now the cir@@ cus in the Man@@ ege ranges upon the bricks of bricks .
&quot; our passion is the Circus &quot; .
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst , veter@@ inary teachers and junior women .
&quot; passion &quot; - under this motto is the actual production of the actual production .
for more than 33 years , the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the families of the family .
the gift for enthusiasm is the family in the blood of the family .
&quot; we are important to take away people from their everyday life and take it for two hours in a completely different world , st@@ resses the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ per .
&quot; Man@@ at cocktail with world seat fl@@ air , &quot; he is the name of Reinhard Pro@@ bst .
this fl@@ air can now experience 50 cities on the nearly 3 000 kilometers long tour .
the Circus is convinced by talented folk artists from all over the world .
awarded at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ ok@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family draws the audience with joke and charm in her husband .
including the Cast@@ illo Brothers , their craft business also understand .
with the heroes of the Stum@@ m@@ films , the Cub@@ an Duo wants to come on .
light@@ ness and mobility - with these words they identify themselves .
their hum@@ orous film on the mast should capture women in the storm .
apart from a lot of laugh@@ ing , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of Circus Pro@@ bst is also fur@@ ther@@ ed with finger@@ tips and happiness .
to use a ball on a ball ?
for He Yuan no problem .
sn@@ ake and troubled at the same time .
Wang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics as little others and fascin@@ ated with their mobility .
60 employees from twelve nations provide diversity in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; emphas@@ ises Steph@@ an@@ ies Mutter , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
abuse during the attitude of circulation are only too often regarding different animal protection organisations .
Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst also takes a position : &quot; if we are not good for our animals , it also does not work well . &quot;
approximately 80 animals from five different continents enjoy every string unit .
the &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged artists &quot; as they have been lov@@ ingly called , will be read in the eyes of every request from the eyes .
we plan to work with the animals and have fun with them .
the animal doesn &apos;t feel good , neither does it go to the ring .
so the top commandment so : good for the animals .
specially on their Zeb@@ ro@@ id Jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land@@ Pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a Zeb@@ ra@@ st@@ mare , the family Pro@@ bst is proud .
the two animals lived in one enclosure for eight years and nothing happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , suddenly our little jum@@ bo is , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brigitte Pro@@ bst &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Zeb@@ ro@@ id is not ready for the Man@@ ege , but this is the unique mas@@ cot of Circus Pro@@ bst .
so there should be something for each visitor .

Sim@@ bab@@ we@@ es Robert Mug@@ abe holds false speech in the Parliament
M@@ R Mug@@ abe , Africa &apos;s oldest , marked the stairs in the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case spread rapidly beyond the social media .
the opening of the Parliament also revealed by asser@@ tions of members of the Left that they had received anonymous death thre@@ ats and war@@ ned them to accompany the address of Mr Mug@@ abe with Bu@@ h@@ let .
last month they had hat@@ ched him , and in his speech delivered to the State of the Nation in parliament - this is the speech , which he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man for the movement for the democratic change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) Inno@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven Opp@@ os@@ itions politicians have received SMS messages on their cell phone that they war@@ ned , Mr. Mug@@ ab@@ es Address .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but she told the title &apos; death &apos; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said repor@@ ters in Mug@@ ab@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it war@@ ns the affected parliament members , that the immun@@ ity is ending in parliament , and once they leave parliament , their parliamentary immun@@ ity is no longer effective .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the spokes@@ man said that Morgan Ts@@ is@@ gi@@ ra@@ i managed to run the Party &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about d@@ angers for the politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard is up to 30,000 jobs
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard is expected to offset 25,000 to 30,000 jobs during restructuring and savings effort to serve the company &apos;s services .
hp will split into two listed companies this year , and the computer and printer shop will separate from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and its service activities .
the expected job reduction led to a load of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , HP announced in a declaration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable calculation structure for the new Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard @-@ enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chair@@ woman and Chief Executive , who is to lead the unit after the separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP today , and we have a wide and deep@@ est portfolio of shops , which support companies at the transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man .
as an independent company , we are better than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise has more than 50 billion annual revenues , and will be focused on providing an in@@ exhau@@ sting technology solutions for businesses , such as an explanation of the company .
it shares a company that was founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hew@@ lett and Dave Packard , whose Palo Alto garage was called &quot; the birth@@ place of Sil@@ icon Valley . &quot;
hp has under@@ gone a massive re@@ structure to tackle the return of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
the HP of HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US @-@ tech company , is the latest in this area that is based on the belief that narrow focused companies generate better performance .
FC Arsenal @-@ captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team mates remain behind the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the past Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
W@@ enger stressed as Wil@@ sh@@ ere , that it runs until September and if his rehabilitation after schedule , there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere is sure to miss at least the next four games of England and , in view of its history , his participation in the next summer at the European Championship is certainly un@@ certain .
the great dis@@ grace in this current issue is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had strongly ended the last season after a separate ank@@ le assault and then returned to his old swing during the pre @-@ season .
&quot; this kind of injury not threat@@ ens the career , &quot; said W@@ enger .
it is a bone , who healed not well .
this is not a matter .
this was just an accident .
it did not stand in conjunction with his an@@ kl@@ es or with the injuries that he had before .
this may be true from pure medical point of view , but as w@@ ret@@ aining , there is the associated serious threat of other injuries , whenever a player tries to return to the heart of the season .
it develops an un@@ pleasant pattern .
Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different disorders of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in the last five play@@ times in only 65 von Ar@@ sen@@ as 157 Lig@@ as@@ play .
the wider picture of ar@@ senal is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six of eight playing time since 2007 / 08 , most of the injuries amount .
W@@ enger accepts the potential of a Teu@@ fel@@ sk@@ il@@ ises , but Arsenal &apos;s believed that an improvement in the danger ratio has lasted during the last season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , if you come back from injury , you have a lack of time , a time where you need to strengthen your body and fight combat , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ enger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
jack is young enough to overcome it .
I hope that his body stabil@@ izes , I &apos;m confident that he will do it and he will run a career of the way he deserv@@ es .
Arsenal starts his Champions League @-@ season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of games against Chelsea du Saturday and Against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ lane next Wednesday , and W@@ enger introduces himself a rotation within the team .
Lake H@@ é@@ ctor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not travelled to Croatia , meaning that Math@@ ieu Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta will begin to start le@@ eta .
W@@ enger can also begin with K@@ ier@@ z Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ ro@@ ud instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; I try to keep balance and make the players who need it , a small sn@@ ail off , &quot; said W@@ enger .
although Arsenal &apos;s hand , Arsenal &apos;s left hand , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb belongs to the play@@ fields with the biggest bay effects in Europe .
Dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 games after the &quot; unexpected &quot; campaign was launched last season .
the stadium was sh@@ aken by an earthquake on Tuesday , whereby the Richter scale was 3,2 on the Richter scale .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
W@@ enger is the opinion that Arsenal had drawn the lesson from the last season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation about Monaco and remains from far hope , with his management the association lead to his first European Parliament triumph .
&quot; this drive is immen@@ sely , &quot; said W@@ enger .
it never stopped at the ar@@ senal .
we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in the business to be realistic .

friendship : the com@@ edy show , which grants us over serious lessons about complaints @-@ friendly messages
the absence of similar represent@@ ations in Shows is apparent , especially with respect to how the need for men to open oneself , now more des@@ per@@ ate than ever before , as self @-@ mo@@ dr@@ ates among young males can prove on a 15 @-@ year high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in males at the age of 20 to 45 , and it remains more common in men than women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , the Campaign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ections ( CA@@ LM - Campaign against a erb@@ ese life ) 2015 marked the year of the man , aiming to ask the culture in question , who need to hin@@ der them when they need them .
friendship is the heart of the heart in order to master this challenge .
a recent study at more than 2,000 high @-@ school students with de@@ pres@@ sive symptoms suggested that if suff@@ erer has a suff@@ iciently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy atmosphere , &quot; its chances of recovery has doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , hal@@ ved a circle of mentally healthy friends the risks of mental problems .
but of course one must only have friends to work for a friendship .
in the age of over social media communication , with emphasis on style on substance , the in@@ ability of response is often more important than a meaning@@ ful contact .
our digital life have the need to be strong , fun and successful , even if in fact the isolation is dominated .
this su@@ perf@@ icial success is dominated by what psychiat@@ rist@@ s ex@@ tr@@ ins@@ ic values call ; money , image , social status , everything on costs in@@ tr@@ ins@@ ist values - our inner desire sear@@ ches according to personal development and friendship which acts greatly in our spiritual health .
and like a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire talking recently , money can really not buy .
the beauty of friends was that this focusing on the head was taken .
every character was not defined by his work but by his personality , the interaction as a friend sh@@ one .
hum@@ or of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler frequent h@@ ugs , Mom@@ ents at football matches in cozy arm@@ chairs and the lon@@ ging of Ross to Rachel - all this came out of the knowledge that men can rely on any case , even if they often have with@@ hold their feelings to explore .
as a employee of the phone past@@ oral care told me : ... &quot; my ro@@ cking role for people who are de@@ pressed and threatened by self @-@ com@@ ic , has really shown me how even the smallest inter@@ actions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us feel often not in the position to talk with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old phr@@ ase &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come along with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect like the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows which comes to me in the sense when I try to offer long @-@ term consciousness mechanisms .
she clearly presents the little moments of garments friendly .
so very my objective external lateral band status via phone calls for people in eye sight of desp@@ air also help , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you &apos;re on this weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ ship feast with the celebration of the day totally redesigned setting , why do you not take your friends back to a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better , if you got in Star@@ bu@@ cks anyone alone , give it a smile and say hello .
one never knows what difference might make your friendship .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the entire 236 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ feast
di Mary hits that PS@@ G is helping to grin@@ d to Malmö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ i@@ di and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani with his suit against Malmö .
di Maria hits the Champions League at his debut in the Champions League at Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to hand in Malmö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani started course when Paris Saint @-@ Germain started his Champions League &apos;s season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malmö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park stadium on Tuesday .
di Maria made less than four minutes after the launch of his Champions League Deb@@ ates as PS@@ G players who brought the French master to the way , but afterwards they missed a number of occasions before they finally increased its lead , as Cav@@ ani took a head@@ ball in the 6@@ 1. minute .
with real Madrid and Sch@@ acht@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A you need a strong start against the Swedish champion , because it is not only the qualification for the K.@@ O@@ .-@@ rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter @-@ fin@@ alist in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they received the points , it was not a class example of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Z@@ lat@@ an Ibra@@ him@@ ov@@ ics missed chances in front of the gate . he was later abandoned in the game against his home @-@ town team and against the club , which he began his lively career back in 1999 .
&quot; it is not easy to win at home or downhill towards the Champions League . thus , it &apos;s a good start , 2 : 0 to win our opponents , even though there are certain things we have to be perfect in the course of season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; this is a good sign .
we wanted to win and we have won , although I &apos;m sorry that we don &apos;t have one or two other gates . &quot;
Ibra@@ him@@ ovic returned to Paris after his violation in one of three changes to the Paris team , that could withstand a 2 : 2 un@@ tie at its own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but it was kick@@ ed out in the fourth minute by Di Mary .
the Argentin@@ ean wing of shut@@ ters was referred to as the man , whose PS@@ G was going to take over in the last month of Manchester , when he ran across the Malmö defense behind the Malmö defense , before he passed to Johan Wil@@ and past beautiful in the long corner of the network .
however , if anyone believed that PS@@ G would get a major win , that was dis@@ ap@@ pointing .
Malmö , the Cel@@ tic in a Play @-@ off proposed to reach this stage , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was excited with a five @-@ man @-@ defense and two deeply in the mean field was heavy opponent .
but besides a shot from Nikola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic who was far to Kevin Tra@@ pps P@@ fo@@ sten in the 34@@ th minute , they had little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G even had sometimes on , with some mis@@ sil@@ es and bad degrees , not least of Ibra@@ him@@ ovic , who was handed over to him less than five trials in the first half of which Cav@@ ani was used after rest@@ art .
nevertheless he proved much more skill , when he brought his competitors into the game , and it was a pass of Ibra@@ him@@ ovic , who was buried at the pole of Wil@@ on in the 5@@ 2nd minute ...
the second gate finally fell shortly after the hours of mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . at this end , the Urugu@@ ay@@ ans scored his sixth part of the season after Ibra@@ him@@ ovic had wi@@ ped up one left flan@@ k by Max@@ well .
this finished all thoughts that Malmö could return to the game , and only an excellent intervention of Wil@@ t from shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , could stop the end result of low before the replacement player E@@ ze@@ qui@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi has been recognized in the end .
the trainer of Malmö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , gave later to that PS@@ G played a class about his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was in December last year .
since then , we played only in the Swedish League that has not the same level .
the quali@@ fications are not enough . &quot;
hat starting from Paris !
it was a great game of them !

Detroit Tig@@ ers hit on Minnesota &apos;s Twin@@ s
MIN@@ NE@@ HE@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not very fun for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
once again it was one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers stand on the last square in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as Sp@@ o@@ iler , but this role played a perfect match against the Minnesota &apos;s array with 5 @-@ 4 on the target Field .
the Twin@@ s sent a chance to climb up to Houston Ast@@ ros for the second round of the Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League @-@ card @-@ Platz .
for Detroit , if even for one evening , it was a return of the three letters F @-@ word , which was a difficult part of it for a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all victories have fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad P@@ mus .
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Alfredo Simon held his early offensive support , as it starts three times in the first two inner positions , then once in the sixth and then once again in ninth place .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) fought 6 times in 1 / 3 inner rooms and made three cents .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to finish this year &quot; I said , &quot; Simon .
it &apos;s tough to throw in the bul@@ lets of each game , and so I will concentrate on going into the game .
the designated Tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z designed three hits and was in two rings , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three @-@ hit game in Mart@@ ine@@ z , since then he had four hits against the Seattle Nav@@ al on July 6th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he made the impact of wood well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at the ( stroke training ) , looked much better from the bul@@ lets , and he put it directly into the game .
with three R@@ uns at the end of the 7th inn@@ ings , the Twin@@ s had their best chance to come back to the game .
center F@@ iel@@ der Byron Bu@@ x@@ ton completed the inning by a double on the left field line .
the Right F@@ iel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks reached a bun@@ ch , and Simon presented his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zer to the Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the Bla@@ zer blade Bla@@ y Hard@@ y .
Hard@@ y over@@ ran Wall , the single man , faced with whom he con@@ fron@@ ted , before serving Rook@@ ie @-@ Schlag@@ mann Miguel S@@ ano , who has won a Two @-@ Run during the turn @-@ in Dre@@ w Ver@@ h@@ agen .
with a pair of runners and the finale @-@ run at the second brought ver@@ h@@ agen the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe at a Double Play .
it was the major league of the 27th time in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe struck a Double Play .
after Detroit added an Insurance Run at the end of the ninth , a R@@ B@@ I double against the C@@ loser of Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and scored the stand 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ handed , S@@ ano with three pit@@ ches came from three pit@@ ches for the fifth row .
Detroit benef@@ ited for the start of the game by a non @-@ moving Phil Hug@@ hes .
the tig@@ ers raised three organs in the first two inn@@ ings against the handed @-@ held veter@@ an , which was canc@@ eled before the game before the breaking list , after he had missed out more than one month ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously not the beginning that I had w@@ ished for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hug@@ hes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I felt and felt that I would get some good pit@@ ches in the third inning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after first received the Le@@ ad@@ off @-@ Bat@@ ter in the first of the Le@@ ad@@ off @-@ Bat@@ ter , H@@ ush@@ es gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ ger .
a Two @-@ Out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into the game that made a single &quot; up the middle &quot; during the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z abolished his 0 @-@ 21 success with the Run@@ ners in the sc@@ oring position .
the third B@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos with a single at the right side managed another run but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he was trying to get to get the third .
the tig@@ ers went on in the second , one one @-@ out double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single from Center @-@ F@@ iel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose to the 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; this was a great blow , &quot; said Twin@@ s @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ ded .
he was not so well beaten , but he caught up the right spot .
Hug@@ hes had been found in a pitch @-@ count , yet no points scored in the third inning before being replaced by the Reli@@ ant ro@@ bes A.@@ J.@@ A@@ viewer .
Hug@@ hes joined us with six hits and a walk with four Stri@@ ke@@ outs .
notes : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP An@@ i@@ bal San@@ chez was the case of an injury to the puppies .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the shoulder from San@@ chez in 2007 .
San@@ chez , since the middle of August on the po@@ ign@@ on list because of a shoulder @-@ confusion , should be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with S@@ án@@ chez from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris is kn@@ itted by Daniel Morris from the injuries list to start the Twin@@ s .

Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz .
on Wednesday , the presence of the town president Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino has been baptised to the name of the German re@@ ators in the park on the Opp@@ io @-@ Hill in the park .
at the Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , he is now honoured as &quot; the German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot;
the park lies right in the heart of the ancient Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nom@@ en@@ cl@@ ature had been made in Rome by the Work Community of the Protestant Churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , past@@ or of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Rome , rec@@ alled that the Protest@@ ants were often able to live in the town of the Pop@@ es over centuries as a minority .
in this way , it is visible in a symbolic way that the tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) spent a young August@@ inian mon@@ k for the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 some months in Rome .
he receive the city at that time as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sinners &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to hist@@ ori@@ ans , his negative impressions had em@@ bol@@ dened him in his future fight against Rome .
Luther was then led by its thes@@ es against the precip@@ itation trading into the split of the derived church .
hammer Artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus ( gold @-@ plated ) Dor@@ n@@ enk@@ rone is one of the main works that has made Ot@@ mar Alt for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has updated the introduction and Bible tex@@ tured .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which has now been published with magnificent paintings .
at the beginning the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who in 150 moti@@ fs had formulated his very personal interpre@@ tations of biblical stories on paper and canvas .
his &quot; language &quot; with colourful colors and f@@ anci@@ ful shapes has got the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but what no means is syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; images .
on the contrary , the relevant issues can be adapted , that is quite remarkable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; about three years Ot@@ mar Alt worked on his bi@@ ble project for which he has received a sub@@ jective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; book of all books &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are cycles that dev@@ ote topics like the way of the way of the cross , pl@@ agues , commandments or pat@@ ern@@ ity .
it is therefore fascin@@ ated by several partners : this is the same time for the Luther publisher with his the@@ ological alignment , as well as for the Kettler publisher with his focus on art books .
and this is especially the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , based on painting with the respective passages .
he interpre@@ ts an interpre@@ t from Ot@@ mar Alt in the Bible and thus translated into the latest connections . &quot;
these lyrics are like verb@@ al mirror of Al@@ ts painting .
it is nestled between the original Bible study of Martin Luther and each of them a sentence of the artist that formul@@ ates his whole personal thoughts about the situation here .
the jew@@ ellery band has golden let@@ tering .
thus the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows to have a deep insight into his soul , its emot@@ ion .
this is a high degree of in@@ tim@@ acy .
E@@ mot@@ ions were finally trigger for the bi@@ ble project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in W@@ ern@@ ig@@ er@@ ode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant powers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the up@@ bringing started with the cane floor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ mar Alt re@@ members &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tried to compos@@ e it , that I may also bear the Father together with the Lord &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second call is , the art in faster time to more significance : &quot; the perception of images listed today is l@@ ame from Rek@@ l@@ ame , and that is no@@ isy .
Sym@@ bo@@ lic is displac@@ ed there .
artists have a different desire and del@@ ights , things to show .
images always have some secret people and are not decorative .
in this regard , I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt would like to leave the viewer in the images &quot; to let them work , discover and feel the force they have : &quot; the picture looks for his counter@@ part . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost opens on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar Alt @-@ Stiftung in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts art . &quot; I like to know how he lives with his photos . &quot;
old did not remember the Bible completely to capture the Bible , but which was important for him also mysterious issues .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was no co @-@ operation at eye level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ep@@ ost : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what the pictures , the lyrics explained &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from Luther &apos;s Verlag , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life to deep@@ en and freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Images speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love as well as the responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and sheet images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition which will be opened at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung on November 15 .

football respon@@ ds to the p@@ inion location in Germany and sec@@ ures policy to help resolve the issues related to vulner@@ able problems .
&quot; I observe the greatest challenge of our country since the re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in principle , no one can say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think anything , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this has to be interested in every individual interested in the grip , &quot; said DF@@ B Head Wolfgang R@@ Nier@@ s@@ bach .
during the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to intensi@@ vely discuss the refugee situation in Germany .
&quot; I am next Wednesday in the Chancell@@ ery and meet the Minister of State Mrs. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ uz and Chancellor . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll be sure to play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the football could help and wool .
but the decisive turn@@ outs must now make politics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is why the German Football League has made its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Stiftung , we have ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kidney clean@@ se declared at the edge of the UEFA meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some states support this program .
already on this weekend , the 36 Pro@@ fi@@ del@@ ays place a clear sign when she meets the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We Help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of the other popular &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tri@@ k@@ ot@@ ok@@ mel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Hermes ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make clear that all will help , where and how they can only do , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen Sport@@ head Rud@@ i Völ@@ ler &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Tuesday ) and recorded the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ intelli@@ gi@@ bility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the refugee &apos;s drama goes back every year , nobody can see . &quot;
&quot; we can &apos;t be football @-@ speaking , no , we need to use our jet power , our influence and our possibilities to help many refugees who have been so incredible to help , &quot; said Her@@ tha manager Michael Pre@@ etz &quot; said .
Hoff@@ enh@@ ei@@ ms Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent symbol of the League . &quot;
on Friday , the team of Women &apos;s Women &apos;s national team invites 100 refugees to Halle / Saale for this Friday .
Nier@@ s@@ bach supports the support of refugees as &quot; a large common kind of German football . &quot;
that all 36 license units have started their own projects in their places was great .
the very great is that small and smallest ampli@@ fication are active .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we spent in the football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; that is of enormous importance , &quot; he said .
in this and next year , the association together with the DF@@ B selection and the federal government produces 300 000 Euro for the integration of refugees .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is almost extinct , was a great way , and then dra@@ g@@ ged out to the street . he told us last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ IW@@ O &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Plat@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in early October we meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Plat@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is able to be involved in the meeting and &quot; fully working . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Thursday ) , he will come back to Germany in October and will continue to support the software group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am full of SAP , full of my job . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course I stood in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and the chairman Has@@ so Plat@@ ner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t der &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was important to him to go to the public with such a personal history , the manager of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can happen . &quot; &quot; &quot;

football : Bv@@ B without Re@@ us against Kras@@ no@@ dar : consec@@ ration in the gate
at Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund , we finally beat all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us in the first group game of the Europa League .
the national player is also missing at the table leader of the football player in the Du@@ el with the F@@ RP Kras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19.00 / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot look back on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether Re@@ us will be on Sunday in the Bundesliga top@@ play against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the Bv@@ B coach was open : &quot; we expect a return from him to Friday . &quot;
in view of the high pressure of his pro@@ s , Tu@@ ch@@ el is not only able to change his tri@@ pp@@ le position on the Re@@ us position .
so he announced a change on the door@@ ke@@ over .
this is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller uses the place of family art@@ ender Roman Pet@@ l@@ ki .
&quot; he trained at an absolute top level , &quot; the football @-@ teacher becomes the world champion .
whether Wei@@ den@@ f@@ ist was able to play in the future of all Europe @-@ league games , Tu@@ ch@@ el made it open .
with high probability , he will also contest the second game .
the for@@ ged testimony of Mit@@ ch Re@@ us , that the fin@@ al@@ entry for the Bv@@ B in the Europe League will be the target , holds a mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian W@@ eig@@ l for subsequent : &quot; this is not so wrong . &quot;
&quot; I think we have a good chance to access the title . &quot;
Ro@@ bots : government wants to act as a pione@@ ering role for Germany
according to the will of the federal government , Germany is said to be on the change of the car technological prec@@ urs@@ ers .
the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the house of Transport minister Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which invites investments into the expansion of digital infrastructure .
Do@@ dec@@ dt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the Autom@@ at IAA in a &quot; new Mobil@@ e@@ Control Age . &quot;
the automated and connected transport will increase the traffic reliability and ensure less st@@ ems , Do@@ eg said .
it also wants to discuss the subject also with his counter@@ part from the G7 states that come together with representatives of the industry .
the strategy of the Federal Ministry of Commerce emphas@@ ises the importance of the mobile broad@@ band extension and a spe@@ ech@@ ing h@@ up@@ lift on digital radio stations .
testing new technology is currently taking a test route on Highway 9 in Bavaria .
thus the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus want to check the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; legal framework &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus to the driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to verify the legal framework &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so Germany wants to use internationally , that the maximum permissible speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle will be increased from 10 to 130 km / h .
in addition , the Federal Government also aims to deplo@@ y an amendment to the Vienna Convention , which has so far been able to be able to test people as a driver .
when automated driving takes over the car the guide , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger .
the technology is primarily based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
highly automated driving on motor@@ ways would be technically possible by 2020 after one of the German Ministry of Economic Affairs .
nevertheless , ri@@ de@@ less vehicles on public roads were to be expected only by 2020 . &quot;
the value added in the area of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions in Germany will appreciate the authors of the study by 2025 to around 8.4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of the trucks can lead to more safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ ör@@ en Bart@@ ol &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD traffic artist S@@ ör@@ en Bart@@ ol &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability in accidents and personal data of the driver must be clari@@ fied clearly .
but the German self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle however sk@@ ep@@ tic@@ ly - much more than the French or American .
a vote on Wednesday at the AA pre@@ set survey of the For@@ sa Institute in order to obtain that only eight percent of Germans believe that aut@@ y@@ om @-@ driving cars will be crossed over the next ten years , 32 percent are not likely to think 31 per cent at all .
in France , 21 percent of respon@@ dents say to 2025 with auto @-@ driven vehicles , 33 percent in the USA .
in Germany , drivers in Germany are not ready to come on self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle in Germany .
after a survey by the digital band B@@ IT@@ KO@@ M , only seven percent would agree to leave the control throughout the drive on all roads .
on the motorway , at least 15 percent could imagine , at St@@ au 45 per cent .
well every cl@@ one would leave the car under no circumstances .

Gaul@@ tier feels to be old for a enf@@ ant .
it is a mixture of a brand of great fashion show and a qu@@ es@@ li Gr@@ us@@ el@@ kab@@ in@@ ett : designer Jean Paul Gaul@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : show display man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins , which thanks to video projection will look human .
they bring the spectacular cre@@ ations of the French designer , amongst others , with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits the great star of the fashion scene - and that he put men in coats .
&quot; I can no longer say that I am the enf@@ ant of the Haute Cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously , it &apos;s really easy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gaul@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors to the exhibition &quot; From The side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen from the 18th of September at the Kunsth@@ alle of the Hyp@@ o @-@ Cultural Foundation , it is a happiness that the fashion fire has changed its first sitting position on his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually he had been against it , for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me a show a bit after death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you come to the museum .
the impressive collection had already done back to the Montreal and Paris station in the summer of Paris .
&quot; it is so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren .
it is tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the man &apos;s hard looking at an over@@ looked work of man , which has ever made an apprenti@@ ces@@ hip as ever .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not built , but it is an excell@@ ently chore@@ ograph@@ ed grand plant that was operated for a much effort : to raise the d@@ olls , for example , a styl@@ ist was hired for example .
14 tons of material used the makers according to the Cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot to Munich .

also Gaul@@ t@@ ers old Teddy is also able to see in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , z@@ ag@@ rem@@ ely fashi@@ onable p@@ aces of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good male and po@@ or@@ ly in football ) , he attracted his Teddy B@@ HS and dresses , said Gaul@@ tier .
he has not allowed him to play with a doll , his parents have not allowed him .
throw away from fashion he later taught himself .
he st@@ ole fashion magazine and saw the designs of other designer , like Gaul@@ tier in Munich .
later I bought it , of course .
for his first own fashion show he cannot pay the models .

jewelry instead of Gard@@ ine - Pl@@ au@@ ener tip as fashion @-@ niche
formerly it went on to the long embroi@@ der@@ y machines in and around Pl@@ ots on it , feet .
the embroi@@ dered materials and heads were made in large amount to customers , for example to cover ceilings and curtains .
today the alone works no more , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of the mo@@ bs seats .
instead the mode is important .

in the last 15 years about 80 percent of sales are broken .
private business transactions and wholesale are almost no more .
our products will hardly reach our customers on this way .
today the mass media is far produced in the Asian region and is almost exclusively sold in chains .
they are also weak from exports , currently to Russia and in the United States .
there are plenty of reasons for new ways .
the industry association tried to score also through environmental awareness of how C@@ ord@@ ula was explained by the Em@@ broi@@ der@@ le in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; this year we lead a seal of quality , that shows us to produce ecological and soci@@ ally . &quot;

to opposite the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
that needs time and courage .
there is a voltage panel between the refresh@@ ing ideas of designers and the establishments that have to think primarily economically , &quot; says Schmidt .
therefore , an existing design often varies only slightly to keep an customer base .

EU wants to double mercury limit value in smoking
the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large cat@@ fish and consumers make a far higher dose of the nerv@@ ous .
the consumer organization F@@ ood@@ watch , who is an appe@@ aling business paper , critic@@ ised the plans in sharp : &quot; risks and adverse events failed with full force of pregnant and infants , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch .
Wolf@@ sch@@ midt plans to estimate limit values of ner@@ ve gi@@ es for large fish at the end of the food chain such as Hai@@ - or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish from &quot; economic policy reasons &quot; from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram of fish .
large pir@@ ated fish are already heavily imp@@ aired with mercury , that on the basis of the still force limits , about 50 per cent of the length may not be sold .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.5 percent would have been dis@@ cour@@ te@@ ous .
in return for this loos@@ ening , the EU wants to convert the limits in other f@@ ishes from currently 0,5 mg to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram .
F@@ ood@@ watch described this as &quot; Tri@@ ck , &quot; because smaller peace @-@ fish , such as car@@ p mostly imp@@ acted so low that they already comply with the planned maximum values today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is why the decrease of plum@@ age is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ dition of the de@@ fle@@ ction maneu@@ ver that only the economy helps &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a highly toxic heavy metal that is strongly in@@ adequate over the food @-@ chain mainly in smo@@ kers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government therefore war@@ ns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; low quantities are particularly likely to cause damage to the nerv@@ ous system of the nerv@@ ous system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Ministry of Environment declared itself on its homepage with regard to the relevant maximum values , but that a &quot; health haz@@ ards of the general population is &quot; not expected . &quot;
mercury is made especially through coal combustion at the environment .
according to a written information about the Federal Ministry of Environment , the German coal plants rose by Ann@@ alena Ba@@ er@@ bo@@ ck more than six tonnes of mercury in the year , two @-@ thirds of the total electricity produced in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish approximately in the Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permanently and widespread &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had quoted from paper in March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past year in Europe , al@@ arms ahead of mercury in fish have already reported the frequent health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
