Washington critic@@ ises the ongoing Sett@@ lement of Israel and th@@ rows Net@@ any@@ ahu , man@@ ited will at the peace process .
the deal of the Iranian nuclear program caused by Obama to deterior@@ ate the relationship between them .

in a emergency call , Professor , his gir@@ l@@ friend shot to have shot
in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ annon says with a loud voice of the police , that he had shot his gir@@ l@@ friend and that the officials should come to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lamb has been important to emphas@@ ise that his &quot; sweet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was still alive and probably he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
within the house , the officials of A@@ my Pr@@ un@@ iss and a handwritten note , which was critic@@ ized on a white block , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who loved me . &quot; this was by the authorities in the letter , and it was signed from Lamb .
there was no notice that Lamb that had travelled in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , has already set up 300 miles to the school premises , where he had been shot and killed by the police , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office and killed .
Delta State University of Poli@@ gra@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that this fellow worker would have heard about 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb has taken away the fat@@ eful emergency after that .
until the end of the day there was another death : he took the life when the police attacked him .
one day after shooting in the university , students and lec@@ tur@@ ers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to pro@@ cure a picture of what is thought out .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , such as those who know , did know , helped him to draw a picture of an talented , but probably difficult teachers .
students said that they were looking forward to his teaching .
the police in G@@ auti@@ er , where he died , he did not have a history of violence or a criminal record .
Schmidt himself mentioned in a book written in him , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people , &quot; which he mentioned his academic lives .
both educ@@ ated in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose teaching staff includes 17 members , and many students visited courses of both .
at the same time there were some in@@ clin@@ ations to problem@@ atic behavi@@ ors .
a student , Bran@@ don Be@@ avers , who gave hold out Lamb , he seemed to be a bit excited and nerv@@ ous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had done with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
in the previous year , the Delta State University had asked for health reasons , and said that he had any other health problem .
in this year he taught only two online courses .
the latest changes in the employment policy of the university significant that the promotion , for which Lamb had worked so hard for him , would not constitute a way for an automatic way to an employment as Assistant Professor .
the President William La@@ For@@ ge said , he was ignor@@ ant of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was a little Mr Lam@@ od presentation . &quot;
these are questions that you can not answer anymore .
after the escape from the campus , the police found a track later , when he went back to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi in Ar@@ kan@@ sas .
before he was arrested , he killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about one mile south of his parents &quot; home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner meth@@ el Johnson .
his car still ran in the entry level .
it was not immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said that she knew that he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew in the area .
Lamb started out in 2009 at the university , the 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants , and taught ge@@ ography and ped@@ agog@@ y .
he received his doctoral degree in education .
one of the long @-@ term friend@@ sl@@ ate lam@@ bs awarded him as a intelligent , char@@ ism@@ atic and fun .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said , she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met together with common friends .
they and their friends were at High School , and he was the cool old guy who tried to accommodate the guitar player for a couple of years .
it was then the B of B .
all girls are melted away when he was there , &quot; H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson &apos;s suburbs of Bran@@ don .
Lamb and Pr@@ un@@ amm@@ ate were obviously some time together .
in the emergency call , &quot; I have killed my wife , &quot; but there was no certificate from a marriage .
they had a dog called Light@@ ning who lived with them in the back@@ stone house , that ad@@ joining a Ba@@ you in G@@ auti@@ er .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband von Pr@@ un@@ iss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were fe@@ eb@@ u@@ ed 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter that was now 19 years old .
&quot; she was totally destroyed by the floor , &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said about his daughter .
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he has never met him , but he heard his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail that Lamb was interested in music and playing the blues .
in 2005 , Pr@@ un@@ iss , when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail met both on a summer @-@ mill@@ ennium before three years .
later they played together the one or other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he writes his daughter and s@@ ings their own music .
Pr@@ un@@ iss was a nurse that worked for different companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ keeper and sometimes entertainment coordin@@ ating at The Jul@@ ep Room , a slight brigh@@ tly illuminated bar in the night of 5th september for the last time He had ended his guitar and harmon@@ ious example before an unforgettable audience .
there was no evidence that anything would not be voted .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were on the premises and jo@@ king together .
I mean they had both a good point for kid@@ ding .
Schmidt , the t@@ ote professor , led the first semester programme and specialized in American native people and colonial history , Don Allan Mitchell , a English professor at school .

8 survey data suggest that Donald Tr@@ ump is seriously .
some have tried to see him as a flop .
others have done it as a joke .
and some wait for one collapse .
but no matter how many rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to move Donald Tr@@ ump from the top edges on surveys , it has not worked ( yet ) .
ten of the last eleven national surveys presented Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some will begin to seriously ask what it means for the od@@ ds of the real estate @-@ Mog@@ ul@@ s .
of course , it is too early in the elec@@ toral period .
nobody claims that Tr@@ ump probably won the Republi@@ can Nom@@ ination .
experts acc@@ entu@@ ate that during this time in 2011 Rick Per@@ r@@ ys Gui@@ ded tour to the emerging Ambassador Cain , one of which won only one state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he should have a general election .
but outside groups like J@@ eb Bus@@ h@@ s Super P@@ AC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognize tr@@ um@@ ps eradi@@ cation and start their dollars to overthrow him .
here some current survey data indicates that the real estate to Mog@@ ul is not only a temporary phase :
tr@@ um@@ ps requirements have turned 180 degrees .
just before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his candi@@ dat@@ ure in mid June , a survey of the Mon@@ mouth University revealed that only two of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans have seen the real estate @-@ Mog@@ ul .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August , it was 52 percent .
now six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ s have a positive view from Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three of ten say that they have a negative opinion .
and these figures keep in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa has established last week that 60 percent of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a good mind of Tr@@ ump .
two @-@ thirds of GO@@ P elec@@ tors were happy with dump when candidates .
in a pol@@ l of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of the rep@@ ublic@@ ans , they would be either &quot; enthusi@@ astic &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; when Tr@@ ump was nominated .
only two of 10 say they would be &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if he was the candidate .
only Ben Car@@ son manages roughly the same enthusiasm like Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent , they would be &quot; excited &quot; vs. 40 percent , who would say the same about Tr@@ ump ) .
the next thing in enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio is only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters think they are &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the Est@@ abl@@ ishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans see the temperature of ours not as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for his st@@ icky and bel@@ ong@@ ated statements , 52 per cent of the rep@@ ublic@@ ans of Irish voters think the real estate to the real estate to act as ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is in the first selective state of the nation , the State of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans think that he has the personality to a Commander in accordance with Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
however , 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to be effective to perform effective work , and almost six of 10 trou@@ bles say that his temperature does not sell into the White House P@@ asse , ABC / Post .
Republi@@ can elec@@ tors acc@@ ust@@ omed to the idea .
when they set up their money , republi@@ can voters are Tr@@ ump for real .
if they are asked , who wins the GO@@ P nomin@@ ee , say after a pol@@ l of CN@@ N / OR@@ C from the past week four of ten that Tr@@ ump was the best bet .
this is a change since the time when four of ten received their money to J@@ eb Bush from the end of July .
full publication : GO@@ P elec@@ tors had not seen the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
at this point in the last cycle , four of ten rep@@ ublic@@ s thought that Rick Perry would win their nom@@ ination as opposed to only 28 % for the final candidates Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , it shows that a variety of GO@@ P @-@ elec@@ tors &quot; is being used as pl@@ au@@ sible . &quot;
even when Rep@@ ublic@@ ans gathered some other candidates , Tr@@ ump still strikes nearly everyone .
some experts point out that the spl@@ itter@@ ing field probably contributes to Tr@@ um@@ ps guide , during the Anti @-@ Tr@@ ump support to spread over a dozen of other candidates .
but a survey of the Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ thet@@ ical head @-@ to @-@ head @-@ race between tr@@ ump and most other republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump was harvest@@ ed the majority stake .
he left Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points ahead of him , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Casino and Chris Christ@@ ie 33 points .
it is a head @-@ to @-@ head with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who strikes him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypo@@ thet@@ ical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a press majority of Donald Tr@@ ump @-@ fans says that they have formed their mind .
a new survey of C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of voters who support Tr@@ ump , they say that they have not taken their voices .
of course , much can be done to change that , and nobody can really say never the opinion .
46 Per@@ cent said they open the door to change to other candidates .
yet , Tr@@ um@@ ps is the strongest competition for the other outside , neuro@@ sur@@ geon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who have formed their mind , are twice as frequent in tr@@ ump .
six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ s to coinci@@ de with Tr@@ ump on the topic of Im@@ migration .
since then Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign first mentioned two months of immig@@ rants from Mexico &quot; rape . &quot; the immig@@ ration and fishing point in the public dis@@ course was in 2016 .
some are concerned that the atomic fact explo@@ it by Tr@@ ump of His@@ p@@ ano @-@ Americans by the Republi@@ can party and will be disappointed with the new orient@@ ated efforts .
but after the new ABC / post @-@ survey of Monday , six out of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans have to coinci@@ de with drop@@ ping questions of immig@@ ration .
so long as the immig@@ ration remains in the lim@@ it@@ ight , Donald Tr@@ ump was also to do it .
the fru@@ stration over the government clim@@ bs up to new high@@ s .
on Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , about half of the support of Republi@@ can voters falls above all by their outer side status .
six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ s say in the New Fl@@ ags @-@ Survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political field of affairs as someone with government experience .
and they are angry with Washington .
a survey conducted by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Bloom@@ berg in I@@ owa presented two weeks ago that three of four I@@ owa Rep@@ ublic@@ ans are fru@@ str@@ ated over the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in the Congress , with 54 percent &quot; un@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; pol@@ itic . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential buildings in Germany
here in the Hob@@ oo@@ ken@@ weg you find the most expensive community with view over the North Sea .
in the street , a square meter of a hom@@ eless house is on average 7@@ 3.@@ 300 euros .
&quot; on Sy@@ lt , the product range is limited to objects , &quot; means it is in the study - therefore the high price .
a new study shows that , in which particular layers are a square meter most cost .
of course , 18,@@ 70 Euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top dwelling , one of the price comes as pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate provider Angel &amp; Ful@@ c@@ ists released a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square met@@ ering prices in narrow @-@ thr@@ illing places .
there are several ten@@ ths of a thousand Euros guaranteed - per square metre , well noticed .
but good , who can aff@@ ord it ...
by the way : Munich is exceptionally narrow here .
Champions League : Bavaria @-@ dream kick @-@ off thanks to Müller and go@@ dd@@ ess
the two @-@ fold Tor@@ cher in Pir@@ raeus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller has a run .
he achieved a successful hit by Thomas Müller along the way of FC Bayern 3 : 0 at the Olympi@@ ak@@ os Pir@@ ee - then ran it .
a sover@@ eign start to the Champions League @-@ season .
the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze celebrated a dream start to the &quot; mission of Milan &quot; with FC Bayern ( FC Bayern ) .
the team of Trainer P@@ EP Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won their first match in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ak@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to the double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and id@@ ol@@ at@@ ry bes ( 8@@ 9th ) with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth star fol@@ ks in Serie is scheduled to be the first step towards the final on 28 May 2016 in Italy where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola wants to bring the h@@ im@@ pot@@ ence to Munich in the third attempt .
Müller at his 28 hits in the Champions League at the Bavarian leadership of Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto , who will pass through a Flanders of the World Champion .
&quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate it , &quot; Bayern @-@ captain Philipp Lah@@ m had promised Philipp Lah@@ m in front of the game in the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 amazing fans - and the Munich @-@ held word .
they showed a concentrated and committed presentation to shine without shine .
Pir@@ ate had won his youngest six exercise games in the Royal class , including young clubs like Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 he met Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
but the Bayern , in seven Europ@@ ac@@ companies du@@ els with Greek teams were un@@ defeated , didn &apos;t want to be the next sacrifice .
they had cour@@ age@@ ous ran , but with their offensive efforts , but often d@@ art@@ ed to work .
attacks were often headed by playing on left side Douglas Costa to the left of the left Braun@@ schwei@@ ger Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ aou@@ i rarely .
Müller had a little more luck , when his Flanders from the right @-@ ball in the left Upper To@@ re@@ ck struck .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion given the possible 2 : 0 .
the best opportunities in half are Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
initially , as the Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer Brown finished the pil@@ ball of Poland ( 26th ) .
then by direct withdrawal , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto with the kne@@ e ( 3@@ 5. ) .
although the Bayern moved its acc@@ ust@@ omed game , Pi@@ raeus could set up con@@ i@@ fers .
in Tor@@ ben@@ ter Manuel New but abandoned .
thus about when he made a shot of ide@@ ye about the lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
recently , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola added a quarter with David Al@@ aba in the very close to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , who made it well .
Mario Göt@@ ze , after Com@@ cular problems re@@ back in the pool , sat outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ WC @-@ hero gave a green light only after the final training , he said Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who wants to make something different from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the first change Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an for the evangel@@ ist Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59@@ . ) .
she was very late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6. ) and made it all clear by El@@ f@@ meter for 13 minutes .
before the game it was come to the stadium at Kra@@ v@@ alle .
after a smaller group of sometimes avoided Bayern fans in their viewer &apos;s block evi@@ d@@ ently the trailer of host Pir@@ ate was with words and G@@ esten prov@@ oked , seized the security forces and went up with drums against the Munich trailer .
at least a Bayern @-@ Fan was eliminated from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has higher risk to lose teeth
those who smoke , not only the lung , but also the teeth , this has a Potsdam long @-@ term study close .
good news : when w@@ ished , the risk is reduced quickly .
smo@@ kers have a much higher risk of loos@@ ing their teeth soon .
this emerg@@ es from the long @-@ term study of an international team @-@ teams , including several employees of the German Institute for N@@ utr@@ itional Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smoking smoking , the risk of dying to lose their teeth , around 2.@@ 5- to 3.6 times higher .
the scientists had observed more than 23,@@ 300 participants .
main causes of dental loss shall be c@@ aries and inflamm@@ ation of the g@@ um , emphas@@ ises the DI@@ f@@ E .
for these peri@@ od@@ ont@@ itis , smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ize the authors .
the connection between smoking and dental loss is therefore going to frequent g@@ um disease in smo@@ kers .
smoking not clari@@ fied , as well as smoking is increased the risk of c@@ aries .
people who were qu@@ itting smoking by smoking could reduce the risk in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research &quot; within a short period of time .
it could , however , take over ten years until the end@@ anger@@ ed to the level of non @-@ smoking smoking , stated first writer Thomas Dietrich von der British University of Birmingham .
people must convince men to convince them non @-@ smo@@ kers , the director H@@ einer Boeing of DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking shor@@ tens life time . &quot;
not to smoke is good for lung and j@@ acks and leads to our knowledge too high quality health to high age .
in Germany , over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years are affected by tooth @-@ free , this DI@@ f@@ E granted .
earlier studies should already be noted that smoking is the risk for early tooth failure .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ pin the findings .

the EU Commission proposes new court in dispute over the TT@@ IP
the EU Commission proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system planned over the planned tran@@ sponder free trade agreement in TT@@ IP .
the controversi@@ al private control facilities for disp@@ utes between corpor@@ ations and states are to be replaced by a transparent system , which meets considerably more traditional dishes in its function .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to do a system that trust the citizens &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the responsible EU Com@@ miss@@ ile Cec@@ ilia superior authority declared on the performance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Swe@@ des must first bring the proposal as a European negoti@@ ating position in the free trade talks with the USA . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced support .
the world &apos;s largest free trade zone around the world will arise with 800 million people .
plans in the reform of the current arbit@@ ration procedure see in particular states that the EU countries and the USA are together independent judges to choose a new investment Court .
they are supposed to come from the EU , the US and third @-@ party states .
the second instance is also planned for the first time .
they would allow it to rise up against jud@@ gements .
until now , the case involved in relation to the arbit@@ rator , a bubble fee against their judgments were not admitted .
in the discussion of recent months , clearly stated that citizens did not trust the old IS@@ DS system in terms of fair@@ ness and justice .
in the long term , she plans to work on an International Investment Court in the long term .
for example , the disp@@ utes between Chinese companies and the EU states could be clari@@ fied in the example .
the required investor &apos;s arbit@@ ration procedure ( IS@@ DS ) is considered one of the main reasons for the major resistance in Europe against TT@@ IP .
the traditional arbit@@ rators are critic@@ ized by opponents as a kind of parallel , providing the pollutants de@@ ferred control of the tax@@ pay@@ er , national legislation or decrease in consumption and environmental standards .
in the first comments , anti @-@ TT@@ IP @-@ organisations such as Camp@@ act received the proposals of the EU Commission as in@@ adequate .
in particular , the negoti@@ ated free trade agreement with Canada ( CE@@ TA ) is critic@@ ized for the already negoti@@ ated free trade agreement with Canada ( CE@@ TA ) .
the German Economy State Secretary Matthias F@@ ender ( SPD ) described the plans for a great progress .
the Commission Con@@ sider the reform essential points , the Federal Minister for Foreign Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel in the spring with other EU trade ministers .
the old system of private arbit@@ rators is from the table .
the French government also welcomed its plans .
the European corporate association business Europe war@@ ned that the gap of the economy must comply with many new rules .
especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ closed by the under@@ side .
when discussions can be completed through the free trade agreement TT@@ IP ( Tran@@ sat@@ lan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) , continued un@@ clear on Wednesday .
the negotiations have been run since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the subject of investors has not been discussed with the USA .

he tells of different locations that he will always report on the map in which his mines and tender songs arrange .
where they were created and looks like it looks in his home .
since then Stev@@ ens has since been aston@@ ishing as a wonder@@ fully creative

Jeremy Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s debut with the Prime Minister , Jeremy Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s
Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s has made the debut with voltage by Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s since his election
the new Labour leader Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n is his debut in the Prime Minister David &apos;s debut , and David Cameron came to David Cameron &apos;s first time .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n is set up in order to provide the first of his six pre @-@ defined questions shortly after lunch , with his power from the media most likely to be tested from the close ties .
he called &quot; fewer the@@ aters and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could ski@@ p some sessions to ski@@ p them to colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s leadership , as she comes to his appointment as a member of the Sch@@ atten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett and following his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the Labour Party &apos;s decision on Tuesday during the singing of the National An@@ them at a memorial commemor@@ ating the 7@@ 5th anniversary of Battle of Britain in silence , prov@@ oked by a number of T@@ ory @-@ MP@@ S , and stands at the core of several theme pages @-@ Stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s decided to sing the national an@@ them , has caught attention to itself
he was a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n , he would have stood in resp@@ ect@@ ful silence , &quot; and he recognized the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the air fl@@ ap around England . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s Sch@@ atten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the struggle against the struggle that he had to sing the National An@@ ym@@ n , &quot; independent of its belief that the monarchy should be abolished .
almost a dozen of shade @-@ ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s team , and they are foc@@ uss@@ ed on differences in economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Parliamentary Party supported him as leaders .
the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also reflected in the Labour market , &quot; according to Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s pron@@ oun@@ ds to the European Union and the limit of threads .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n told the TU@@ C Conference , to set the Labour changes to remove the whole idea of a limitation .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow of labour and pen@@ sions , said the party &quot; very clear &quot; that she only said to the government plans to lower the limit of 26@@ ,000 pounds to 23@@ ,000 pounds .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n is the fifth Labour leader , which David Cameron &apos;s Chief Executive Officer , since then he has been named T@@ ory CEO , in the last decade above the patch box in the parliament .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Labour leader , which has promised another policy issues , says that he has been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ row@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ideas for questions to Mr. Cameron and given more than 30.000 suggestions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Is@@ lington North MP has said that the fre@@ unde of the Prime Minister is con@@ front@@ ative and that he will leave out both &quot; impact and the stre@@ it with resistance , and has resolved to focus on serious problems like poverty , ine@@ quality and challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle is represented by Angela Eagle who will not participate in the sh@@ adows business minister when he is not taking part - for example if Mr. Cameron is travelling abroad .
he has also brought the idea to discussion that other colleagues may occasionally take the word , and that he is John Ber@@ re , who spoke speaker of the house , to discuss the problem .
when he was leader in 2005 Mr Cameron said that he would be able to remove from the politics in the style of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le Theatre , &quot; which often is linked with the fre@@ unde of the Prime Minister . but a few years later he dre@@ amed that he had dar@@ ed in it .
since she was first broadcast in 1990 on TV , the fre@@ igh@@ ter was considered the most important Bar@@ ometer of a leader and his leadership within his parliament and his position under his parliamentary parliament , although critics argu@@ ed , they have become a car@@ ic@@ ature and require a major re@@ forms .

between May and July , earnings without bonuses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.9 % over the same period of the same period last year .
this percentage had been the fastest and posted in@@ valuable interest in the time of an interest rate since 2009 .
the pound has risen by more than 1 % compared to the dollar on $ 1.@@ 5@@ 505 and was climbed by 0.@@ 84 % compared to Euro 1.@@ 37@@ 30 .
the F@@ T@@ SE 100 Index closed with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29.@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share on the market and made a jump of 20 % , after assum@@ ing the offer of the ri@@ vals AB in Be@@ v .

the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter C@@ ow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers &quot; could mean more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
but it is in@@ prob@@ able that this purchase power will increase the higher amount of labour costs in his firm , he says .
the costs could meet the expan@@ sion@@ less plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are less additional jobs .

inspired by the pro@@ ver@@ b &quot; potato &quot; in a poster , the pe@@ i@@ da movement has attached Al@@ h@@ ay potato and meat together on a sk@@ ewer .
the idea was brought to a poster depic@@ ting a Peg@@ i@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; Pot@@ atoes &quot; with the tweeter &quot; which he had random@@ ly seen in television .

met@@ cash starts soil detention campaign for combat al@@ di@@ - in@@ fest@@ ation
met@@ cash tries to protect the IG@@ A branch in front of a Al@@ di @-@ march in South Australia and Western Australia .
food distributors - Met@@ cash has launched a base resistance campaign to defend the market share of IG@@ A retail@@ er in South Australia and Western Australia in advance to a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di has prepared the opening of two sales centres and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia in early next year , strengthen met@@ cash and IG@@ A @-@ supermarkets their relationships with local food suppliers and marketing the brand IG@@ A by ma@@ inst@@ re@@ am marketing and marketing on the social media , as well as events such as Adelaide @-@ Show .
Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as E@@ ish@@ manufacturer Simm@@ o out of D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who sold in IG@@ A @-@ shops samples and shop @-@ owner who sell tickets for the South Australian Football League at faithful customers .
the security strategy is expected to take further details of his defense strategy on 29 September , when the whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers for food , alcohol and devices will run out its annual investors .
it is a lot in the game , as South Australia and Western Australia accounts for almost 30 percent of met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A shops and higher profit margin as a Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A network in the Eastern states .
proc@@ urement in South Australia and Western Australia are a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in Western Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to about 14 percent in eastern Australia .
however , an@@ alysts think as Morgan Stanley is that Al@@ di twelve months after opening his first markets , about five percent of the food market in these two states will take away and all existing actuators , but mainly that independent retailers will lead to sales .
a report published this week according to analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stanley published that IG@@ A retail@@ er could lose $ 360 million in turnover each year and to cash $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
the forecast is based on the assum@@ ption that Al@@ di has launched 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA , which is expected to generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
loss in food and food and food quantities at met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed amount may cost about $ 13 million in profit before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , lost cash market shares in the eastern States , mainly on Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan had found that IG@@ A buyers are the first few .
Morgan Stanley particip@@ ates that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s sales in the food and food market fell 3.8 percent in 2016 to 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and a market share of 14 percent in 2015 will be reduced to 10.3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told a business@@ man in Melbourne , that was to disappear within a decade .
Met@@ cash rejected it publicly to react to the comments of Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a member of the board has been contact with Mr Dou@@ glass Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
IG@@ As market share has gone down from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and income from met@@ c@@ ash@@ s foods and food retailers have fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , which reflects the loss of loss of balance on sales and mar@@ gins .
the wholesale distributors , however , will invest more than 150 million $ in order to help selling col@@ es and wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths at hundreds of products every week to improve fresh foods with faster growing fresh food and better choice of private label food .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s main managing director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and load sanctions on Elan are expected and hopes that the wholesale distributors in 2017 will return to a winner growth for the first time in four years .
Than@@ asi Co@@ kin@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Than@@ asi Co@@ kin@@ is deserv@@ es rather praise and cr@@ iti@@ que for his behaviour .
Than@@ asi Co@@ kin@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ateral damages &quot; in the shortest storm around his friend Nick K@@ yr@@ gios and earned to view the chairman of the Australian tennis group , Steve He@@ aly rather praise his own behavior .
co@@ ch@@ ak@@ is , the younger of talented Du@@ os , is known as &quot; special KS &quot; due to the inf@@ am@@ ous con@@ front@@ ation of K@@ yr@@ gios with St@@ an WA@@ W@@ R@@ IN@@ KA at the Montreal Masters in the spotlight .
in a fe@@ aring qualifying match in Cinc@@ inn@@ ati , co@@ ch@@ k@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ry@@ an Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the arbit@@ rator , with Har@@ rison : &quot; WA@@ W@@ R@@ IN@@ KA would have beaten K@@ yr@@ gios and I should beat the child . &quot;
as he was recently seen , as he cr@@ ushed a tennis ra@@ cket , a Kr@@ amp@@ f was defeated a potential US Open @-@ victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ac@@ is was def@@ ended by He@@ aly .
the te@@ ens is currently at Glasgow , in competition with Sam Gr@@ oth in order to win the second place in singles qualifying behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup final round against Britain .
&quot; one thing , on which I was quite anno@@ ying , is the fact that after my view of Than@@ asi there was a little in the battle , &quot; He@@ aly said .
he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost a ra@@ cket in the US Open because he is not the first player who broke the bat of Fr@@ ust together with itself , and I know Than@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he really behavior in the US Open , even under the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances of Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserv@@ ed a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around it , and I think he was treated a little to strictly treated .
he is a very rei@@ ther 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard and it fits into the team and so on , he is never used a problem with the other players he is too hard , it is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserv@@ es it to be judged according to his own services .
He@@ aly did also supported the decision to take account K@@ yr@@ gios at the important preliminary decision , which begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right for all , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ lasting look into the team . &quot;
&quot; first we wish that the team is fully concentrated on the competition and do not all around the contro@@ vers@@ y around &#91; C@@ yr@@ gios &#93; , &quot; He@@ aly said .
and I believe that Nick has made it very fast to rise , for people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray , he will try to under@@ stand@@ able in the eyes of the audience , but we try to try him to clear it . some time outside the lim@@ it@@ ments , in which he can think about it , I think it is best for the team and it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s best for him .
European refugee crisis : Hungary explained Not@@ with@@ standing , closes the border , keeps refugees
Hungary explained the emergency @-@ level and locked the south border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all of them trying to come illeg@@ ally into the country . everything with the aim to stop the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed at the border , while hundreds of migrants arrested themselves in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and revol@@ ted with indig@@ nation .
the people who fled before violence took a stop on the road between the two control points of the country between the two control points of the country and built there .
but fru@@ str@@ ations went up .
as a police helicopter connected over them , the migrants &quot; Open the border ! &quot; and they cried al@@ ert against the Hungarian police policy .
some estimates from protest food and water .
Serbia declared to be &quot; un@@ acceptable &quot; that migrants were sent back to Hungary , while more and more come from Macedonia and Greece .
( Serbia ) wants to be a part of the solution and does not hurt a coll@@ ater@@ al damage .
it is due to take place in the next days talks with Brussels and other countries , &quot; Iv@@ ica D@@ ac@@ ic said in Prague .
the tur@@ bul@@ ences in the Hungarian French border reached a day after the 28 @-@ Nations blo@@ c at a cont@@ est@@ uous meeting in Brussels , which could not agree joint in@@ flow policy .
the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who were to refuge in the shr@@ inking of Italy and Greece . they afflicted their hopes for the next month or until the end of the year - an agreement would be able to increase another 120,000 refugees , including some of Hungary , including some of Hungary .
Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the migration crisis of the continent .
Hungary won &apos;t put its hopes on an bal@@ ust@@ omed action from Brussels or neigh@@ bors .
on Tuesday , a not@@ ebook in two southern regions was given more powers to cope with the crisis , so that they could cut down streets and accelerate their asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Minister of Foreign Affairs , Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ ar@@ to , said that his country has also plan the construction of a bar@@ bed wire along its border to Romania in order to stop the influ@@ x of migrants attemp@@ ting to stop a fence on the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News @-@ Cor@@ respon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison notes at the race , the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia were used .
in recent months , Hungary is divided for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East to an enormous bott@@ len@@ eck and the input point to the European Union .
Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insi@@ sted that most of the coming economic refugees who are searching for a better life , and not war@@ n@@ ants who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly in contra@@ diction to other EU countries , including Germany .
the new laws , which came into force at midnight , will make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high Za@@ uns , leaving the government along the southern border to Serbia , killing higher adher@@ ents for sentenced human tra@@ der .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation caused by the mass immig@@ ration , the Hungarian government declared the emergency state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokes@@ person Z@@ olt@@ an K@@ ov@@ acs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the southern city of Sz@@ eged . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we say it very clear : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the parliament must still agree to the military service , which is expected for the next week , but repor@@ ters from Associated Press have been seen on the border heavy weapons with vehicles and dogs on tag@@ n@@ ados .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country @-@ security consultant for Or@@ ban , said that authorities were 45 people trying to cross the border ; 15 others were already deeper into the country .
they come over by being damaged the fence , they are now inf@@ erior to police custody and accused the overthrow of criminal off@@ ences after the new laws .
authorities are going to quickly repair the fence .
Hungarian officers have also completed two of the seven borders with Serbia , after a train car with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
chaos re@@ located closer to Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians joined a small office in a metal container to handle the data of people and pressed a crowd with a crowd in order to push there .
about 20 succeeded to enter , but thousands stayed outside .
a further group of migrants blocked the most important highway connection between Serbia and Hungary , saying that they would refuse to grant food and water until they are lost to Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s advantage before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey hal@@ ved
former US Foreign Minister Hill@@ ary Clinton continues to keep a double @-@ digit margin in the democratic race around the nom@@ ination at national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders &apos; wins on the ground .
Clinton now has support 47 percent of democratic voters in the election ( 58 percent before ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase of 17 percent ) .
Vice @-@ President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not announced himself to be President of the presidential office , receives assistance by 15 percent of democratic voters .
more than five months before the start of the election , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion can determine which candidates are supported .
but Clin@@ ton supports their election greater than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS @-@ News @-@ survey Clinton has lost a series of demo@@ graphic groups , while S@@ anders posted several gains .
Clinton holds a big advantage in women and moder@@ ates , but these claims are reduced .
their support in the men is significantly reduced , and S@@ anders is back with 5 points .
Clin@@ ton &apos;s benefit with democratic voters under the age of 50 has ch@@ aired , and they are now at the same height .
Clinton has a big advantage over the older voters .
last month , Clinton was ahead of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit margin in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders have a 5 point lead with this group .
about half of the democratic voters of the country &apos;s pres@@ election would say that they would support refugee couples where they were nominated by the party .
a quarter would support them with some preliminary support and further 15 percent would only support them because they are the candidate .
six percent would not support them .
perhaps not surprising that Clin@@ ton &apos;s latest supporters are particularly impressed by her .
the views are bl@@ ended in den@@ sely the those who currently not support Clinton - only about a quarter would insp@@ ire it .
while 48 percent of democratic voters will say that they will support Clinton with enthusiasm , say less Republi@@ can voters think this about their plant cre@@ di@@ ers Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
when Clin@@ ton is asked in an open question , why they want the candidate to find that she is the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the opinion that it is time that a woman is president ( 13 per cent ) and that she is the best candidate to the job ( 10 per cent ) .
Clinton &apos;s support is also mentioned by Bill Clinton ( 9 per cent ) .
dis@@ agreement with the problems and elec@@ tr@@ iti@@ bility are also quoted .
as the vice president calls for the presidential office in the Wa@@ ag@@ les , 57 percent of democratic voters want to see him in the race - though one third believes that he should not do it .
if democratic voters are asked for the election , who would be the second choice for the party , bi@@ ds at the top .
by Clin@@ t An@@ nex@@ es say more than half , that Bi@@ den would have their second choice in front of S@@ anders .
to vote against the demo@@ c@@ turing of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton increases before S@@ anders , of 20 points with bi@@ ds in the race to 30 points without him in the race .
fifty @-@ five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as candidate country with the best chances to win the election ; however , this figure has dropped from 78 per cent last month .
Bi@@ den is by far a second at this measurement , but the percentage that looks at him as the &quot; selected &quot; has risen .
nevertheless , at the question of what is more important at a Candi@@ date , Democratic Vot@@ ers ask questions about the elec@@ torate .
similarly as in the last month , no single demo@@ c@@ candidate or a potential candidate is un@@ acceptable for these voters than in@@ acceptable .
the Democratic candidate or potential candidate provide good results with some important features in the election of their party .
we are looking to Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as hon@@ est and tru@@ st@@ worthy , and equipped with strong exec@@ u@@ ities .
bi@@ ds cuts at the top three candidates in terms of hon@@ esty , Clin@@ ton &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty percent of democratic voters think that Clinton &apos;s hon@@ est and tru@@ st@@ worthy , twice as many say that over S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion of him .
Democratic Vot@@ ers won the pres@@ election in general also Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ ological A@@ ci@@ ological in accordance with their views .
with all these measurements , approximately one quarter of the democratic voters has no opinion of S@@ anders .
there are questions about Hill@@ ary Clinton to use a personal email address and a server during the term as Foreign Minister , most of the Democratic Vot@@ ers are pleased with their explanation of the matter and to say that their opinions has not affect their opinions .
but it is a total of other history in the American public .
half of the Americans now is dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about one @-@ third is satisfied .
the public opinion was in March , shortly after the problem came into light , split .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail contro@@ vers@@ y had no effect on their general reviews from Clinton , though 36 percent said that their opinion has deterior@@ ated .
there are mainly Republi@@ can , more than six of 10 who say that their views are worse than Clinton .
although Clinton &apos;s sel@@ f@@ ist to be hon@@ est@@ ly and tru@@ st@@ worthy , it is still a problem for them under registered voters in total : only 32 percent see them as hon@@ est and tru@@ st@@ worthy , eight percent less than in the last month and 15 points less since May .
62 % of the voters are not liable for hon@@ our@@ able and tru@@ st@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 % of the voters are currently being proud to be hon@@ est and not tru@@ st@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump will give good notes from the lead .
of the six tested candidates , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush list the best of hon@@ esty .
a majority sees S@@ anders rather as hon@@ est , but as with Car@@ son many do not have any opinion of him .
the error ratio for the sample of 351 registered voters during the pres@@ election is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moved back to Donald Tr@@ ump in the nation of about Donald Tr@@ ump
Ben Car@@ son is located in the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times tight behind Donald Tr@@ ump
at the two candidates , half of the voters falls in the new survey , and others lose dramatically .
Republi@@ can voters will continue to support Tr@@ ump in large numbers . the support is growing 23 % in the last C@@ BS @-@ survey , which was carried out before the Fox News debate in the past month , by 27 % in the survey conducted by Tuesday .
but Car@@ son enjoyed the same period from 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son out@@ performed well in demo@@ graphic groups and sur@@ passing those with higher degree of Republi@@ can elec@@ tors .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio @-@ Govern@@ or John Kas@@ i , is beaten with Wis@@ con@@ sins Govern@@ or Scott Walker , who fell to the deep@@ est , and indeed of 10 % support last month at 2 % .
the former Florida @-@ Govern@@ or J@@ eb Bush , the former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ sas Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ad@@ e and Florida @-@ Senator Marco Ru@@ bio , there are 6 % on third place .
the error margin in the sample of 376 persons of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was carried out in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , which was released last week , shows that Car@@ son falls into the poll@@ s - it begins with 19 % support during Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , drop@@ ping behind Tr@@ ump with 32 % support .
the latest survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tr@@ ump clearly before Car@@ son .
with a look at the past week , Tr@@ ump found some side short@@ th@@ iev@@ es for the former neu@@ rolo@@ gi@@ sts , even after Car@@ son strug@@ gled to ask for himself .
&quot; we need energy , &quot; Tr@@ ump was said last Saturday during a campaign performance in I@@ owa .

five members of the Brotherhood have been deb@@ ated with the death of an Baruch Standard Ne@@ ul@@ ls
almost two years after a student in sm@@ ol@@ oc@@ ous rit@@ u@@ als of a student connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , passed away with a murder of five people .
members of the New York mouth College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ bro@@ se captured Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during a launch rit@@ u@@ als in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , which has contributed to his death , the police shared with his death .
civil servants said that he had been loaded with connected eyes with a 30 @-@ pound back@@ pack and was repeated attacks while he was trying to go over a frozen field on an aim .
Mr. Den@@ g finally lay on head@@ ache , then he fell completely un@@ conscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood rejected not the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was strong and waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police attacked .
however , they had the time to conf@@ use D@@ eng@@ s clothing , his symptoms in goo@@ d@@ les and Andy Men@@ g , to contact the national President of the Brotherhood to give advice , he said &quot; Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on this point the members of U@@ ten@@ sil@@ ia started to hide and set the bro@@ therhood of bro@@ therhood between &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could not revi@@ ved , and he died on his injuries in the next morning .
according to a aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g repeatedly were repeatedly rec@@ ted with bl@@ amed force of injury to head , tor@@ so and upper th@@ igh@@ s .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the shr@@ ans of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies in 1970 every year in the ch@@ ic@@ ans , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer , D@@ eng@@ s family , in a statement .
Bru@@ der@@ ships and their members must be drawn to account and this step by authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury of Monroe received an acc@@ us@@ ation for Mor@@ ning &apos;s third place for the first five members .
two and thirty members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of dangerous attacks and formation of a criminal act .
&quot; we do not only want to represent the involved persons responsible , but if there is an organization that has been officially or un@@ officially - these sanctions , we will also draw those on account , &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday .
the Brotherhood College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national bro@@ therhood has passed its affili@@ ation to the city group .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest
an interest rate is coming , and the property is getting caught , R@@ end@@ ums for bonds are rising , and the economy will lead into recession .
we do know this .
what we don &apos;t know how long will it take and how long will it stop .
in particular , the history for the economy offers a small guide to the exp@@ iry of the program .
a recession came within only 11 months after the first interest rate hike and lasted for 86 months .
the aggressi@@ vity of the Federal Reserve at the rate of interest rates is often if there is not always a factor , such as the economy and financial investments respond .
hence , representative of the U.S. Central Bank thus rati@@ fies that investors should not focus on their interest , but rather to increase the rates of interest , but rather to the period which is required for norm@@ alization .
in fact , several variables are playing a roll .
at the end , market participants anticip@@ ate that all the fur@@ cation could possibly ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated because of a rate of interest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will be interpreted as a signal for the end of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recommen@@ ding joint &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Julian J@@ ess@@ op , Chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication of customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradu@@ al return of US interest to normal heights , but still too low level to lead the seism@@ ic shock that seem to fear many .
this does not mean that there will be no effect .
here is a look at historical trends based on how some areas of the economy could respond to :
as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest @-@ increases things could be vol@@ ati@@ l for a while .
as soon as the increase occurs , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is apparently a tendency to dev@@ ote 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps again refle@@ cting the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank an@@ alysts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a recent study what happened to Z@@ ins@@ Chart of the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more precisely , the market is usually in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to the interest rate , quite flat in the 250 days after a recent analysis after 500 days , with an average yield in the past six times of 14.4 percent according to a current analysis , the Bob D@@ oll , chief system Strat@@ os at Nu@@ ve@@ en asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s asset Management .
the Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares ten@@ ds to occur later in the increases cycle , and the yield thus begins to decrease .
recipes are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is con@@ fron@@ ted with some conditions that there was not before and thus spe@@ eded a recession .
extremely remarkable is that the gross domestic product will be in the proximity of its lowest point at an interest rate of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , 118 percent of interest rate has only been nominal to the nominal GDP below 4.5 percent since 1950 .
even though the second quarter of 2015 stood at 3.6 percent , only few that will last the last quarter and expect exports to Atlanta F@@ ed at only 1.5 percent .
interest increases in such frag@@ ile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and cast the question as if it is that time , &quot; the Deutsche Bank said .
market participants have made the whole year to a premium increase of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were aimed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC could achieve an increase in this meeting , the fut@@ ures trade is only a probability of 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during our study , all the time cycles of 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing moment@@ um during the GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ ession@@ ist very quickly after the start of recovery , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clear recovery of what the worst recession in the observed phase was .
the current cycle is by far the longest , which the F@@ ed has maintained since the end of the last recession , the record was 35 months , and this has been up to 74 months .
the fixed income was also vol@@ ati@@ l because the market is anticip@@ ating a rate of interest rate , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect of bonds faster than in stock if they change their strategic course .
with bonds , the R@@ end@@ ums seem to change the direction once the initial increase / lowering is carried out in the cycle .
at the end of the increases cycle , the latter cycle fall off immediately , the Deutsche Bank said .
the strateg@@ ists by Charles Sw@@ ab believes that the increase in interest rates will lead to close loans between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a breakdown of the curve .
high @-@ interest bonds often bring better earnings in such a climate , although &quot; we are still c@@ auti@@ ous to expect higher yields , &quot; Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come an@@ alysts in Schw@@ ab , in a analysis .
what is interesting , Jones that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides the strength of the dollar and the decline of the inflation expectations , there are some evidence that the market has adapted to the scope of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest has risen , the applic@@ ant has risen , lending , lending , and the volume level has increased - all characteristics of the market if the F@@ ed has tigh@@ tened their strategy .
in the big and whole , companies that wrap into the larger part of their business activities in the USA will benefit if interest rates rise and local products attractive .
multin@@ ational corpor@@ ations with high debt shall be worse , as a rising dollar raised their products on the global market and as well as financing its debts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; items tend to respond more positive after an initial interest rate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sachs an@@ alysts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
firms with strong balance sheet , companies have exceeded by 5 percentage points after each of the interest rate increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital yields and low volume levels in their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts are a great problem .
companies with a high share of flexible interest will lose the most , Gold@@ man said .
consumers also benefit from increasing costs outside the pure share of shares .
as@@ par@@ agus may see gains due to higher yields , even if experts think to take place in different opinion , as quickly as possible .
BBC Radio 3 is a replica of the Classic FM , says the parliament of Andrew B@@ ingham
the Con@@ fir@@ med of Parliament critic@@ ised the transmitter for his &quot; slan@@ ting &quot;
he argu@@ ed that he is not to distingu@@ ish more from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also wrote to the BBC Music Awards and said that they just published The Br@@ its
parliament @-@ Colle@@ ge Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins also attacked the programme The Voice , and said that this was not very original .
BBC Radio 3 : &quot; converted &quot; to Classic FM , asser@@ ts a leader and raises new pressure on the transmitter , to prove that he does something that does not do the broad@@ c@@ aster .
the Con@@ sole Members of Andrew B@@ ingham also said to the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen , that the publicly @-@ legal radio broad@@ casts had &quot; stup@@ id , &quot; and increasingly no longer be able to disc@@ ern any more of its commercial competitors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I &apos;m using the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stup@@ id &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but it seems to transform itself to Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also contributed to the BBC Music Awards , which started in the last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started in last year , appear to be The Br@@ its just under another name .
so if you are trying to do something else - these are two spont@@ aneous examples of which you actually are on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham .
BBC Director General also proved the alleg@@ ations and argu@@ ed that BBC Radio 3 went far from its commercial compet@@ itor , when it comes to public music and re@@ conn@@ aissance of the public .
what I learn about Radio 3 I &apos;ll learn about classical music somewhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that really is uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 , to find new music and put new works in order , I am really important for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey reported that har@@ der had to work to eng@@ age the audience than it did so in the past , because the British had not been informed about classical music .
at Radio 3 , however , radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC manufacturing , which during the hearing in the committee on the choice of culture , media and sport , on fire , to initi@@ ate any commercial ri@@ vals on its feet .
the T@@ ory member Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins @-@ handle The Voice to - the musical talent show of the BBC , which was acquired by the Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discuss@@ ing because it is not original and not especially mark@@ edly ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show - with the Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced in a special BBC manner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added , he wishes to find that the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can find a hit from our company in the company , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it is the next time star@@ red . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to exclu@@ de the order of further orders of The Voice in the Future or to give money of the t@@ oo@@ thing for other entertainment formats .
Internet sales rose in August at the slow@@ est and the Black Friday can be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 there were seven percent increase in online sales .
in the last month , the lowest result was recorded in 2000 .
online sales intensi@@ fied three years ago by using mobile phones to buy
experts believe that the Black Friday has slow@@ ed out in November
for more than a decade the virtual shopping has to be drilled , and many of the main shopping streets in Great Britain was transformed into mind @-@ ma@@ ids .
but experts predi@@ ct that there are now call@@ sign that the online sales are stag@@ n@@ ating after new numbers exhibited only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August showed the lowest increase in growth since the start of recorded in 2000 with only five percent increase from the previous year .
experts predi@@ ct that there are indications that online sales are stag@@ n@@ ating after new numbers only showed a seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you consider the growth rates for previous years and will go back by 2000 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in the course of time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ RG sale complex from the Guardian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he declared that the online sales were over three years ago , when buyers began to work with their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do it in different environments , such as home on the sofa .
but now that one comm@@ utes itself , and we will see that the growth decreases .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon , imported from America , is cited as a reason for trading income .
experts believe that buyers will keep their purchases at this event , which will take place last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers got around their computers to make their bar@@ gain , and a number of dealer websites over@@ threw .
experts believe that black Friday , at which the buyer was fought for mu@@ ff@@ ing attacks , buyers could hold something that could be taken for purchases .
a study by the British Ret@@ ail Con@@ sortium found that £ 5 spending a little over £ 1 was issued online .
in some products such as television and washing machines are carried out over a third of purchases on web @-@ shops .
at the same time , more than one quarter of the people are buying clothing and shoes online instead of the clusters in the cities .

B &amp; Q Boss says that at the time of the budget from Eastern European people is over
Brit@@ ons increasingly des@@ people , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of qualified people from Eastern Europe has rise to
this leads to the fact that 200 other Scre@@ w@@ ets stores which are aimed at tra@@ des@@ people
simultaneously connecting the King@@ F@@ isher 60 B &amp; Q outlets at the same time
from Ru@@ pert Steiner , City Chef @-@ Cor@@ respon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is alleged that Britain will lay their hamm@@ ers and brush in favour of the use of qualified e@@ European tools that carry out the work in their home .
when you get sk@@ ill@@ ful with a hammer or a brush for feeding walls , you belong to a minority nowadays .
the British will increasingly employ workers to conduct home jobs in their houses , the head of the company behind B &amp; Q .
V@@ é@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new Managing Director of King@@ F@@ isher , who owns the tree @-@ growing chain , said that a large increase in number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe said that provide services to low prices , has meanwhile been overhau@@ led .
therefore King@@ F@@ isher is planning to open 200 more screens to open tra@@ des@@ people and include 60 sales outlets of B &amp; Q .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , since eight of ten buying decisions in the store are taken by women .
at the moment the men weigh the men .
it said that it is necessary to make the growing demo@@ graphic trends that have more female single homes than do more renov@@ ations than in the past .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; there is still a majority of men in our branch .
we need to move it stronger to a balance .
in general , half of our customers are made up of women with 80 percent of the decisions regarding the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in decision @-@ making process .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the top of a British in the F@@ T@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also completed their top team to reflect the same number of women and women in man@@ ag@@ erial positions .
King@@ F@@ isher is almost the only enterprise that has occupied just over 50 percent of the team including the management and Chief Financial Officer .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was an important decision - this is an important topic .
it was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board .
King@@ F@@ isher with@@ ered a decline in the semi @-@ annual profit and the rates , after the group raises the costs for the closing of the shops .
because of the trends , King@@ F@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches .
officials of A@@ I / DO@@ B because of initial court
on Wednesday two officials of the Austrian volleyball @-@ Viz@@ or A@@ I / DO@@ B have to answer for lack of diso@@ be@@ dience and Re@@ conc@@ iliation on Wednesday .
the accused are not guilty .
one of these was also indicted for municipal abuse .
he was acquitted of this alleg@@ ations in May of convic@@ tion .
the current process was post@@ pon@@ ed .
according to the General At@@ tor@@ ney Robert Ri@@ ffel , he was found in the preliminary investigation , that the accused could disp@@ oss@@ essed from the years 2006 to 2011 , about whom they had disp@@ ers@@ ed in their functions , used for private purposes .
in doing this , it will suffer about 400,000 euros .
the sports functional are also charged because of financial institutions .
this fact was the chairman of the bill , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ im , from this fact .
it should be negoti@@ ated at a later date .
the evidence of the un@@ faith@@ fulness laid out in defense that the association was not a time part of an asset .
the sports func@@ tioned only for allowance , and the Sport@@ club , for whom they had been active from 1982 to 2011 and has spent some 600,000 pounds ( about 44@@ ,000 euros ) in 2001 to have spent some time and money in the liabilities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then we stood before the situation : let &apos;s go further or un@@ locking the club ? &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; one of the def@@ endants , in the bread @-@ based statutory auditor of the financial market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then he decided to do this task with his colleagues and co @-@ accused .
with all risks .
&quot; we have shot up money to put away our life insurance as security at the Bank , &quot; he said within the capture .
with the association it has been agreed : you can easily manage the money , but not only any debts are made .
furthermore , during the corresponding financial - success the payout of allowance was decided until 1991 .
therefore , one part of the allowance was only introduced years later , namely , from 2003 , when a plus on the account has been paid out .
therefore , l@@ ump sum and not detailed remarks , the former Ob@@ man explained the operations .
the accounts and tr@@ au@@ ctions captured the two accused together , said the second def@@ endants .
why the pay@@ outs have not been opened in detail in detail , the judge asked .
the society has not been interested in detail in the financial statements , important for the association &apos;s freedom , the answer .
in 2011 , against the one func@@ tionary investigation , an amount of 120,000 EUR was transferred to the bank account .
these were failed , the accused appe@@ aled .
this securities account for the name of the second accused and was not known as according to the organization .
&quot; why ? &quot; I want to know the judge .
this asked how long did not ask .
then he thought that he would have believed that this was the best for the association .
if something happened to him , nobody would have known something of that money , the prosec@@ utor put in the room .
the co @-@ def@@ endants had been informed and justi@@ fy the function .
this transfer was formulated as &quot; claims rest@@ itu@@ tion &quot; .
why compensation regarding ? , wanted to know the judge and attor@@ ney .
this def@@ endant declared the first def@@ endant , he was not understood with this formulation , since the association has never been any damage .
but what shall I do when the lawyer says , &quot; You are all of you from the tail@@ or . &quot;
&quot; am I a Legal Represent@@ atives ? &quot; he asked .
he said the functional thing , he has never obtained a cent salary , he has only left o@@ dom@@ eter allowance and di@@ ets .

time of Decision about interest rates for the US @-@ banknote
the world is observed when the U.S. dollar bank is taken on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday to meet the important decision , whether for the first time ever since almost a decade the interest is raised or not .
a survey conducted below 80 econom@@ ists , taken by Reuters , found that a little more than half , which was still last week of view , that the F@@ ed will do this , now think that the F@@ ed will continue to keep the interest rates at the present level of 0 @-@ 0.25 per cent .
it is a historic event because it has been around seven years since the F@@ ed Inter@@ est was on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time we approach a situation in which a large Central Bank probably leaves the zero area and initi@@ ates a process of norm@@ alization of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bide , Head of Chief Executive Officer at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the U.S. economy is based on a relatively good performance level , trillion dollars will be added to the balance and generate just a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the fewer raw views of global conditions .
she war@@ ned the markets to reach an increase , but indicate the signs indicate that the od@@ ds towards such a step is well .
the decision should be announced at 20.00 CET on Thursday
cont@@ ru@@ ction at the Delta State University left post@@ ing compensation
after the shooting and killing of his gir@@ l@@ friend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he shot his colleague a note that he wrote him &quot; sorry &quot; with the first murder and wanted to make it happen , &quot; he could not make it happen , &quot; stated authorities on Tuesday .
the police in G@@ Au@@ er , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , lecturer for Ge@@ ography and Social Sciences at the Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning called
and he said , He shot down on a man , and someone put to death .
Lamb told the staff of the emergency department , that the police have to send police officers to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I created my wife last night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also mentioned that a &quot; sweet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house but he will not distur@@ b one &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but probably more excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the call@@ ers after his name , but he did not take him .
Lamb has no explanation for his shots .
when the police entered the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ ent@@ iss , 41 , and a handwritten note from Lamb , 45 , the said , &quot; I &apos;m sorry that I wanted to do it .
I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman who loved me . &quot;
after writing the note record about 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor for history , killing his own life on Monday night when polic@@ emen trained him to destroy him .
the President William La@@ For@@ ge said , he was ignor@@ ant of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was a little Mr Lam@@ od presentation . &quot;
in spite of reports on Monday , which thought , he too had a relationship with Schmidt , said authorities on Tuesday , there is no evidence whatsoever &quot; no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot;
Pr@@ un@@ iss was described by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said that she was married about seven years as a &quot; good human being &quot; described .
the two were di@@ vor@@ ced 15 years ago , but stayed friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , he and Pr@@ astonished had a daughter who is 19 , and she was destroyed &quot; on the ground . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ un@@ iss were her daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
Pr@@ un@@ iss has worked online from home , according to Lin@@ s@@ day Know@@ les , which was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ ent@@ iss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ ent@@ iss , who had a dog called Light@@ ning , had been working with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; she wanted to help other people , &quot; Know@@ les Know@@ les
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said , Lamb is called by a certain time on Monday to tell them &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he doesn &apos;t go to prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police officers caught him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville in that night , drove his car to the side , fled on foot , ran in the forest and killed himself with a shot .
in spring 2015 he received a PhD from the Delta State University , as his le@@ aning on the university &apos;s website .

Eu@@ ros@@ ings : Lufthansa is building the Group around
the Lufthansa is planning a large group of restructuring .
as a result , the Lufthansa Group will save a half billion euros per year alone with a better organization .

Lufthansa will build up its corporate structure and uses the cheap Eu@@ ros@@ ings .
the aim of real@@ ignment is a contribution to a profit contribution of some 500 million euros a year , which accounts for the airline on Wednesday .
among other things , Lufthansa will not have more information on the passenger business in the future .
the costs of the Eu@@ ros@@ ci@@ ings should be as independent as possible .
in the Executive Board , CEO Carsten Sp@@ oh@@ r , Mr. Carsten Sp@@ oh@@ r , will be responsible for Eu@@ row@@ ings in the future .
with the re @-@ order we under@@ lines Sp@@ oh@@ r the importance of Eu@@ row@@ ings , with which the Group plans to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet .
to date , the organization of the 120 000 employees was complex .
the airline operates under the airline &apos;s roof , three quarters of its annual turnover of € 30 billion .

Manchester Sha@@ w by Manchester United can &apos;t play monthly due to double action
hat@@ ch Luke Sha@@ w suffered from the Champions League @-@ defeat in Manchester at the PS@@ V Eindhoven . double the structure of his right B@@ one .
while this is the left def@@ ending to weeping and close him for at least six months of playing , Louis van G@@ aal does not give the hope that Sha@@ w can play back in this season .
the injury was caused by a guided attack by H@@ é@@ ctor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year @-@ old Sha@@ w was broken into the PS@@ V range .
he was treated for nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before being brought into hospital .
van G@@ aal sum@@ med up a double leg and is located in the hospital . &quot;
tomorrow or maybe a day later was re@@ located and then in Manchester had surgery .
it &apos;s aw@@ ful - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United which makes it very difficult and then really playing , and then it happens .
in the dressing cabin he had a oxygen @-@ mask .
he wept .
I am no doctor , but if you have a double action , then takes the six month , and it will not play in the group phase .
I hope that he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to be a red card and the suspension of a bit of a hole .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbit@@ rator , has not pen@@ alised the Mexican driver .
van G@@ aal assumed that the Italian refer@@ ee had wrong .
you can test for yourself , if I say that a capacitor and a red card are sus@@ cep@@ tible to yourself .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
a twe@@ et for Sha@@ ws account : &quot; thank you all for your messages . words not describe , as broken me , my way to the recovery starts now , I come back again . &quot;
untreated : Manchester United suff@@ ers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w at the defeat at PS@@ V
the British defender of France has an additional incenti@@ ve to recover from the European Championship in France until the coming of June .
Philli@@ p Coc@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot;
if a player leaves this type from injury to the place , all are very sad about that .
it is never the intention of our players to viol@@ ate a opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg press in Mexico against Van Ga@@ as Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he makes himself very hard because it was not his intention to viol@@ ate the enemy , and if you hear it is a bad injury , isn &apos;t it good &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Coc@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not possible to see the moment for me .
the only thing I could see was the ball , which was in another direction , so that it looked as if he had touched him &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; , but I could not see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno : &quot; I know how that feels it , I know how difficult it can be .
I feel very bad . I &apos;m sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to the hospital - after a collection of Chris Sm@@ alling .
certainly , David Cameron &apos;s Lor@@ ax does better ?
it &apos;s a matter to learn all parents : if your child loves a book , it will not take long until you know it almost all .
unless you are , you &apos;re perhaps David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child@@ care systems , his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens , chose the Prime Minister of The Lor@@ ax , which was published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult election , Cameron wrote in a message on the website of the company super@@ camps , and continues : &quot; fun , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book I like to give my children , because it seems always a picture or message that we have missed . &quot;
everything nice and good , except that the subsequent paragraph , in which Cameron supp@@ os@@ edly describes the action of the book , re@@ plen@@ ished a syn@@ op@@ sis of the film version from 2012 , giving new characters and details to extend the rather short original text to original text .
&quot; nestled amongst the imm@@ ac@@ ed city Th@@ need Ville , where all the nature is gone and even the air has been a commod@@ ity , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , whose wish was to see a real tree , was read , &quot; writes . a love experience was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name Theodor Se@@ uss Geis@@ el was born and who died in 1991 , but completely unknown .
as if not yet ir@@ oned enough , the text reads that by Cameron stands today as the summary of the Lor@@ ax film that is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database , where everything is artificial and even the air has a product , hopes a boy called Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y to win the girl of his dreams . &quot;
though he is engaged to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems un@@ likely that Cameron stands the action of the book as little . here , an un@@ named boy , like the local environment through the base of the name Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ck@@ ish , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous creature , &quot; is rav@@ aged in the name of trees . &quot;
most likely , such a relatively low PR client has been assigned to a lower part , which the Lor@@ ax has not read 20 times in a row .
one Dow@@ ning Street spokes@@ person said that the text probably has come by the Camer@@ ons office .
super@@ camps confirmed that the Camer@@ ons &apos; text was delivered , but there were no further immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ o was definitely threatened by the expul@@ sion of England , but it is still difficult ...
to meet Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , it is a difficult task , but when you choose the K@@ ader , the UK for the tour , a repet@@ ition of the 3 @-@ 0 test runs does not appear on my card .
I would not end a down@@ ward win .
Al@@ ast@@ air C@@ ooks page is possibly less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin players in Batt@@ ing preparation , and the common is strong ; they will bear no sc@@ ars from 2012 , only a young spin @-@ positive attitude .
with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali was developed as a spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and A@@ DI@@ L Ras@@ hid , even if it represents an unknown size on test level , an option for the attack .
this message : Adam Ly@@ ons leave out of the England @-@ Test @-@ K@@ ader and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to allow Adam Ly@@ th , is of course for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , to analyse .
with its seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard @-@ reality is that thr@@ ill@@ ers are al@@ igned to results .
there was no question mark with Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said these things - players are their own best sel@@ ector .
long ago , the run of Ly@@ th would have been extended , but he had control of his own fate .
if he hop@@ efully further kno@@ bs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , a further chance occurs .
the England @-@ trainer Tre@@ vor Bavarian wor@@ sen@@ ed his attitude , even though he didn &apos;t handle so good performance , and surprised me not ; it is especially a team man .
the question of how much time a test b@@ ail gets to place his character is difficult .
ly@@ th won seven chances of winning like Sam Rob@@ son , while Nick Comp@@ ton received nine .
only Comp@@ ton got a chance for home and back@@ ward playing .
the only throwing that can be raised that England began to wake up in the Caribbean - when Ly@@ th was in peak - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in , and it is a b@@ ats@@ man I guess .
he is an X @-@ factor Cri@@ cket player found in Yor@@ k@@ shire for early season when he scored 236 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which hit us very much .
he must have at least the same od@@ ds as those received before him , but this depends on naturally the United Arab Emirates on the United Arab Emirates .
the idea , Mo@@ een by Cook suggest that an extra spin @-@ Bow@@ ler would bring and see four ch@@ icks , and I don &apos;t have anything against it .
I do not see why a b@@ ats@@ man can &apos;t beat there , and this left hand has already shown that he is an Teu@@ fel@@ sk@@ er@@ l of cri@@ cket players .
Mo@@ een perhaps did not do his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for them , and there is no big difference .
my former team @-@ mate Just@@ in Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he joined the operator in 2001 .
he immediately made three hundred rust immediately and looked back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes in the K@@ ader as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited form he has impressed me as a young man .
people may see his statistics on an average 31 with the ra@@ cket and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a p@@ unt , but there is no big number of backup sp@@ inning , who lift up their hands and the trainer have chosen for youth .
it will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the crew , England has made a few wise additions to the train@@ ee .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ es , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as an advisor for trial games could be a master coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys of the game who will bring an abundance of experience because he played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes in for the white sphere of the Tour and brings energy and powerful use in setup .
I always felt that he created for the international Cri@@ cket Competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has views from which we can profit .
sometimes new voices can be fresh in the dressing cabins , even if the news are talking with the previously referred .
coll@@ ys Team@@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used at the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with this .
some will not agree , but co@@ aches and team controllers are not able to determine the schedule .
and you must remember that as with the players will depend on their jobs at the results .
these decisions are not made easy .
Bre@@ x@@ it &apos;s Camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = Out@@ standing UK &apos;s Britain ) could recover ad@@ mis@@ ing , if the economy until 2017 has been in a shel@@ tered drive
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ exp@@ iring new case strategy to keep the UK in the EU shall come down with each day lower in trouble with each day even without the choice of brilliant Jeremy . &quot; it is &quot; Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n &quot; is the leader of the TU@@ C leaders , viol@@ ating Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at showed that some member states that are deeply stir@@ red in various cris@@ es such as the EU is now and not always from their own debt , Great Britain , and dis@@ rup@@ tive changes , which they do not want to be satisfied .
in Brigh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that they don &apos;t like it to end@@ anger the social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie Agenda .
Prime Minister and Minister of Finance on summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capital cities , make a photo of herself in front of a famous local monument , with or without Local sizes , come home and say that they get allies for re@@ forms .
it always goes round about me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my European friend who wishes to the outside of the EU @-@ Zel@@ da - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s not leave us alone with France , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Berlin - and can see that more and more short @-@ reaching minister and officials from some major cities to the point came to which it doesn &apos;t matter whether we remain or going . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany &apos;s c@@ auti@@ ous Chancellor Angela Merkel is a allies , but she wants to leave the office for 10 years before it looks bad@@ ly for she looks like the ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated long endurance like Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
French François Hollande can look at his re @-@ election or his replacement in 2017 .
he is also a p@@ lowing effect .
Poland must soon see a national@@ ist reform government , a left hand in Spain .
it &apos;s hard to imagine that they could get a bite to help the self @-@ f@@ ath@@ ering , whose energy should be used to prevent the energy from UK - something that they don &apos;t want to do because most similar separ@@ at@@ ist tenden@@ cies are .
hence , some such minister even cannot represent helpful remarks , entirely in the SN@@ P style , while Grand &apos;s speech is in 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , believes my boy@@ friend .
&quot; the trial was a Ple@@ a &quot; and &quot; Great Britain has not gained from the trial . &quot;
Europeans know how rob@@ ber@@ y the Fle@@ et Street may be on its costs and which EU sk@@ ep@@ tics is the press bar@@ one of the press bar@@ one , as they did not have it during the 1975 Tony Ben@@ n , which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
you can remember at Boris Johnson , the ore @-@ Euro @-@ Op@@ portun@@ ities who made a name to a &quot; EU @-@ Straight ban@@ anas in Brussels @-@ correspon@@ dent for the early 90 &quot; s .
at all its fail@@ ures Ed Mil@@ i@@ band knew who had his enemies .
the Med@@ ley was part of the tax relief engra@@ v@@ ings , telephone @-@ h@@ ack@@ ing foreigners , and the pseud@@ o non @-@ cat@@ ers , who own the majority of our large newspapers .
actually Tony Bl@@ air had like them but noted that , if one sits with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , one gets better ban@@ anas to give him up , instead of his lunch and dinner .
indeed , Mil@@ i@@ band was more Bl@@ ai@@ ri@@ ans as Bl@@ air itself , when he had opposed the principle of Camer@@ ons , for Bl@@ air had turned the principle of the constitution of the EU , which was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which led to him a back@@ door .
the press has never been able to draw .
but the nice Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly cl@@ aps on the back on Monday in Westminster . I told him that he didn &apos;t need time to rep@@ ay me any more time in danger , Neil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cot@@ ted Mur@@ der &apos;s strategy of the 80 @-@ ies , a mistake at that time and today .
it may take , but it must develop a coh@@ er@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC sofa has left on Sunday .
Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s &apos;s official position to Europe is - I do not press it - in development .
he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps are traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ ye tendency and wild ge@@ ons from Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ English can probably say Yes .
it &apos;s what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n in the radio and on TV this week , when the boy sc@@ outs were fighting it , not ad@@ mit that Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s became a bad idea that prov@@ oked John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell became a bad idea .
it remin@@ ded me of the seventy @-@ s , when his old father strug@@ gling on television to his Labour @-@ Cab@@ inet to go without losing his cabin and to lose his cabin job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys fight was even more attractive .
but to fight to &quot; under any circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ s expressed - was not that what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell told his fellow members and representatives after all reports on Monday evening on Monday evening .
whatever the s@@ ling Bott@@ om @-@ Up image from Cor@@ by@@ es will be thinking - think that he even touched me - News discipl@@ ines remain important at the age of TV around the clock and especially in the Stru@@ del of the Social Media , a breeding place of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
it &apos;s right to give Cameron no free ticket to Europe which allows him to keep lab@@ ours support in the speech campaign for a self @-@ intelli@@ gi@@ bility how Mc@@ Donn@@ ell it said .
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins don &apos;t think so .
but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s fundamental am@@ big@@ u@@ ities on EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite @-@ riding @-@ economy , of its anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer a question of es@@ ot@@ er@@ ischer discussion at his left dis@@ sidents , for which the Nar@@ c@@ is@@ sm@@ us of little f@@ uss is a central principle of dog@@ matic dispute .
as with its am@@ big@@ u@@ ities on Nato or Tom Wat@@ son , convinced that J@@ C will not be a campaign to the Australia - Foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find in all a sense of their su@@ peri@@ ors .
why should Paris or Berlin apply political delegates , - they also have mis@@ used voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British , if this could be point@@ less ?
the US had already been disappointed with the weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was rec@@ alled by the British Influ@@ ence Security Forum on Monday .
experts critic@@ ise the report by Public Health England on E @-@ cigarettes
alleg@@ ations of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigarettes less harmful are derived from a meeting of 12 persons , partly with connections to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , in the Lanc@@ et , agreed to crit@@ ici@@ ze the post by public Health ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigarettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basic report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last month and describes it as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yet some researchers have put the power rating of the data and referred to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
an editorial in the medical journal of the last month , the &quot; exceptionally win@@ dy foundation , &quot; which he founded his most important conclusion on the road@@ side .
&quot; &quot; &quot; two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked whether the asser@@ tions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on stone or sand &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are being asked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene , and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epi@@ de@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies are based on the detection of efficacy . &quot;
they said that the public opinion is expected that &quot; the current best estimate is that there are about 95 % less harmful in detailed review of evidence and modelling work .
in fact , this statement consists of a single session of 12 people who were called to develop a model for multi @-@ criteria assessment ( Multi @-@ Crit@@ eria Decision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to conduct their opinions on the damages of various nic@@ ot@@ ine @-@ containing products ; the findings of the meeting were merged in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director was previously received by British American Tob@@ acco ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also wrote the references of BA@@ T for public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants in the meeting declared to get an average of an e @-@ cigarettes producers , but did not get the financing which he report@@ edly received after reports from the tobacco company Philip Morris International .
the reasons for selecting the committee shall not be delivered , but also includes several well @-@ known E @-@ cigarettes champion , some of which include some economic financing in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
the tobacco leadership of the P@@ he took part at the meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence for the damages of most products in the majority of criteria &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however there will not be any of these connections or restrictions in the P@@ he report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are no evidence that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are no evidence that E @-@ cigarettes as a road to smoking for kids or non @-@ smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , director of health and well@@ being at P@@ he said that the BM@@ J &apos;s claim had already been re@@ acted before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E @-@ cigarettes are much less harmful as smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life cat@@ cher dies at his su@@ e .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of E @-@ cigarettes in comparison may be small , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects .
P@@ he has the unique duty to report to the public about what evidence is confirmed and not , especially when there is much confusion about rel@@ ative d@@ angers compared to tobacco .
nearly 80,000 people die annually in a disease with respect to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health Care System EUR two billion per year .
in order to clear evidence of current evidence that E @-@ cigarettes is no risk but only a fra@@ ction of the loss created by smoking by smoking , we comply with our national competence .
BBC Should Util@@ ize East@@ en@@ ders , says ex @-@ Chief of Channel 4
the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC should stop to send programs like East@@ en@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ val &quot; would give her right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the radio broadcast only should be used to make the kind of programs not broadcast by other UK channels .
it critic@@ ized the BBC that they publicly chose publicly @-@ legal programs to place the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and transmitters with the popular shows of their ri@@ vals and broadcasting stations such as BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC Director General , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson reported that he had tried for six years in his time at Channel 4 without success with the BBC in touch .
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are displayed on behalf of the BBC , which also clearly showed un@@ conventional Ri@@ vals , &quot; Johnson said the commander @-@ house communications committee in the framework of his research on the future of the BBC .
if you want to keep the radio broadcast , what I do in middle or long for a good idea , you should consider its production at least on programs , the other not doing or commissioned .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class window , because they want to reach a possible support for their future .
the idea that nobody would show this is a joke , it is ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous , of course , is non@@ sense .
Johnson said : &quot; I do not see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax programs financed even without subsi@@ dies could be financed .
the Voice is a further program , East@@ en@@ ders , another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own production .
hon@@ est@@ ly , other channels would give their right arm .
I ende@@ av@@ oured to see how this is supposed to be a public television .
I don &apos;t think that this would reduce the BBC even at all .
Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , the Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 led , said that the BBC level has been on the hunt for reviews , &quot; because of the amb@@ itions of people who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long term support . &quot;
his comments on the most popular ship@@ ments of BBC will give the again what the former leaders of Sky , Tony Ball , presented in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows how East@@ en@@ ders should sell .
Johnson said that the more publicly @-@ legal N@@ ical programs &quot; could go to the BB@@ C4 , but they will be able to accompl@@ ish their duties , and they can ar@@ gue that , &quot; of course , we have created all this ob@@ sc@@ iss@@ ors programs that nobody has seen . &quot;
they put them into a time window where nobody wanted to see them .
in the broadcast cost Johnson to the Committee : &quot; I encourage you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value here .
of course , do you think that one receives a great value for £ 150 per year , but for people who is a lot of money for the 150 £ a lot of money , ask myself if that &apos;s true , because it does not consume much of the BBC .
the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 CEO David El@@ stein , who also testified before the Committee on Tuesday , called that the BBC should check out its Rei@@ th@@ ian mission to inform and maintain . &quot;
he said , only little from the BBC production would now officially classified as education , he said that it should be 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and they should change this change in public @-@ legal television channels in Australia and Canada as an example . &quot;
to the question of partner@@ ships , El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas such as the pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a hand@@ ful in television are displayed , and with commercial Sen@@ dern Alli@@ ances go down to make everything online .
&apos;@@ son@@ ogen@@ et@@ ics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the N@@ emat@@ odes change the direction at the moment in which it sh@@ ines with so@@ unding .
scientists have grown wor@@ ms with genet@@ ically modified nerv@@ ous systems that can be controlled by ou@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny n@@ emat@@ odes change the direction in the moment in which they have so@@ unding with sound pulse , which have to be heard for the human ear to high frequencies in order to be heard .
the pulses work through the in@@ line of Mot@@ one@@ ur@@ on cells that are genet@@ ically modified to react to the membrane channels that react on ultr@@ asound heads .
further to this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers stated the wor@@ ms of a new method , called son@@ ogen@@ et@@ ics , which can be used in ultr@@ asound in order to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
municipality of Srebrenica , researchers at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said the Guardian that the trial of one day could replace the depths of deep de@@ stim@@ ulation , an inv@@ as@@ ive method used for electrical im@@ pulses in the brain of Park@@ inson &apos;s disease .
mer@@ cil@@ ush@@ ers react not to ultr@@ asound , but Hal@@ as@@ ani established that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic air bub@@ bles .
the bub@@ bles , found out , rein@@ force the ultr@@ asound heads , which then enter wor@@ ms into wor@@ ms .
the increased ultrasonic shafts are based on structures that are known to TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels and are found in membran@@ es of some of the dice .
the sound waves beat the opening of these icons and enable the cells to whom they are allocated , such a report Nature Communications .
in order to create ultra @-@ controlled n@@ emat@@ odes , Chal@@ as@@ ani genet@@ ically modified the wor@@ ms so that some of their tr@@ one@@ on@@ oning TR@@ P @-@ 4 can be controlled .
if he used ultr@@ asound at the changing circles , the sound waves prop@@ elled by the micro@@ bl@@ os@@ ges and transferred into the wor@@ ms , where they switch the changed m@@ one@@ world .
the procedure has some simil@@ ar@@ ities with Op@@ to@@ genet@@ ics , a ground@@ breaking tool , which makes neur@@ ons with im@@ pulses of light and to turn off .
but Hal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ ogen@@ et@@ ics could have some advantages against this technique .
in contrast to light , which must be sent down to an optical fiber to the desired position in the brain , low frequency ultr@@ asound scan may happen without hin@@ dered and can therefore be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; we believe that genetic therapy and a therapeutic virus is possible to take temporary human neur@@ ons further due to the ultr@@ asound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurolog@@ ical treatments , &quot; said Hal@@ as@@ ani .
other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and ins@@ ulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

8 gold rules for life in student halls
eleven years ago I moved as self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old in a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral re@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the sm@@ ooth@@ ed smile of those who have been anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , many more durable complaints about others .
the most of what I have learned can be dist@@ illed in eight single rules .
the move in student halls reaches from easily su@@ ck@@ able up to absolute sho@@ ck@@ able up to absolute .
it is temp@@ ting to tie : people tell us how you get , if you are going on Sab@@ b@@ n and why you didn &apos;t really hate Mar@@ m@@ ite nor hate you because in Ernst , guys , it is just a yeast extract h@@ ah@@ aha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
bre@@ athe in through .
and help others to do the same - Make questions and show interest .
it direc@@ ts the conversation and helps people find out the people who would not like to say in contrast to those with which you would not say , even when your lashes were in fire and these fire extingu@@ ishers would be .
let people do humans .
the rooms of people are often converted into alcoholic recipes , film night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people are going to draw and under@@ wear their under@@ wear .
based on this : do not remember to start at the university with a relationship
introduction gave a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student halls form a space @-@ to @-@ room B@@ um@@ mel culture that is friendly and soci@@ ally and to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover himself .
nothing in the culture allows you to say , &quot; I like you , and I want to pass on our friendship , but you must go away to keep the energy , which I used for the interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a com@@ it@@ it@@ ability is exhau@@ sted - and send SMS message with SMS instead .
A@@ pro@@ po@@ s ank@@ lo@@ ps : do it .
a guy in my student halls had the idea that a non @-@ closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship include through baking .
since you start the university on the cli@@ max of the back man@@ ie , the kno@@ bs are going to set up with a plate full of Brow@@ ni@@ es , less wei@@ rd to the welcome of the 1950 &apos;s year &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I have something b@@ aked here . so , and now I smile when I ask you a few personal questions . &quot;
home @-@ made l@@ eck@@ wer@@ ies offer a good way to close attention .
their roomm@@ ates are committed to enter@@ tain and will di@@ lig@@ ently associate their face with a delicious surprise at the end .
of course , it depends on whether you are an independent b@@ aker .
bad@@ ly mixed cl@@ amps made of flour , sugar and fat , make sure that people imagine sleeping when you anchor .
to steal foods is a corrup@@ tible crime in student residence .
of course , the th@@ aw@@ ning of chicken is a theft , but is it take a mere drop of milk for your tea ?
check it with the milk yield .
the od@@ ds are good to say they are self @-@ operate even when cooking in the inside .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff is anno@@ ying , and you have my compassion , but try to deal with that balanced as my roomm@@ ates that added to her milk a pur@@ ge to raise th@@ iev@@ es .
she is now in prison .
they shou@@ ldn &apos;t make noise , who keeps people from sleep or from working .
it does not only mean to be a permanent man , but that you are among the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ ver@@ t to man who sit in the glass .
a girl on my way asked their neigh@@ bors if they make them a little bit qui@@ eter , so that there were three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a trial in the morning .
they re@@ acted to listen to music still .
when she heard about 5 pm they left their neighbours , kindly requested to sleep two hours , before they left their own music and ended her three @-@ hour examination .
would it be romantic if your future sp@@ ouse would be able to move into the same student dormitory ?
vice vers@@ a , it wouldn &apos;t be ab@@ oun@@ ded when you are working for your future sp@@ ouses to take part in it , and then go and see them every day and perhaps to experience how to re@@ loc@@ alize all common friends ?
of course the heart of her own path - but if a hot player is definitely not your future sp@@ ouses , try to speak at least to get a little reason .
in the exciting moment you notice that someone has its keys in its non @-@ closed room , the border between a ul@@ k and mo@@ b@@ bing is f@@ ist when it seems .
a good swe@@ ep is fun , but it takes only moments , until he is getting ready to catch .
spare parts through plug@@ ging in a precious and am@@ using lesson on safety - but th@@ au@@ ting someone &apos;s room with t@@ ooth@@ paste and sh@@ ampoo .
connect your door and place their keys into a glass of water which you then set in the freezer - but drives you have their owners at the ceiling no more than twice .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll show how you can still build and build right today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees will move on the housing market .
entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ deb@@ tors to know how quickly the inexpensive residential space can be created : he builds in a project terra@@ ced houses for refugees .
Mr. Gil@@ da , many refugees will move on the housing market .
which solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ deb@@ tors : the mass@@ acres of containers or g@@ ym@@ es have no sustainability .
for people stay in a great part here .
due to the refugee camp , we need enough living space in the next decades .
a completely ban@@ al , three @-@ storey con@@ front house is the solution .
Gil@@ deb@@ ated : a terra@@ ced house needs the least place .
it facilit@@ ates the integration .
this is different if people sub@@ du@@ ed in blocks .
each of the six houses , which are built just in the pilot project , consists of three units for four asylum seek@@ ers .
each residential unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it may be , that many refugees will say , it &apos;s peace , I go back .
then the houses can easily be converted into according to particular needs .
how high are the costs ?
Gil@@ bor@@ on : the price of 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 Euros , without land .
this is man@@ age@@ able .
the building took six months .
this is reasonable .
do the regulations allow their plans to be complicated ?
Gil@@ gues : I have moved my project correctly .
the adv@@ ancing Dam@@ o@@ rem , especially complicated , makes it more complicated .
gr@@ us@@ el@@ ig .
it will still teach , who creates three apartments in a row , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities is missing the place .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the residents adapt to their tow@@ n@@ house project ?
they were Gil@@ ded : they were accused of creating luxury constructions for asylum seek@@ ers .
what is definitely not right .
but are not tigh@@ tened to the compet@@ ences for paying apartments ?
Gil@@ ded : in the last five years we had a building boom in Germany , but built luxury apartments that can hardly be aff@@ ord more .
my project has the message , even the normal people need living space .
not only refugees , but also the mother @-@ alone mother or the od@@ th@@ ener .
I &apos;ll show how you can still build and build right today .
that is why it goes .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone OS when Apple update will be released
the new operating system can be requested by selecting the Settings App , select &quot; General &quot; and then select &quot; Software Update . &quot;
when it &apos;s ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install .
some of them are fixed after installation , because it is getting an error message that correc@@ ts that the &quot; software update is missing . &quot;
to avoid the problem , users are advised to wait until the look@@ out is returned or try to update via iTunes .
the phone itself leads you through the rest of the process .
this may mean the del@@ eting of Apps to make place - but Apple has done this because of the dis@@ covering of updates un@@ likely . likewise it will be easier to delete it when using a special tool to install apps once the process is completed .
it &apos;s worth to ensure your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charge unit so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple is not going to rest@@ rain the update because the phone will probably shut down on half way and that could lead to a break of updates .

Dr. Frank Müller takes part in the field of Fel@@ low and invests approx . 3@@ 10000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ low .
in addition , also Sam@@ bo@@ de@@ ye@@ master Bernd Bor@@ mann , econom@@ ist U@@ ta S@@ eim @-@ Schwartz and As@@ endor@@ fs Mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert .

while Ur@@ sel stays stepped into the re@@ tire , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is his successor in the next few months still with half a spot to the side .
after a reconstruction phase , Müller began back on October 12th until then he invested 3@@ 10,000 euros to the premises at the St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ straße 6 .
it was sympath@@ y at first sight , as the rock faces before years Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll know who currently manages their specialist training in the German hospital , and who wants to enter in practice this year too .
&quot; we always had in mind that the gar@@ bage can be fit well in practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ low breaks and laugh@@ s .
&quot; when it happened , I simply have called it . &quot;
the couple pleased the idea to operate his own practice in As@@ endorf .
&quot; the proximity to the patients are very attractive for us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller .
&quot; we want to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot;
as an advantage , he also see to be his own boss .
and so they were united with the gar@@ bage trucks bought the house with practice .
they continue to live in Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
he also grew up the two @-@ time family father Frank Müller , his medical studies in Hanover , followed by stations in several medical practices and hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .

as of September 19 , the new boss will be prepared for the new boss .
during the surgery Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ low as a medical specialist has specialised his wife Ur@@ sel ( Inter@@ ni@@ st@@ ine ) in Gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology .
the gar@@ bage trucks , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to be settled as house doctors .

&quot; this shows how proud and joy@@ ful we are that the practice will continue , emphas@@ izes Sam@@ t@@ gener@@ al@@ oft Bernd Bor@@ mann .
approximately 2000 patients come to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll every quarter in the practice of Fel@@ low breaks , in the North German Average group practice &#91; 500 &#93; .
in As@@ endorf there is another house practice yet .
a positive side effect of practice by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ low in As@@ endorf .
if no successor would have been found , it would also have gone .
who visits the gar@@ ners of conversation , see the way above all in familiar faces : takes over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning force of the rock faces .
their f@@ arewell dinner ends in A@@ endorf , after all , the medical profession holds 30 years there .
&quot; at the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; re@@ members Ur@@ sel Fel@@ low breaks .
a little thro@@ ug can feel it after the long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and many patients are still visible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Inter @-@ ni@@ st@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
your husband is compl@@ ying with : &quot; we have a 6000 square meter property . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I have pressed me before gar@@ dening me , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees through &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the border controls are lifted at our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Interior Minister Johanna Mic@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain parallel in parallel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is clear that everyone who wants to put an asylum request also could &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the supply and security of human beings stand in the fore@@ ground .
but it is clear that it needs clear signal , &quot; the Minister said .
people must know that we do not accept bound@@ less mig@@ rat@@ ory streams , nor beyond the Austrian @-@ Slovenian border .
it needs a controlled procedure .
Croatia weak@@ ened &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia is ref@@ using
the Croatian government previously announced that Slovenia would continue to travel to Austria and Germany in the direction of Austria and Germany , and may also establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
quite so , this is what the Minister for the Minister of Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ head Z@@ ni@@ dar , however , did not see him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be absolutely in@@ acceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia would rather to be the supervision of the border - intensi@@ vely for Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is already controlled by the border with Croatia as the outside level of the Sch@@ en@@ gen@@ ial region .
as the Minister has stressed , Slo@@ veni@@ ans wants to bear his limits for refugees but not factories .
&quot; every EU member must fill its obligations ; otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; berat@@ ing@@ Gy@@ ör@@ head Z@@ ni@@ dar .
as the Croatian Government believes , the first refugees have already tried in the night hours for Tuesday to go to the border of T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ ID on the border crossing the T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ ID border .
in the Croatian police , she was able to attack them in the near corn@@ fields .
according to local media , since then , in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , real police vehicles have ever been involved with new refugees .
it was mainly used by Syrians and Afghanistan , among them numerous women and children .
the service life and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days his country crossed the country with some 4,000 refugees , said Interior Minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
Moreover , buses from Pre@@ se@@ vo were headed by Pre@@ se@@ vo on the ed@@ onian border of Macedonia , which had previously transferred to the Hungarian border to Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
the government in Belgrade , however , denied that it is necessary to submit certain rout@@ ines : &quot; neither can we do , nor want to do this , &quot; said it .
according to media reports , a first bus with around 50 refugees arrive in the Bosnian Serb Republic of S@@ ID , in the morning , during the day , more buses would expect .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants were on the road all the night of some 500 kilometres distant from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border .
&quot; we have heard that Hungary has made , so the police said that we should go there , &quot; said one of the refugees .
you wanted to travel through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria further to Germany .
this means that there could have been predic@@ ting the predicted shi@@ fting of the previous Balk@@ ans Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a little further west .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive options for limit control &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic pointed out that his country had prepared appropriate plans for the case of strong condition of refugees for possible trips situation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he did not pray , but he pointed out that Croatia declared a comprehensive potential for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Non @-@ Schengen Agreement &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you will maintain strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have passed since then a good report that concerns the standard of border controls .
on Serbian side the Hungarian border continued to eng@@ age about 300 refugees .
according to the media reports , they have had the past night at the border crossing hor@@ g@@ os , who leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border controls Hor@@ g@@ os and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely locked .
whether the remaining refugees go on to the Croatian border , is still un@@ clear .
the Serbian Minister of the Interior , Neb@@ oj@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic still tried on Wednesday audience in her home . he still hold the debates about alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed , for early breakfast .
it is currently not advis@@ able to act very high refugees .
one could not say if they would continue their journey over Hungary , Croatia or another country .
assistant rates of migrants to - dangerous entities
however , private Hungarian Refu@@ ge@@ es have already begun to distribute the maps of land cards , which are shown for alternative routes through Croatia .
but the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not harm@@ less : in parts of the border area there is also 20 years after the end of Croatia yet not cleared min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine was sent across the region .

Sup@@ et@@ on@@ ok is said to have been a ring of Cyber@@ crime who has been accused of having gone up into un@@ published financial Reports and press releases on sites such as Business Wire , Marketing , and PR News@@ wire since 2010 .
with the explo@@ ited information ought to have been in@@ sider trading on the financial markets .
in this way , an investigation conducted over 100 million dollars in total .
&quot; the current comparison shows that even those outside of our borders are ultimately tra@@ pped , &quot; the SEC @-@ communication is stated .
the processes against 32 further dra@@ fts in the case lasted .
most of the accused are from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpet@@ rators are to have taken out both in the USA and from Eastern Europe .

the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical cour@@ t@@ assistance made it attention to its 20 @-@ year anniversary and sees itself to con@@ fron@@ ted with mixed reactions .
&quot; it is life , so we are going to enter into the city in the middle of the city and among people , &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer .
the head of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical curves is available as well as questions and talks at the disposal of the volunte@@ er staff .

again , on the edge of discussions about the action of thinking about the life , dealing with the dying .
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is just on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only if I make sure that at the end of this world , I can responsi@@ bly live , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the director of the Di@@ ak@@ onic works Mannheim , which is together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ ian tro@@ pi@@ as &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore this partial effective action for the 20 year old was good .
not everyone can change to the tables , however , be under@@ stand@@ able , finally , it was a very personal thing .
the theme of death and death is not liable to as before with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , even the experience of the hosp@@ ice movement in the past few years has contributed much to the people open .
a assessment put on Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ ro@@ id .
the death and tragedy belongs to the volunte@@ er staff of the first hour .
being con@@ fron@@ ted with the theme of personal experi@@ encing , she read a lot of literature and decided to eng@@ age in the discipline .
when the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ an A@@ id was seeking a call for a volunte@@ er , she immediately announced and was in 1995 when it was founded .
Go@@ def@@ ro@@ id belongs to a team of 45 volunte@@ er - 43 women and two men - the interested in private households , hospitals , nurs@@ ing secret and hosp@@ ice ( Saint Vincent ) .
they are all carefully trained .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see life from another war@@ te , keep it for precious and weak , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the offer of the ambul@@ atory E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ ight is free and conf@@ is@@ ation@@ ally dependent .
financial support of the insurance companies and donations of relatives and insurance permits the training as well as training and super@@ divisions of the death and tragedy .
all two years of training are offered for new employees .
the plates that are described above are now in the house of the Protestant Church ( M1 , 1a ) and in the house of the Catholic Church ( F2 , 6 ) .

F@@ ed@@ Ex is mixed with financial outlook for 2016
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports a dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the Lie@@ ber @-@ Gig@@ ant sen@@ su@@ ed his profit margin for a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in his boat transport .
the company also said that she plans to start about 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for vacation purposes .
at this time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to set 50,000 seasonal workers for the vacation period .
the share was over 2.5 percent in pre @-@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a profit of $ 10,@@ 40 and $ 10.@@ 90 in the business year , which ends in the next year , 20 cents less than at previous forecast .
an@@ alysts expect according to a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10,@@ 84 $ .
the lower level comes in spite of the price increases , which will be at an average of 4.9 percent and on January 4 , despite higher supplements for bo@@ d@@ goods transport and large packages that will be collected from November .
the company stated that it is still expecting to increase the result from the previous year due to cost reduction , higher income and growth for growth in online trading .
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company provides a solid income when you saw the weaker economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade .
the plans for the holiday @-@ employment have announced a day later than the Ri@@ val@@ en UPS , which plans to hire 9@@ 0,000 - 9@@ 5,000 additional workforce , roughly the same number as last year .
in the second quarter , which ended on August 31 , F@@ ed@@ Ex served 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
the earnings per share amounted to 2.@@ 42 $ per share , nearly after the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve by Z@@ acks Investment Research , asked An@@ alysts predi@@ ct .
sales increased by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion dollars .
six of st@@ acks asked an@@ alysts expect 12.@@ 23 billion $ .
in recent years F@@ ed@@ Ex had a decline in international priority press writing , which brought sales to stag@@ n@@ ating in its unit Express Shipping .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex ground .
during the last quarter sales increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for greater package and self @-@ insurance .
the Express Group declined higher income due to higher prices , while the result was working for higher production costs in the cargo business .
at market trade , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed Ex shares declined by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,15 $ .
on Tuesday , they concluded with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11th .
during their most expected conference in the years , Federal Reserve Strat@@ os spend two days this week round a 27 @-@ foot Honduras @-@ Mah@@ ag@@ oni @-@ Table to decide whether it &apos;s time to raise the motto for the first time since almost a decade .
threatened with them at an end of the emb@@ ell@@ ished , two @-@ story seat sa@@ wing is a mur@@ al of the United States .
the card is remin@@ ded that the F@@ ed @-@ president Jan@@ et L. Y@@ els and her colleagues will put together the economic interests of the Nation before all other things .
the Central Bank has a double @-@ fold order of the congress : maxim@@ ize US employment and prices stable here .
but since the major recession , the F@@ ed leader has recognized that it has been an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate might be the X @-@ factor in a decision to predi@@ ct them . it will be announced on Thursday if the U.S. economy is ready to be we@@ aned from the unprecedented interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most data of the economy clearly show that they could rock solid , the youngest turbo@@ chargers in the global financial markets mean to increase these volume levels by the interest of interest rate for federal bonds , and it is also just a quarter percentage point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation was the most important thing that they observe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief economy at the company &amp; Co . Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to increase the interest rate , the increased un@@ certainty about the global market is enough justi@@ fication , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no con@@ sens@@ us about what the F@@ ed will do , which as@@ sures himself the financial market un@@ sec@@ ures .
about half of the econom@@ ists , which were recently inter@@ viewed from Bloom@@ berg , have predicted a rate of interest in this week .
financial markets , however , expect a wait for the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance to raise an increase .
this indicates a decline of the stock market , if the F@@ ed has increased the proposition , unless the strateg@@ ists are spac@@ ed , they promise that a further increase is far away .
in the Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial average rose by 2@@ 28.@@ 89 points or 1.4 % on 16.@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy informed the sentence in this week , John Lon@@ ski , Chief econom@@ ist at Moody &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would raise the propositions at that time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they do it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have to calm far in their declaration to calm the financial markets , so that they do not fall in pan@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argu@@ ed that an interest of interest to the financial markets would be calm because it would eliminate un@@ certainty when the F@@ ed will act .
still a month , the F@@ ed appeared on good way to increase the set of 0.25 percentage points in this month , the first little step in a slow con@@ gest@@ ion of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ella had said in the spring and in the early summer of summer , that this year despite the liber@@ als of Liber@@ als , more economically progress would be necessary to increase the sentence .
although the creation of jobs in August slow@@ ed down , there was a sound improvement in the labour market this year .
the unemployment rate declined to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for over seven years and close to the level which the F@@ ed looks as full employment .
wage improvements have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly under the target of 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed @-@ Repres@@ ants said that the main reason is the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
the economy &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and needs them due to the tension around the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ d@@ son , Chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ media .
but the financial markets gathered all over the world at the end of the month , after China had rated its currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial average was lower in May by more than 16 % below its maximum , while investors feared that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would thr@@ ott@@ le the global growth .
the market recovered slightly in this month , whereas the Dow now lasts almost 10 % below the high season .
for the F@@ ed @-@ Representative , the market tur@@ bul@@ ence influence the complex lime treatment as you should raise the interest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the events in the financial markets and news about the weakness of the Chinese economy would not have occurred in recent weeks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stephen O@@ lin@@ ers , Senior Research Fel@@ low at the U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former staff of the U.S. dollar bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now he predi@@ ct that they will wait at least one month to get the impact better in the handle .
&quot; there is a lot of un@@ certainty about what the impact on the U.S. economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ lin@@ ers .
the health of the world economy is none of the major causes of the F@@ ed , therefore it should not be related technically in decision @-@ making .
but in the final effect , the F@@ ed monetary authority has become the world .
the impact of the central bank has grown enorm@@ ously in recent years .
the mere note of the then Director Ben S. Bern@@ ad@@ ke in 2013 that the F@@ ed could find their monetary expansion &quot; tight , &quot; dissolved some tur@@ bul@@ ations around the world .
in a world where markets and econom@@ ies are increasingly dar@@ ed , it can monitor from the F@@ ed @-@ Representative , that they will not only discuss the developments in other areas , but also with other central banks and experts to obtain a better understanding for global economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their decision @-@ making is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more art than science , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for the management of the company En@@ vest@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jeffrey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has linked up a history of inter@@ actions on financial market movements with apparently not associated with the economic foundation data . &quot;
L@@ acker , voted member of the Federal Open Market Committee , which counts for an interest , quoted decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce its head@@ line by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; despite lim@@ iting effects on growth in the US , &quot; L@@ acker said .
one year later , the F@@ ed representative made this cuts .
the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability during a severe crisis like the market am@@ us@@ ement of 2008 to the first place , Adam S. Poznań , former member of the Committee on the interest of the Bank of England .
the youngest tur@@ mo@@ il are not coming near to this level , he said .
&quot; she certainly doesn &apos;t want to come into the situation in which she was afraid of interest in interest , &quot; said Pozn@@ an , president of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and mentioned not the financial stability , and until that is altered , I don &apos;t think that it should be the time of pen@@ ile .

Bras@@ ili@@ ze pap@@ di@@ at@@ ric society Rio Grande enh@@ ances nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pedi@@ at@@ ric organization SP@@ RS tries to clari@@ fy women how important good nutrition while nurs@@ ing time is . you do this with the presentation of pictures of babies that are nour@@ ished from breasts that are painted with represent@@ ations of un@@ healthy food .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates , those babies provide all the nutrients needed to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers get advised to increase their daily calories by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research results indicate that a higher cal@@ orie intake did not supply the only di@@ eting adaptation to mothers .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that healthy food @-@ inspired women affects the genes of their babies and protects them before the development of tum@@ ours .
unfortunately , a healthy diet of the child may affect the immune system negative .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ k Sports Hall
the Municipal Council Bern@@ ried approved the construction proposal for the 2,3 million euros of expensive sport hall .
and he was one exception .
the roof can be flat for solar installations .
the planning for the long @-@ awa@@ ited g@@ ym@@ ale at the Bern@@ rie@@ k Sport@@ grounds are step by step ahead : in the youngest member of the meeting , the worked building procedure was blessed without large discussions .
in the previous year , the panel was based on a legal &quot; legal &quot; legal framework for the Liberation of the current construction plan .
in the &quot; exception &quot; it was possible to permit a special form concerning the roof structure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ enclosed first and roof top &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is therefore to be built . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned use of the roof area for solar plants : &quot; thus we get a wonderful Sü@@ dd@@ ach together , &quot; explained Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the session .
upon the Liberation , in turn , it went back to the roof of the roof , which is prescribed for energet@@ ic reasons - but it is supposed to be in the development plan - below ten degrees .
the volume of the hall will therefore be reduced significantly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan does not allow for any &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the Bern@@ rie@@ k Municipal Council is usually de@@ struc@@ tive for the Liberation contracts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , in turn @-@ like this is no recur@@ ring project : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger .
the gym at the sports centre is a community project of the community and SV Bern@@ ried .
at cost , some 2.3 million euros are registered .
supplements are expected by the school and lat@@ itud@@ inal promotion .
in the next step of proce@@ eding , the construction proposal is to be submitted for the 18 x 36 meter space in the country &apos;s coun@@ sel@@ or .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg gets to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg is scheduled to be closed in earlier than planned - namely 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) will be the new Director of the Sch@@ ong@@ au hospital .

the view of the surprising plans of the Hospital GmbH of the district authority confirmed that the country &apos;s coun@@ sel@@ ess Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White confirmed that .

the vast majority should be surrounded by fishermen and the further existing railway station after Sch@@ ong@@ au .

on the question who needs to take succession , according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; entered the game that declared to take over leadership and change his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au as of October 1 .
for the House in Sch@@ ong@@ au this in every case is an &quot; appreci@@ ation &quot; and a spread of the offer in the area of Internal Medicine , &quot; such as J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
fishermen is a specialist for heart pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ator .

over@@ rides for the next two years , Fischer with his team , if the Supervisory Board is agreed to grant two houses until then , next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ y , which has over 35 beds , will be finally closed at P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after nearly 140 years .
the administrative district is planned for 2018 , when the currently ongoing renovation at the W@@ eil@@ heim hospital is completed .
coun@@ sel@@ ess J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , who is also chairman of the Supervisory Board , rum@@ oured that the house , which is in possession of the federal government , is to be used as an accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I close my soul . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it goes with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White couldn &apos;t say there are several consider@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at present there is a short @-@ time care of the Car@@ itas and a Tag@@ esp@@ sy@@ chiat@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity is not again &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; so Fischer over the qu@@ asi @-@ moving to the Le@@ ch , who had been received by the employees &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very discre@@ et &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house where Fischer has worked as a chief physician for over 30 years , haven &apos;t been given it .
he has asked of Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of the Medical Director .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was threatened by closure . it was threatened by closure , departments became closed , for example the Surgery and Obst@@ et@@ rics .

after a shot , a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered heavy injuries and were brought in hospitals .
just as it could occurred to the accident , was initially un@@ clear .
the crimin@@ als were determined .
16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate victims of violent crimes
a crime of poor has led the police to the tune of the 16 year olds among Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
at the age of the 20 @-@ year @-@ old , the young people were killed and their dead allies have thrown into a canal in Rock@@ enhausen .

the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was reported to be reported on Sunday morning after it had not been agreed on the eve after a visit to an autumn visit in Rock@@ enhausen .
in search of the young woman the investig@@ ators had first put on personal objects of the victim .
a crime against the 20 year old in the Fre@@ un@@ des@@ - and acquain@@ t@@ ance of the insur@@ rection there was a crime against the 20 year old .

refugees need units : study war@@ ns against housing
the situation in the German housing market is quite anxi@@ ous .
even more refugees seek a budget stay .
printing on the housing market is growing .
social housing is facing a challenge .
the distribution events on the German housing market have long begun .
with the adv@@ ent refugees and seek@@ ers from the EU more people are on a market that is already over@@ loaded in many big cities .
they compete with welcome citizens over the last paid dwellings .
in order to cover demand for cheap apartments , 400,000 new units have to be built by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this result represents a study in the mission of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social housing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
by comparison , in Germany 26@@ 0,000 units are finished in Germany .
a total of 14@@ 0,000 dwellings are missing .
refugees are not obliged after the first three months of their stay to live as asylum seek@@ ers in a living room .
many of them falls on the housing market and rows into the long wheel@@ chairs in front of the rental apartments .
however , according to the Federal Statist@@ ical Office , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers stayed last year .
but the negative development of the housing market is not only the rising of the refugee market .
the study also brings significant changes in the residential building policy of the last years .
Germany Shi@@ ites is a residential property that is to be increased from year to year .
at present , Matthias Günther , author of the study had already been missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas , and Matthias Günther , author of the study .
many professionals in those cities were therefore listed in large cities in the WG @-@ rooms .
young adults were un@@ will@@ ingly offered for the house@@ keeping market volunte@@ er for longer in the &quot; Hotel Mama . &quot;
in the big cities the number of square metres per capita has decreased from the last years .
in order to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; Social housing construction &quot; suggests a re@@ boot .
new incenti@@ ves of social housing are supposed to be tra@@ cked again .
such that the property tax could be ren@@ ounces and the property tax for subsidi@@ zed flats will be suspended .
furthermore , according to the Alliance attractive tax write options are needed .
the promotion programme for refugee races of the State Bank Kf@@ W has now been good for cities and communities now .
a good week after the start was on Monday evening with 184 million euros more than half of the costs available to approximately 300 million euros .
now the project could even be sc@@ aled .
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia
according to Hungary , practically no pass is more , since more refugees play the way over Croatia .
Zagreb announces , through the passage through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate in the neighboring country of Slovenia over the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talked with the Slovenian Minister of the Interior , and when it &apos;s necessary we will organize a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Croatian Interior Minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia is situated between Croatia and Austria and is part of the Schengen area .
the EU @-@ Land of Croatia is not a Schengen country yet .
after the de@@ position of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees arrive to Croatia to reach Europe from there .
500 people have come across the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , Croatian television broadcast@@ ers reported RTL Television .
Hungary had to sealed its border for refugees on the previous day .
new laws passed into force on the same day make super@@ flu@@ ous asylum procedures in Hungary .
Croatia wants to pass the refugees .
Croatian Minister Zoran Mil@@ ano@@ vic explained : &quot; they can go through and we prepare for this possibility . &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and want to achieve something .
but there are people who didn &apos;t want to live in Croatia .
in the morning , the Croatian police seized the first refugees at the Serbia &apos;s border with Croatia .
most of media reports indicate that in Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came both with the bus and taxi on the Serbian border city S@@ ID .
immediately after their arrival they would have been trying to go through the green border to Croatia .
on the Croatian @-@ Serb border , refugees do not encounter a fence .
there are other haz@@ ards along the border : there are still sharp mines there from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s .
Min@@ ority Days should now create quickly a safe passage .
after Hungary , the border reaches barely more refugees after the closure of the border .
on Tuesday , the police counted around 366 .
shortly before departure on Monday , there were still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws , the over@@ coming and damage of the border to us as stra@@ ft@@ on .
therefore , 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the South @-@ Hungarian border of Sz@@ eged .
the pen@@ alties thre@@ aten to up to five years and deportation from the country .
according to the immig@@ ration authorities , we have received a total of 94 asylum seek@@ ers on Tuesday , of which almost all - 93 - on the main passage R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
among the applic@@ ants , 13 families with small children and two older people are families .
on Wednesday morning there are 40 refugees met there .
practically , no one has granted a view to Hungary for asylum in Hungary .
according to Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; secure third country . &quot;
the past asylum seek@@ ers are to be deported there .
just a few hundred refugees met before the &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ one &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , workers began to get back .
they gathered the rub@@ b@@ ish , which tens of thousands of people left in the road@@ side over the last weeks .
pl@@ ywood were dismant@@ led and rebuilt one of the excav@@ ation camp in the bound@@ ary .
without the aim of this building , nobody wanted to voice .
Austria only has a few refugees after the closing of the border between Serbia and Hungary .
in addition , the country has reinforced its border controls .
but 20,000 migrants have stayed in the country for government information .
around 1400 people wait for the further journey to Germany in Salzburg .
the train service from there to Germany was stopped by the German authorities in the morning .
in free@@ zeout , smaller groups of refugees met on foot .
Mayor of &quot; rocks &quot; over the border
&quot; we were after the bridge @-@ ceremony on Sunday with the Auf@@ bereit@@ ungst@@ ers there , when suddenly ten people were occupied with train@@ ers at the entrance of the tent , &quot; W@@ ern@@ st@@ one Mayor in Alois Stad@@ ler .
tourists , they wanted to move to Pass@@ au .
because Germany on Sunday but because of the refugee @-@ est@@ rogen with Austria was sur@@ pris@@ ingly , he was in W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s conclusion , &quot; so called &quot; Stad@@ ler who immediately opened his help with two other hel@@ pers and their cars connected by the border to the close in Pass@@ au .
first we set up the un@@ hop@@ ed guests only once , with snack and drinks .
we were right , we drive them by car to Pass@@ au .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was true of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the city of O@@ Ö@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grat@@ eful .
a man did not take it to hand a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is very pleased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the stran@@ ded train related animals were converted to a regional train in Wels on Sunday evening in a regional train to Pass@@ au , in order to be closed after the short term , that the rail transport was set to Germany still on the border .
the regional train was de@@ commissioned in W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s border in front of the Inn border .
in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border @-@ crossing was generally high in the course .
the bridge @-@ firm with the Bavarian neighbours ten@@ ded on Sunday , day before a bridge sporty - organized by Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
Viktor Or@@ b@@ án now sends more then thousands of thousands to us , is a logical result of a seem@@ ingly holy policy :
rather than in the camp of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , during the erection of structures , our German Chancellor , highly officially approved and public@@ ised the attitude of Hungarian government in the Dun@@ st@@ ony of National Soci@@ alism .
Lei@@ d@@ bearing these policies are not only those Austri@@ ans , who are now con@@ fron@@ ted in the bound@@ ary areas with cha@@ otic states .
the poultry has also to state that the &quot; yellow land &quot; that they invited to us and welcomed them , nothing but another refugee camp .
there will be a major challenge in view of the lasting refugee flows and the nearby wind to produce a de@@ cent condition for safety seek@@ ers .
and there will be one more bigger - peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad on the search for 35,000 w@@ inter@@ solid quartz
Konrad has to fully put all hands with the refugee rules .
Christian Konrad is certain that his word has weight .
the government has used the previous powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen Ban@@ ker to present the quarters of the thousands of refugees .
the chaos at the beginning of the centre of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , Konrad has already got a grip on the right .
&quot; we have no hom@@ eless more in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported on his first success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lodging of the 20,000 refugees that came to Austria on Monday was without great action , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad Adenauer addressed the organisation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Master performance &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Interior Ministry spoke , on the other hand , by a &quot; cold @-@ tale situation . &quot;
in total , Konrad is expecting a total demand of 85@@ ,000 quartz in the hot year .
in order to meet the numbers , you must still find more 35,000 homes in the next few weeks - 20,000 to prepare the countries , 15,000 of the covenant .
if there are more refugees , we can do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is no barrel without floor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already led discussions with the state governments .
these would have been promised to create , even for the next refugee camps .
&quot; in Upper Austria , &quot; Ferry Mai@@ er said it .
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ ar supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christophe Schön@@ born , which should be clari@@ fied as the church will help .
big expectations will be committed to the As@@ ylum Co@@ ordin@@ ator in the ORF promotion &quot; or as we are . &quot;
on the platform you can offer private individuals un@@ complicated accommodations .
in addition , it is hop@@ ing for hotels that are empty in the winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ised the standards for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in case of emergency , it could not be that qu@@ arti@@ ce must maintain a certain height of the hand tu@@ b@@ holder or size of the duties .
for a temporary period , &quot; Emer@@ ging standards would have to apply .
in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior by the Ministry of Suc@@ cess , Konrad was justified with his experience .
I am an older Lord , whom one does not say without further into the face of the un@@ true face .
persu@@ ader power is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Mai@@ er cause the Republic no cost as they declared themselves .
their employee numbers are to increase their number from three to four .
the own ro@@ ost search have not yet been successful yet .
Konrad tried to establish a container at the eph@@ an@@ splatz in the office .
however there are evi@@ d@@ ently issue with permission .
Linz requires a better distribution
initially no opening of local sports and other buildings like tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for the accommodation of refugees also planning the city of Linz .
this is not necessary because the suffer@@ ers are currently able to accommodate these measures without these measures , Mayor Klaus Lug@@ er ( SP ) says .
but other locations are to be tested for bar@@ g@@ ness .
critic@@ ising the head of directors within the breakdown of refugees within the federal state .
other districts have to be made here .
Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er : &quot; borders are not sealed . &quot;
in a longer telephone conference with the Bavarian Prime Minister , Horst Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Josef P@@ stir@@ inger ( VP ) sent a further incident at the refugee quot@@ as on Monday .
Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er has covered me that German borders are not sealed .
the further study of refugees in the Federal Republic may continue to be possible .
however , it is appropriate to set the respective border controls .
in order to avoid special privileg@@ es to Germany , there won &apos;t be any more .
however , the seek@@ ers would have brought together regular journeys to Germany .
in other EU member states , P@@ ehr@@ inger requested more boo@@ sted solidarity in the refugee quot@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that now Austria goes to its limits to its limits , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stir@@ rer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a logical consequence of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next R@@ unt@@ astic is a matter of time
the re@@ organisation of the &quot; New ship@@ yard &quot; at the Lin@@ zer Industry is officially completed .
in four of the six store@@ ys of the office and production buildings , the fair IT Group S &amp; T is incorporated , the rest ( 2700 square metres ) is to be hired to young , innovative companies from the technology range .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT the wise heads are our raw material - and we are trying to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; T boss Hannes Low @-@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could imagine that start @-@ up companies in the new ship@@ yard in start@@ up and later also to acquire that .
even from the beginning , S &amp; T wants to co@@ operate with the new neighbours - some of which is surprising : &quot; the next R@@ unt@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
1.7 million euros have been invested by S &amp; T in the location , 3.3 million Euros from the Tech@@ center , which belongs to a third of the city of Linz , the Land of Upper Austria and the Federation ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is on lease from the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ center .
about 30 percent of the 2700 square meters of rest in the building are already rented , for an additional 40 percent there is in@@ quiries .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ trainer opened second shop in the ar@@ cade
in the new shop Fur@@ la @-@ hand@@ bags are in the center .
actually , Jutta Bre@@ it was trying to take a dog .
this project had to de@@ pl@@ eted the 49 @-@ year old partner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ern Market Event . finally , she now has an increase in the form of another business area .
in the Fur@@ la @-@ shop towards business , in which it sells pockets , suitcase , shoes and threads of different manufacturers , all around the Fur@@ la @-@ Wall@@ ets could be turned over from 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories will cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
several weeks ago was rebuilt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have long laid out if I want to open a store , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Bre@@ c . &quot; &quot; &quot;
decisive for the decision was among others that also the Fur@@ la @-@ producers , which are in Bologna at home , from the idea of an own site , where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only one in the Greater Region Linz , who sell these brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters that even have Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
your fashion interest has got a cra@@ dle of her mother in the cra@@ dle .
I am most anno@@ ying with me if something has been developed and I can show new trends at competitive prices .
why even so some woman at the appearance of a beautiful hand@@ bag in a decoration is also able to answer your professional lady with the last certainty .
perhaps it is possible to get up a beautiful bag of every out@@ fit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ a
the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Night of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose inhabit@@ ant are called .
this property also connects to the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for any exc@@ itement .
if he tells a strange host@@ ile , journalist Rü@@ de is manifested or knowledge of knowledge in the international crisis policy - candidates for the US presidential office and ag@@ it@@ ating the election campaign .
and cuts so well .
this is also registered in the pe@@ ac@@ ian town of K@@ all@@ a , where the real estate of the estate has been mill@@ il@@ ica .
the New York office with the conc@@ ili@@ fr@@ is@@ ur is a term to many in the wine @-@ road on the wine road .
at the 1200 @-@ inhabitants , over @-@ eigh@@ ty corners with him is related to it .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Palat@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in the election campaign .
the ran@@ it@@ ant Simone Wen@@ del had turned a movie by tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers about his goal to become the most powerful man of the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe you find that somehow exciting , but there are no more deeply impressed in her original kind , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Simone Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ ese has filmed a am@@ using documentary about the location and his famous spro@@ uts , in addition to Tr@@ ump also the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts .
Tr@@ ump , who is not known for recipi@@ ent , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ a &quot; ( 2014 ) also in word - with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in bulk .
king of the hearts did he not bring it there .
although there is respect for the family &apos;s performance , but tend to say that Tr@@ ump &quot; is &quot; a bit a big Mo@@ or@@ l &quot; says Wen@@ del .
the h@@ ull@@ ary name , &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher , &quot; is located in the plain , &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - too high : the ep@@ onym , says them .
tr@@ ump is thus coming out of the village of the ep@@ onym .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 1885 when the last grandfather of grandfather started and opened a place for Gold@@ dig@@ s in the USA .
corn@@ erst@@ one of the Real Estate company were first land purchases in New York .
but life of the grand@@ parents was not free of Tra@@ y : their wish to return to your hom@@ eland , failed on the Bavarian state to which the Palat@@ inate was back then .
he did not accept Tr@@ ump , because he once was without permission to be hoo@@ ked up , the Director of the Institute of P@@ ou@@ pe@@ an History and Eth@@ no@@ graphy , Roland Paul , was declared a film release .
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of a &quot; illegal emig@@ ration . &quot;
this is stated in contrast to the mit@@ t mark statements of the descendants .
it was repeatedly spoken about Mexican immig@@ rants in the US and demanded the construction of a limit wall to make illegal immig@@ rants .
&quot; as the polish , which is not so lik@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a dist@@ illed tr@@ um@@ ps ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a born Tr@@ ump , the op@@ a was born Heinz &quot; ) .
the win@@ emaker in retirement looks like the Americans rather dist@@ anced , &quot; he is always so temper@@ ed . &quot;
believed he that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
he never car@@ es around K@@ all@@ a . &quot;
the Pen@@ si@@ dies , in Veron@@ ika Sch@@ ramm , as a man of a man , that a desc@@ endant of the family Heinz came with a visit to a visit to the church organ , which ended in general .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can not imagine a Donald , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Karl Stef@@ ano@@ vic and Lisa Wil@@ k@@ inson makes for Can@@ ber@@ ra to report in connection to the loss of leadership of the Liber@@ als , but it has no major shi@@ fts in the reviews for Today .

in Today , a slight increase compared to the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but his figure remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .

the new drama on a recently promised father , who decided to retreat in New Zealand with his two children , reaching a very impressive number of 1,@@ 219 million viewers .
critics were wonder@@ ed if Thomson had a hit @-@ show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
the result of yesterday evening insi@@ sted with a clear &quot; Yes . &quot;
the X @-@ Factor of Seven stayed strong with 1,@@ 136 million viewers and beat slightly The block ( 8@@ 38@@ ,000 ) and T@@ BL Famil@@ ies ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Chase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 5.@@ 30 ) of the new quiz show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ e@@ fe determined on average 4@@ 46@@ ,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) j@@ ump@@ ed to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over the Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires hot @-@ Seat ( 6@@ 13,000 ) .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
mystery revealed ? ...
reading of L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki probably have evi@@ d@@ ently , who wins the Bachelor .
the woman , during the Bachelor Wood &apos;s Bachelor in The Bachelor , was covered in greatest secrets .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not give up whether they are the one who received the last rose .
but when we were with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows on the day before coming from three two , you checked , you might have given a notice that you may be the winner .
Sam Wood will sealed its lips to the finals on Thursday .
all three women have left in the ly@@ rical manner , why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of hum@@ or , amb@@ ition , family values and positive attitude as the reasons why they would like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who shall receive the last Rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; might their responses to be created , who won the heart of the ri@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both quickly - apart from himself - M@@ ack@@ ay as best partner in Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood had had a simple relationship from the first day .
&quot; from the moment I went to the house and ( Sar@@ ah ) and Sam@@ s energies , I felt that they were rather in@@ compatible , and I have thought all of the show in the whole course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sarah has two feet on the earth , making it so much fun to be with her &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have seen them along , and they have the right chemistry .
they feel pleasant and comfortable .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood are well suited as a couple .
from their point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the house visit will make her clear that Wood &quot; of One &quot; could be .
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and the family it was clear that this is obviously not just a game - I am w@@ rest@@ ra@@ ining him on him , &quot; she said .
and when it was asked that the wood should be chosen unless they were , there was en@@ ig@@ matic .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said .
I love the remaining girls equally - it &apos;s a Draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor is broadcast@@ ed on ten on Wednesday , 19 : 30 .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his NF@@ L career .
Detroit und Seattle presented great interest after his move to the United States - and there were many other teams that send en@@ quiries to its impressive training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and coach Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a wise decision .
some coach had for@@ ked Hay@@ es for the rest of the game to the bank as he lost a rum@@ ble when he did the Aus@@ sie Rug@@ by League Convention on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minnesota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula entrusted his husband to his husband and gave Hay@@ es the next opportunity to a P@@ unt @-@ Return , and also in the current game after an injury of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula continues to keep his true face in the dressing unit after the game .
instead of his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team the mill was grinding , he encouraged them .
in his press conference , Tom@@ s@@ ula strengthened Hay@@ den publicly at his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ lo@@ por@@ ter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was encouraged by speci@@ alt@@ e@@ ams coordinator , Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who ri@@ et him to care for his pat@@ rons and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne pat@@ ched on a p@@ unt , which was restored in the first quarter of Minnesota Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the way to which Hay@@ es and his massive Australian carri@@ ages had hop@@ ed for his NF@@ L debut .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field and later told the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could not succeed in his NF@@ L career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a thing that happens now , only around the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ den compared the shar@@ pen@@ er with his Origin made back in 2007 when a pass in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , such as it gave them during the Former Yugoslavia in the 1990s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the way we must move to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free voters &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if As@@ ylum competitors want to so@@ aked , the free voters want to move as soon as possible .
in addition , Ai@@ ligh@@ ters also asked more staff for the administrative mines , who are responsible for asylum . &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seek@@ ers , &quot; said Ai@@ v@@ ger .
the FW survey critic@@ ised that several provinces could not be rig@@ or@@ ously implemented : &quot; we need only uniform standards of federal states . &quot;
&quot; Bayern moves from , others not . &quot;
&quot; we have to be able to accept . &quot;

4 People are killed after police officers attemp@@ ting to shoot mas@@ mig@@ ra@@ ins in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after police , strug@@ gling to demonstrate against the proposed new constitution , ex@@ hum@@ bled against the proposed new constitution .
on Tuesday evening , violence breaks out in the Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi district , about 175 miles west of Kathmandu city .
Bish@@ n@@ u Pr@@ as@@ ad Dh@@ ak@@ al , Head of the District Agency , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside the police station , some of you threw stones and fire @-@ bombs .
M@@ R Dh@@ ak@@ al said , the police have used Tr@@ än@@ st@@ as and then shot into the air before completing rubber .
polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it wasn &apos;t immediately clear why the applied rubber covers , of which it is known that they can kill as a less dead@@ ly alternative , evi@@ d@@ ently produced a high death rate .
the conflict was the last in weeks of non@@ violent history in Nep@@ al@@ esi , where members of the ethnic group of Mad@@ h@@ esi say the new provinces , which are formed in the context of the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence .
there was also protests in the Western Nepal from the ethnic group of Sub@@ arus that wants to create a state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent actions since the 10 .
in August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country in provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversi@@ al topic in Nepal , which has been devastating for centuries .
the work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008 , but the legisl@@ ator had accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legisl@@ ature must vote for certain cl@@ auses in the constitutional bill in Kathmandu , and leaders said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .

now there are plans for a new holiday housing at the little sea close to Em@@ den on the table .
the Inter@@ est@@ ing , the middle sized company &quot; System Construction , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the City Development Committee of the Em@@ den Council .
originally this point was based on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under pressure from the H@@ DP Group , and the F@@ DP Group , preparing to investors and the administration intelligence business , Ralf Behr@@ is departed from the system &apos;s construction management in the offensive : &quot; we haven &apos;t added any answer to all questions , &quot; he said before the members of the members and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to meet all rum@@ ors now .
the project has held around ten to twelve million Euros since months in the discussion .
violent reactions under the bu@@ ckets provided to the meeting in the session called the pictures and new details about the desired hotel building .
Roberto Schulz , Meer@@ bu@@ den@@ owner and member of the advoc@@ acy of the tra@@ ilers , Pro H@@ ieve , pro@@ claim : &quot; this is a giant cl@@ ot@@ z , that prot@@ ru@@ ction all other nations . &quot;
in addition , he fears about several other project critics , that traffic through the intended amount of the system would be greatly missed : &quot; there must be whole bus charges so that it &apos;s worth , &quot; says Schulz
but what exactly is happening on what a hectare estate is happening in the former restaurant , but is still open .
there is no operators yet .
&quot; first we have to have a striking concept , &quot; says Ralf Behr@@ ens .
because this still missing , the development plans could be further variable .

instead of a manager , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google co @-@ employee , who fled with her family from Kabul , wrote her personal experiences with her family from Kabul , she was seven years old .

donations go to four non @-@ profit organizations that provide help for refugees and migrants : doctors without Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Google said that the first global donations will be doubled up to a value of 5,5 million to be doubled to $ 11 million . &quot; &quot; &quot;

for easily over@@ overweight diabet@@ ics may be helpful to weight loss surgery .
methods of weight loss surgery for slightly over@@ overweight people with type 2 diabetes , after a new study can last for at least five years .
it is still too early to say if easily overweight people with diabetes in weight loss surgery are longer than those who received non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of weight loss formul@@ as who wrote a mission to the new study in j@@ ama .
weight loss treatment or Adi@@ pos@@ itas surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
you reduce famine and limit the body &apos;s own ability to absorb food .
over the years , adi@@ pos@@ itas concern could be treated as efficiently for the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most of the studies have been carried out in people who are ob@@ ese ob@@ ese with a Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ( BMI ) of 35 or higher .
BMI , a certain measure of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BMI of 25 or more shows that som@@ eb@@ ody is overweight , and people with a BMI over 30 are regarded as ob@@ ese .
you can download your BMI here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , researchers from Tai@@ slo@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital dates that they have been gathered in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obes@@ ity - stomach b@@ ypass and stomach @-@ b@@ anners - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily overweight .
the average BMI among those who underwent surgery declined from 31 to 2@@ 4.5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
the BMI in those who do not have non @-@ surgical treatment procedures were approximately at 29 .
among those who subjected to a surgical procedure , the diabetes condition dis@@ band@@ ed at 36 % , and in some 28 % of them .
in the medical @-@ treated group , diabetes slow@@ ed only by only 2 percent in comparison with the diabetes .
in addition , the results were obtained in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ des and the bad &quot; LD@@ L cholesterol &quot; in general in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , &quot; found the authors .
the researchers also monitored the patient level of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects blood sugar values throughout the time .
hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best documented under 7 percent , the researchers write .
after surgery the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level declined by around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at about 8 percent .
but this better &quot; glyc@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as demonstrated in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not decrease the mortality rate in five years , the conduc@@ tive researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also represents an average annual results for the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year the b@@ ypass tube group had lost more weight compared to the Gast@@ on retin@@ ot@@ omy ( 7.4 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) and ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded a complete overhau@@ l of the diabetes ( 4@@ 6.9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study did not show a survival benefit from surgery after five years , there are indications of a study of heavy people in Sweden that surgery lead to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , it was subjected to ob@@ ese people who underwent a obes@@ ity surgery , 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group of conventional methods .
although the new study did not benefit the survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone , it was a relaxing for persons with a BMI under 35 , which are interested in the proceedings .
&quot; this is the critical point of this study since it says that this operation is lower in this lower BMI group , &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said .
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should begin to take weight as soon as the patient lies with its BMI between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we are waiting for long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; she said .
I think once they have collected these genetic changes , which have been associated with obes@@ ity and diabetes , an in@@ version is really hard . &quot;
love story takes place in the H@@ uns@@ r@@ ück
it is a theme that at present in the Bestseller of Fiction takes place : a young woman , too fast and un@@ mist@@ ak@@ able , meets the pain of her youth again after years , and who loves to love them in her .
thus in the recently published novel &quot; Su@@ it@@ efully we are not so &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der .
beyond the love story , the novel could be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ back readers , because he plays in Lang@@ we@@ iler and the surrounding settlements .

&quot; it is impossible for anyone to come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
Europe cannot receive all refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East would fly .
the Tibetan Buddh@@ ist leaders asked for an end to end violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama thought the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the beginning of his ten days visit to the United Kingdom during his speech on the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford which is dedicated to Eth@@ ics studies .
he required that in the circumstances the interests of humanity in the interests of the individual nations or even continents should be applied .
he also stressed that the reaction of the Western European countries would be ad@@ mi@@ red on the refugee crisis in the refugee crisis , but the situation isn &apos;t reas@@ onably complete .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even though the Dalai Lama in Germany and Austria efforts there was in favour of the crisis , he stressed that it is only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousand refugees , is wonderful but in the meantime , you have to re@@ thinking about long term solutions , like a real peace and genuine development , mainly by education , for these Muslim countries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ultimately , we must think about how the killing in their lands is decreased .
we have to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the application of violence has never resolved these problems &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama thought the problem of violence and commented George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack of September 11 and issued out that the violent reaction of the US moved a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I made my supplement in a letter to President Bush , and I said to him , the way to solve this problem is in non@@ violence .
&quot; I know , his moti@@ fs were good , but He instit@@ uted violence , and that has caused unexpected consequences , &quot; said the Dalai Lama .
quadru@@ ple increase of wareh@@ ous@@ and disinfection by children in the past 4 years
po@@ ison control centers in the United States have a nearly 400 percent increase in the number of children under the age of twelve , causing any alcoholic in action , such as Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord , L@@ op@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , has increased the cases of action of action detection over children under 12 years of age that report plaster control centres , from 3,@@ 266 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; children are increasingly being used for these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go in the emergency , &quot; said L@@ op@@ ez CN@@ N .
he said that some children of disinfect@@ ant inten@@ tionally drunk while some of them do to im@@ press their friends or for a mut@@ ing with the social media .
videos on YouTube show , such as young disinfect@@ ant drink only because of a budget experience .
yo@@ ungst@@ ers have supp@@ os@@ edly mixed disinfect@@ ant with soft mou@@ th@@ wash water to obtain a har@@ der drink .
younger children can be charged with attractive sc@@ ents of disinfect@@ ant .
&quot; a child doesn &apos;t think that this is bad for it , &quot; said L@@ op@@ ez .
many of the more attractive ( hand @-@ disinfect@@ ant ) are those that are par@@ ked .
there are disinfect@@ ant with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange peel , which are very attractive for children .
wall @-@ curing agent contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
particularly with small children , a few spl@@ ashes of water can lead to alcohol in@@ tox@@ ication .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gi@@ ft@@ ist &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hospital at the University of Kansas , the Fox 4 in Kan@@ sa City . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , you would have no cu@@ ck@@ oo whis@@ ky over , but humans leave this hand disinfect@@ ant in reach of children , and when children come to it , then it is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ ja Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , which recently had four syr@@ ing@@ es from after straw@@ berry du@@ cks in school , was brought into an emergency recovery .
her blood @-@ alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold that has been paid by law during an adult , Dr. Chris R@@ it@@ ch@@ ey said , a emergency doctor , who changed it to the G@@ win@@ net Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ ja crashed her words and was not able to go out when she arrived in the emergency .
doctors super@@ vised it over night in a separate children &apos;s Hospital on the signs of Hir@@ n @-@ Trau@@ ma , since the girl had fallen by the alcohol and fell down his head , R@@ it@@ ch@@ ey said .
&quot; this was very anxi@@ ous , &quot; said Ort@@ oria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ ahu &apos;s mother , CN@@ N .
it would have fatal for my child .
L@@ op@@ ez is advised to use their parents and teachers , non @-@ alcohol @-@ free products or disinfection products outside the reach of the child .
some disinfect@@ ant were related to death in@@ tox@@ ication by po@@ is@@ oning .
in 2013 two women died in Ontario , after sl@@ u@@ cking in Ontario , and in Ontario , for a toxic , non @-@ declared access .
employees of health authorities avo@@ ids that Me@@ ethanol no contained a le@@ thal solution instead of ethylene alcohol that was listed as active substance .
in January , three students of the fourth class in New York State made their &quot; female teacher since &quot; reducing anti@@ bacterial products around the class@@ room as a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic against suspension and utterly destroyed them from their space .

I don &apos;t think we will feel under pressure , I think that the players are looking forward .
the lack of title competition in Scottish football - de Bo@@ er
the former ranking tennis player and former national@@ ist League , Ronald De Bo@@ er , said that Dutch soccer fans have lost interest in Cel@@ tic , there is no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the Rang@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently a ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they show no highlights from the Cel@@ tic play anymore and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is because the Rang@@ ers are not there .
people don &apos;t just talk about the return of the Rang@@ ers .
talk about the Old Fir@@ m .
they speak with both teams and this is what they are interested .
there is a lot of voltage in the old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and there are not only the people in Scotland who want to watch these games .
I will turn the things around , swe@@ ars D@@ eil@@ a .
R@@ onn@@ y D@@ eil@@ a accepts that Cel@@ tic must fight , but the Norwegian chief s@@ ware to deal with things .
after the defeat against Malmö and the following retirement from the Champions League , the defeat against a 10 @-@ man from Aberdeen , now with five point lead is clear at the top of the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ eil@@ a said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cel@@ tic had already bad times , and we will come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to come back as soon as possible .
I know , it is very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry , or sad about what happens .
we feel that right - but we will go on .
we really need the support of Cel@@ tic because that makes the player better .
now it &apos;s important to summar@@ ize .
War@@ bur@@ ton c@@ auti@@ ously with January transfers

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a Derby , and it was added to the heat of the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is certainly to say that I am not return to Ty@@ ne@@ yland , when it doesn &apos;t play for Cel@@ tic Glasgow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while it comes up in the United Kingdom in total .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged in the period from May to July with 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without working for the United Kingdom had risen to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
the Scotland &apos;s unemployment quota of 5.9 percent was over half of the 5.5 per cent increase , according to the figures of the National Statistics ( for ONS ) .
in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell to 12,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now 2,@@ 6@@ 12.000 .
employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent in the course of the quarter - a figure on the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
the State Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest numbers and said : &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government laid the foundation stone for a stronger business . &quot;
it is nearly a year ago that Scotland has made the historic decision to stay part of the United Kingdom .
in these 12 months , we have experienced additional improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and unemployment .

why would I be a execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
something later , except for a late legal intervention , I will look on how a man is brought to death .
when it happens , and I hope that it happens , I will sit in a viewer gallery in the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , if Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is ex@@ er@@ ted by the tox@@ ins .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
the invitation took place already in January over his best friend for the first time , and although I sho@@ cked , I voted .
when the day was closer , I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; so I thought , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the entire story about the death penalty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would offer a unique perspective .
there is true that journalists are allowed to see repor@@ table in the USA , and since often more applications are available as places available , there will be a ma@@ ke@@ en lot@@ tery to decide who is chosen .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
who is selected , he will be watching and emotional .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps next friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with telephone data and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh at many if we speak .
the prison authorities say that I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen in order to record what I see .
I just have to try to remind me of all of the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me of acc@@ us@@ ation me on Twitter , my im@@ parti@@ ality .
this is the lesson .
tell us the story of the prisoner , how he wants it and you will get access .
I compl@@ ained with her .
they dre@@ amed that &quot; it could have been better . &quot; but it still doesn &apos;t think that &apos;s wrong what I do .
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had problem with some of the things I said and written .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I would not do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove myself from his list of witnesses .
but he wants us to present an international repor@@ ter there in order to write there .
when he dies , he th@@ inks that the public relations work for the death penalty will help .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a repor@@ ter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will be sitting next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please hear the po@@ d@@ casts that I have made .
I don &apos;t want to enter here again on all details .
I can &apos;t say with security that Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assassination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese are deb@@ ated to be a conc@@ up@@ per@@ ate of the fact .
but I believe that a strong probability is that it is not guilty of mur@@ ders .
I believe that there are not enough evidence to justi@@ fy a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is false .
and from that perspective , I will see him die .
I can &apos;t claim that really objective .
there will be other repor@@ ters where you can turn to it .
what you can get from me , what means it means to die a man un@@ necessary deaths .

Peter Moody claims that st@@ ew@@ ards tried to stop him and thre@@ aten to end the racing sport
Peter Moody claimed that the st@@ ew@@ ards of Racing Victoria tried to install a sp@@ y in his st@@ ables in the past year and threatened to end the race immediately .
he aimed at the st@@ ew@@ ards and the Integration Department of Racing Victoria and claimed that she held a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate Sc@@ rat@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment , the last Stro@@ h@@ hal@@ m on Wednesday .
today , Fair@@ fax Media said that he is always trying to do what is best for racing , and he himself found even under difficult conditions than it went on to explain the positive co@@ b@@ alt @-@ alt rehear@@ sal with Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain .
he had kept 18 months because of the sp@@ y @-@ alleg@@ ations and didn &apos;t want to see it as too high @-@ hanging grapes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say nothing , and I have eaten on it , but sometimes you are fru@@ str@@ ated that everything was coming out once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it is far .
sometimes it re@@ acts , and one must live with the consequences , and I have to live what I said .
today I will go home and well sleeping .
I want to have turned up@@ side down , and I would like that my owner think that I try my best for them .
if they do not think , I do not do that , then I should not be any more trainer .
I need to consider what I do with my license .
in the previous year , Moody had reached the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com , that the integration department tried to express his stall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eigh@@ teen months Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart in a room with a man - which I will be asked to give him a job in my st@@ ables , to give information about what I do in my st@@ alls , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to Rac@@ ing.com . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they obviously believe that I am an che@@ at .
if that is the case , they will surely re@@ comp@@ ile their n@@ oses , because she &apos;s in an attempt to handle me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former chairman of Route L , David Moo@@ g , reig@@ ning President of Route L and Bernard Sa@@ isons , current CEO of Route L , were aware of that time and are still today .
should I bring it to the view that it is personally ?
does Route L &apos;s true behavior and are perhaps people outside of train@@ ers responsible for what is going to do in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
perhaps the people think that I am there .
perhaps they have to take my license and I will drive me and I don &apos;t have any doub@@ ts that what I say it is thinking about it now .
but I am now at the point where the matter is , and that makes me sad .
that makes me really sad .
I will execute the print on it and push it to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the fru@@ str@@ ations levels of the trainer have built up with the long @-@ lasting co@@ b@@ alt examination at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate Sc@@ rat@@ ching led to him that he could &quot; cast his license over the table . &quot;
Moody , best known for its preparation of the un@@ eliminated master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , the racing treatment rule is ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous &quot; after a pack of mud or clay to the horse @-@ debate has been w@@ asted against the rules of race .
&quot; it is against the rules of racing sports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I must take over the full responsibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of my staff has swal@@ lowed up mud to the leg .
it could have been so yesterday evening .
it would have been such a day yesterday , so that was the case .
but it had so on the race day .
Moody , one could con@@ fron@@ ted with a three @-@ month Dis@@ qualification for the treatment with a package at the race day . a study to this matter has been opened .
it is a joke .
people who make these rules do not know about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules but here you go to far , &quot; said Moody .

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy decided to fight against ri@@ vals due to claim claims
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy named criticism of the Tac@@ ian player as &quot; Agenda @-@ Set@@ ting &quot; by two Premier League Favor@@ ites on the N@@ RL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sydney Roo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the arbit@@ rator drawn the Twister players &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ring fight &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with his team in the qualifying finals in Sydney on Friday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Brisbane Bron@@ co &apos;s coach Wayne Bennett made a little face to the Storm team , after his team had made the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land C@@ ow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; model example &quot; the Rug@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in the rings .
Bell@@ amy def@@ ended the tor@@ so @-@ mate of his team and said that they can be concentr@@ ating solely on their &quot; contacts . &quot;
Bell@@ amy added that the cr@@ iti@@ que of two leading coach at his crew was confident to agree with it , since it might be wor@@ ried that they were wor@@ ried about the Storm team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it dives again - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson talked about the fight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to us 24 : 2 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we have changed our contact with our def@@ ensive system or techniques . but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ kl@@ es on a real focus , and that &apos;s the turn@@ around for us .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train . he probably is probably not used to lose , so it was a bit of shock for him .
it is funny as it emerg@@ es for the time of the season .
Bell@@ amy had directed the idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; from his &quot; exciting football &quot; and his ment@@ or remember that Benn@@ inger St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons will win the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; long we@@ arer . &quot;
Wayne speaks of exciting football .
he was compared with our Friday evening on Friday evening and as exciting as her play was , &quot; Bell@@ amy said .
I remember the year 2010 in St George as a bor@@ ing team , and Wayne said that he will take care of a she@@ ath .
but now he &apos;s a team that can play and experience this as exciting , in particular his young players with their speed .
that &apos;s the ball game you &apos;d like to play this type of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants us to play all his kind of football - not any team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt , so that they can play like these .
I build more confidence because they say these things , because they are a bit concerned against us to play against us .
six weeks ago , they probably did not think of us when it went round about the Big Games .
Bell@@ amy pointed out that the game Storm against Roo@@ sters had a higher score than the game Bron@@ co against C@@ ow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ co was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts at our game , but is it an exciting game ?
or are breaks and do not have any points of the cl@@ auses ?
for me it is the blu@@ epr@@ ints .
when you mention each one , it means that we are going to meet in a phase .
the Storm team has free this weekend as they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land C@@ ow@@ boys or C@@ ron@@ ut@@ la Shar@@ ks at the next Saturday night in the semi@@ final in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin from next service morning .
Serbia with $ 200,000 deposit on drug hanging
a man who may seem to be a li@@ fel@@ ong sentence due to his su@@ cess@@ ation , owned by 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , which were re@@ leg@@ alized after Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a damage deposit of $ 200,000 .
Marko Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America via V@@ anu@@ at@@ u and placed in August in Co@@ du@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed , as he first met his co @-@ accused in the morning and later in the Café Co@@ du@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite a possibly life penalty for the attempt to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , argu@@ ed the advoc@@ ate of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the entire quantity and could have been in the Café from a harm@@ less reason .
the judge at the High Court of Justice , Peter Flan@@ agan was concerned about the danger of a river of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he declared the court on Wednesday .
he was related to the police on his position .
Mak@@ si@@ mov@@ o &apos;s mother and boots had a security deposit of $ 200,000 required as security in order to reach its release .
&quot; after reading the ei@@ des@@ er@@ ful explanations of the two people it is clear that the edition of a security of 200,000 dollars represents a real financial burden , &quot; said Judge Flanders .
but this alone will not be sufficient to do it , not to appear on him , he war@@ ned .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released on b@@ ail in prison under the terms that he returns to his Australian and Serbian Pass , taking a daily basis at 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .

towing in small border trans@@ itions to Germany
increasingly more refugees become seized away from the Grand @-@ Austrian border on the German @-@ Austrian border .
many tugs made of fear of discovery and strength of people increases in smaller border cross@@ ings

following the introduction of controls in the German @-@ Austrian border on Tuesday , 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the city .
Stuttgart : runner @-@ up of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; in the South@@ west
Meteor@@ ologists war@@ ks in front of the fall @-@ west in the South@@ west of Wednesday afternoon .
because of a deep pres@@ sur@@ ised water over Western Europe , warm marine air into the country was divided into the German weather service ( D@@ WD ) in Stuttgart .
the powerful t@@ allest is the runner @-@ up of the &quot; Henry &quot; , who was caught up in the Atlantic ocean from the Bermuda Tri@@ angle over the last days .
severe stor@@ ms and thunder@@ storm are mostly expected in Baden .
according to D@@ WD , it is even until Thursday morning , even in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and the ground floor with ar@@ ches of 60 to 90 kilometers per hour .
on Friday , the sun is again exposed to the sun for longer .
the mass makes it : almost every two years , the high@@ ways show their novel@@ ties at the IAA .
in 2015 , especially for the compact car , it is especially advis@@ able to sell themselves especially well .
in addition , cars from the compact class are especially required : approximately 28@@ .1 percent of new registrations were accounted for by the Swiss Federal Office ( KBA ) alone in August .
this is also reflected at the IAA ( Audi@@ ence stage from September 17 to September 27 ) .
between all the fut@@ ur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars , many new compact models are presented in this year .
one of the biggest premier@@ es for the German automobile industry is the Opel Astra that will stand at deal@@ er@@ ships in autumn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Astra is an extremely important model , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Opel Group Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is the nu@@ cle@@ us of the brand .
the volume model should also be well sold , but the new Astra is not to be more expensive .
Opel makes a start @-@ up of the biggest compet@@ itor Volkswagen Golf in prosp@@ ect , starting at € 17 650 .
the current Astra only costs Euro 16 990 .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the H@@ esse offer additional diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , including three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines .
different than the most important competitors , VW Golf and Ford Focus indicates the Opel Astra as five @-@ door .
the second version will follow in the spring of the com@@ bi which is already visible at the IAA .
and what about the Astra at the IAA I have driven to new compact cars ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra Compet@@ itors to the race .
at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is exclusively available for a five @-@ door in a conventional and a distinc@@ tly athlet@@ ic GT version .
in the trade he comes to the beginning of next year , then also as a com@@ bi .
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan off@@ shoot wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment with the new model .
the compact Infin@@ iti with its curved lines adap@@ ts to the design line of the brand .
the basic model will receive a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
but in the offer also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp are also available .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , who is celebrating its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
the manufacturer &apos;s maximum torque is 170 Newton metres ( Nm ) .
the start of sales of the Bal@@ eno park in Europe is in spring 2016 .
DS 4 : not brand new but all @-@ round is the compact class DS 4 , which is available at the IAA .
outside , the designer of the noble mounting plate in front of all hand on the front part : here , the radiator gr@@ ille was newly painted and the changed head@@ lights are equipped with LED technology .
the interior has been moderni@@ zed especially the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system , reduced the number of buttons by a touch screen and for the first time Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play .
at the IAA in the compact class , there are also a series of over@@ work@@ ings and new versions like the Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 308 GT@@ I .
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters of cells are human un@@ worthy
the Federal Constitutional Court has abandoned an ex @-@ in@@ mate of the jurisdiction of Te@@ gel which was accommodated in a small cell for months in months .
because of the violation of the human dig@@ nity , prisoners are generally entitled to financial compensation if they are accommodated in small cells .
this decision made decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision on Wednesday .
the suffer@@ ers can also hope to trust even if they were imprisoned only a few days in the narrow spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
in order to have been an ex @-@ in@@ mate with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe : he was accommodated in a single cell with around five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was dre@@ amed .
after that , the man , who has meanwhile res@@ ume according to his an@@ ov@@ ts again , was transferred to a larger cell in one time .
his term liability for def@@ amation claims against the country in Berlin failed .
but the constitutional rec@@ ti@@ ers took up the verdict of the Berlin Chamber of the Berlin Chamber and turned the case there again .
they are demonstr@@ ating the crowd of men .
Chamber of Chamber now decides about the amount of compensation
even if the period of legal reasons may be relevant for the compensation period only a few days of detention for the compensation , a compensation was given to it .
otherwise , &quot; a cur@@ v@@ ature of the right protection of personality is to be feared . &quot;
the Chamber II must now clari@@ fy the amount of money damage .
the constitu@@ ents have often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past .
they only said in April of a det@@ ain@@ ee of damages , because he was imprisoned naked in one cell .
human rights is according to a decision by 2011 , also the multiple allocation of a cell without separate toilet .
Moreover , in addition , on Wednesday , in November 2009 , the Constitutional Court confirmed a de@@ cent accommodation that had been confirmed on a parallel strike in Berlin in November 2009 .
the then pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs escaped three months away from 15 to 21 hours , in such a cell as in the Kar@@ st case .
the Berlin pris@@ ons had come to the head@@ lines in recent weeks due to lack of staff .
prisoners are therefore kept for 23 hours , and the aggressi@@ vity appears to be ra@@ ged , even due to the un@@ claimed situation .
according to the Ministry of Justice 21 places in Te@@ gel for young talent cont@@ ests were not occupied , 19 will drop off in 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we are creating the &quot;
the immig@@ ration of refugees is a huge challenge - the ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or is determined to take her .
what comes to Germany ?
about 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers are to come to Germany after the forecasts of the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs , according to the statement of Vi@@ enn@@ anz@@ ler Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is capable of accept@@ ing one million refugees .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) demonstrated in view of the unusual challenging challenge : &quot; I say again and again : we can do this , and we create it . &quot;
what comes to Germany gives the following overview .
used according to diverse forecasts between 3@@ 50000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs ) and 400@@ 000 ( estimate of the Pest@@ el Institute ) Apartments annually - and for the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as has been build ( 25@@ 0000 apartments ) .
distur@@ bing is the lack of living space but above all paid rental objects : every year 600@@ 00 to 800@@ 00 social dwellings from the rental price pl@@ under@@ ed , and in order to apply these especially favorable housing , refugees will also apply to refugees too .
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) , therefore aims to double the funding from 4@@ 518 million to one billion euros .
much too little is that from the point of view of the Pest@@ el Institute : 80 000 social dwellings per year would have to be prepared , and this would have to invest € 6.4 billion per year .
scientists and Federal Minister for this purpose , scientists and states are also planning to give more tax advantages for investments in the housing .
according to estimates of the institute for labor market and professional research , 55 percent of the poultry farmers will be employed in Germany in the long term .
however , refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked after their qualification , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann @-@ Foundation .
however , for the integration of refugees , but is crucial if they find jobs in Germany .
work is the key to social contacts , for the appreci@@ ation in the admission of the admission of immig@@ rants , but also for self @-@ est@@ e@@ em of immig@@ rants , says Mig@@ r@@ ations@@ for@@ scher Dietrich Thr@@ ill@@ hardt .
in Germany , according to Thr@@ issu@@ hardt , a political turn@@ around was given for the recognition of work for refugees .
while there was an employment ban for asylum seek@@ ers from up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , just like the resi@@ den@@ ier , the asylum seek@@ ers to a residence .
in society , the company also decided - because of the expert meeting - mostly through sight , that it should be facilit@@ ated the access to the labour market .
some great hur@@ dle for access to the labour market are missing in German .
so far there is no sufficient supply to general and occupational @-@ based voice lessons .
research shows that jobs are most widely used by personal contacts .
the construction of networks is therefore according to the view of Thr@@ än@@ hardt on the Royal Path for the re@@ integration .
the Berlin School of School has found that only a few vol@@ at@@ ile parents can give their children to the day@@ car@@ es , an estimated 10 to 15 percent : &quot; for the root @-@ root parents it &apos;s only important to summar@@ ize the family , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ cher , spokes@@ man for youth and family in the Berlin Senate department .
to make the family nonetheless convince the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration was distributed in different languages .
if the demand of educ@@ ators increased strongly through the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would attempt to increase its training capacity - by increasing more professional colle@@ ges .
students with no German language skills are prepared for classes in the countries .
they are not always taught by trained teachers and teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers , who only have one qualification in German as a two @-@ language .
there is no lack of evidence , &quot; Be@@ ate tells us from the Berlin School of school .
the German student works estimates that about 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany .
in principle , no Bundes@@ land asylum seek@@ ers or commem@@ oration of the study - the only exception to date has been Berlin , Wi@@ ens@@ en@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CDU ) but now abandoned his position .
study authorization could be facilit@@ ated by the access to the university .
because refugees with a dwelling running or Dul@@ ce are given no performances after the asylum seek@@ ers Act , when they start a study .
the latter did not have any b@@ af@@ o@@ gram@@ mes , as they fall under the b@@ ann@@ ins @-@ legal persons inside the category .
Ged@@ ted refugees have had lived for four years in Germany so far to be eligible to be B@@ af@@ ö@@ g @-@ entitled , from 1 January 2016 to 15 months .
and these funding gap must also be closed , Steffen Schröder , Berlin@@ s State Secretary for Science , and the German Karlsruhe student union .
the students should get b@@ af@@ ö@@ g at once .
Islam will in future play a more important role , as many refugees are Muslims , and many are the religion important part of their identity .
the state should succ@@ essi@@ vely attend the same rights as they have the churches , and the existing state of churches will continue to develop into a new state religi@@ ons relationship .
it is important to be the establishment of a Islamic welfare Association which car@@ es professional for the new@@ com@@ ers .
at the right hand include duties .
thus , the representatives of Islam have to contact clear contact with some and ready to gather together with the state in many fields and to prepare certain control possibilities .
this also belongs to the will@@ ing@@ ness to prepare for the grounds of religious fundament@@ alism .
the chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , ou@@ sted on Thursday the concern and religious conflicts could be listed also to Germany .
those who wanted to listen to such conflicts in Germany say &quot; have immediate right to stay here in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk , in Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk , in Germany .
he proposed to translate the Basic Law on arab@@ ic .
integration will be much more than today a theme by the whole society .
thus the majority society has to change , the dis@@ solution of discrimination and rac@@ ism is ur@@ gent .
indeed , Germany - as a result of europ@@ ean decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination agency and a general equilibrium law .
but it is very slow to prove just like the NSU @-@ M@@ ord@@ series , where the police and authorities were systematically igno@@ red the rac@@ ist motif .
the same opportunities for all : what migrants organisations and the interests of the non @-@ white German NGOs require long to demand and to use the international agreement such as the anti @-@ terrorism con@@ dol@@ ences . in the next few years , when the country will remain peaceful and citizens to use their new citizens - to the sole of all .
in general , Germany was able to present medi@@ cally cared for medi@@ cally cared for medi@@ cally , the medical president Frank Ulrich Mont@@ gom@@ ery .
&quot; what Man@@ - Power and Capacities , &quot; we can do that , &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel .
however , extra money must flow into the system .
to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ gom@@ ery is calling for all si@@ bling immediately in the registration of heal@@ th@@ iness .
achievements could later be calculated afterwards with the federal states .
and long term it was highly frag@@ ile , so many people with the limited power catalogue to look at the applic@@ ants Act .
otherwise , the doctors make it easy to create the language barri@@ ers .
as far as so far , Berlin &apos;s health scientist the@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that Mig@@ rants has been committed against their diseases as well as other patients .
do not only be paid in clinics , also in medical practices , interpre@@ ting them .
many refugees too have been helping to provide ambul@@ ances in ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic view .
in refugee children , there are clearly more un@@ affected disabilities , and in the yo@@ ungst@@ ers there is a declaration of HIV .
however , Mont@@ gom@@ ery was gu@@ gom@@ ery , however , with some other cases of disease images .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite attack or tuber@@ culosis are not so difficult to recognize &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and as regards the medical angel , he would even suffer relief in sight of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syrians had a highly developed educational system , some refugees are even doctors .
if they must be pract@@ ised , they would have to prove their qualification and are bl@@ ur@@ gent again .
at least half of the refugees arrive in Germany is ill estimates by the Federal College of Psycho@@ therap@@ ist ( B@@ Pt@@ K ) : most of them suffer from trau@@ matic con@@ vol@@ at@@ disorder or depression .
especially in the refugee children , Dietrich Mun@@ z explains , President of the B@@ Pt@@ K .
a recent study published by the TU Munich in Germany proves that every fifth Syrian refugee @-@ man is trau@@ matic in Germany .
whoever has been suffering from a trau@@ matic stress disorder is , among other things to what is called Flash@@ back , breathing , di@@ zz@@ iness , cor@@ di@@ es and death .
other symptoms are sleep and concentration functions , severe wor@@ ries and emotional di@@ ver .
in order to prevent the symptoms of chronic , it was necessary for early treatment , declared Mun@@ z .
yet only four percent of the psych@@ ologically ill refugees get a psycho@@ therapy .
although psych@@ ically ill and asylum seek@@ ers can make a motion for a psycho@@ therapy , but processing usually lasts several months .
in addition , generally workers or doctors who are not trained for mental illness would not be necessary , whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this will cause false ass@@ ess@@ ments , says Mun@@ z .

approximately 80 animals from five different continents are enjoying any string box .

Sim@@ bab@@ we@@ es Robert Mug@@ abe le@@ es false speech in Parliament
in the beginning of the year , M@@ R Mug@@ abe , African leaders , fell down the stairs at the beginning of the year .
it was no hurt , but the video of the Falls spread rapidly through the social media .
the Parliament &apos;s opening was also advised by statements by members of the opposition that they had received anonymous death thre@@ ats and war@@ ned them to accompany the speech by Mr Mug@@ abe with Bu@@ h@@ call .
last month they had been hat@@ ched , and during his speech to the State of the Nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man for the Movement for Democratic Change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) Inno@@ cent gon@@ ese told that seven Opp@@ os@@ itions politicians have received SMS messages on their mobile phones that they were to distur@@ b with Mr. Mug@@ abe .
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but she has the title &apos; death &apos; , &quot; he said to Mug@@ an@@ es . &quot;
they indicate the members of parliament members that the immun@@ ity ends in the parliament and once they leave the parliament , their parliamentary immun@@ ity is no longer effective .

Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard will manufacture up to 30.000 jobs
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard is expected to drop from 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in the framework of restructuring and saving efforts to the company &apos;s services .
in this year , HP will split up into two stock companies , sharing the computer and printer business from his fast @-@ growing company hardware and its service activities .
the expected job reduction will result in a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , HP said in a statement .
&quot; this restructuring measures will be a competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chair@@ woman and Chief Executive , which should lead the unit after the separation .
&quot; Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise is focused on smaller and stronger than it is HP today and we have a wide and deep@@ est portfolio of shops that support companies in transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man .
as an independent company , we are better than ever before to satisfy the changing requirements of our customers around the world .
Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise has more than 50 billion $ annual revenue and &quot; will be focused on the deployment of un@@ managed , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; such a statement by the company .
it divi@@ des a company which was founded in the 1930s by the graduates of the Stan@@ ford University Bill Hew@@ lett and Dave Packard , in order to produce electrical installations and their Palo Alto garage is called &quot; the place of Sil@@ icon Valley . &quot;
hp has a massive restructuring through the turning of traditional computers to mobile devices .
the HP , the second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. high @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this area that is based on the convic@@ tion that a narrow @-@ focused company has better performance .
FC Arsenal @-@ captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team mates remain behind the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the past Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
W@@ enger emphas@@ ised that it was only in September and if his rehabilitation goes after plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere is sure to miss at least the next four games for England and in view of its history , his shar@@ ehol@@ ding in the next summer at the European Championship is certainly not certain .
the great confusion with this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had stopped the last season after a separate key@@ less injury and then returned to his old swing while the pre@@ season .
&quot; this kind of injury is not threatened with care@@ ers , &quot; said W@@ enger .
it is a bone , who healed not good .
this is no longer matter .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his Kn@@ u@@ ck@@ les or with the injuries he had previously .
that may be true from pure medical view but as W@@ enger also recognized , there is the associated danger of other injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an un@@ pleasant pattern .
Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of Ar@@ sen@@ as 157 lig@@ as@@ games in the last five days .
the wider image for Arsenal is that they have been in six out of eight playing times since 2007 / 08 one of the two Premier League clubs , which most vulner@@ able in most vulner@@ abilities .
W@@ enger accepts the potential of a devil &apos;s price , but ar@@ senal believes that there is no improvement in the risk of injury during the last season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , if you return from injury , you have a vulner@@ able period , a time when you must strengthen your body and win combat power , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ enger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabil@@ ises , I am confident that he will do it and he will perform a career of the kind which he deserv@@ es .
Arsenal began his Champions League @-@ season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb before the play against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham hot@@ track on next Wednesday , and W@@ enger is presenting a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ ctor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not travelled to Croatia , which means that Math@@ ieu Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta will probably start .
W@@ enger may also start with K@@ ier@@ to Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ ro@@ ud instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; I tried to hold the balance and the players who need it to gain a small bre@@ ather @-@ break , &quot; said W@@ enger .
although ar@@ senal are clear to go through group F , Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb belongs to the playing places with the biggest registration effect in Europe .
Dynam@@ o is also defeated in 41 games , after the &quot; un@@ defeated &quot; campaign started in the last season .
the stadium was sh@@ aken on Tuesday night , where on the Richter scale 3.2 were measured .
this year it was 10th in Zagreb .
W@@ enger is the opinion that Arsenal won the teaching of the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and remains committed by far hope to lead the association with his first European ok@@ al triumph .
&quot; this drive is immen@@ sely , &quot; said W@@ enger .
it has never been folded in Arsenal .
we were very close in 2006 but on the other side I &apos;m too long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
friendship : the com@@ edy show , which awarded us serious lessons on male friends
the lack of similar represent@@ ations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how to open the need for men , now more des@@ per@@ ate than ever before , such as self @-@ murder among young men on a 15 @-@ year @-@ high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains for three times more common in men than women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , the Campaign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ta ( CA@@ LM - campaign against a her@@ ed@@ itary life ) declared as the year of the man with the aim of asking the culture in question , to seek help , if they need them .
friendship is the heart of the heart to master this challenge .
a recent study with more than 2,000 high @-@ school students with de@@ press@@ ant symptoms determined that , when a suff@@ erer had a suff@@ ici@@ ently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery are doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally re@@ healthy people hal@@ ved the risk of mental problems .
but of course you have to have some friends so that a friendship may function .
in the age of social media and communic@@ ating with emphasis on substance , the in@@ ability of the answer is often more important than an important contact .
our digital life have the need to appear , strong , fun and successful , doubles , even though the isolation is dominant .
this su@@ perf@@ icial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists ex@@ tr@@ ins@@ ist values . money , image , social status , all of in@@ tr@@ ins@@ ic values - our internal lon@@ ging for personal development and friendship which affects our spiritual health much more deeply @-@ w@@ ender .
and like a vide@@ og@@ ame @-@ inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire , &quot; money can &apos;t really buy luck .
the beauty of friends was that this focus was on the head .
every character was not defined by his work , but by his personality , it sh@@ one by the interaction as a friend .
the hum@@ or of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent h@@ ugs , Mom@@ ents for football player in cozy sh@@ ackl@@ es and those looking for Ross to Rachel - all that came out of knowing that men can get back on every case , even though they often return to explore fully their feelings .
as a staff of the phone past@@ oral care told me , ... &quot; my in@@ audi@@ ble role for people who are de@@ pres@@ sive and self @-@ end@@ anger@@ ed , has shown myself clearly in how even the smallest inter@@ actions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us feel often not able to talk with friends .
the old mak@@ eup , &quot; I come with it &quot; has a tremendous impact , feeling the feeling that it is perceived as weakness started when you speak about problems . &quot;
friends is one of the shows that seem to me in the sense when I try to offer long @-@ term development of action .
it clearly presents the little moments of men &apos;s friends .
so very my objective outer side status on the phone to help people in eye views of desp@@ air also may help , long term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you meet this weekend com@@ edy Central Friend@@ ship with the celebration of the day completely re@@ arranged back@@ drop , why do not take your friends at a drink at Central Peru .
or , even better if you see in Star@@ bu@@ cks anyone alone , give him a smile and you can say hello .
you never know what could make your friendship .
friends is broadcast on com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the entire 236 episodes - for # Friend@@ ship Fest
di Maria hits to help PS@@ G to compos@@ e Mal@@ y
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ i@@ di and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani for his trip to Malmö .
di Maria meets his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to move to Malmö .
here are the review and the response to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held a course when Paris Saint @-@ Germain commenced his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malmö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park stadium on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player who brought the French champion to the track , but afterwards they missed a number of opportunities , before they finally increased their advantage as Cav@@ ani in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Sch@@ acht@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk the group A needs a strong start against the Swedish masters , since they will not only aim for the K.@@ O@@ .-@@ rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter @-@ fin@@ alist in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a class of Laurent Blan@@ cs Team at Z@@ lat@@ an Ibra@@ him@@ ov@@ ics . he became later in play against his home @-@ home team and against the club , with whom he started his lively career in 1999 .
&quot; it is not easy to win at home or out in the Champions League . therefore it &apos;s a good start to create and relaxed problems , even if there are certain things we need to perf@@ ecting in the course of the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; this is a good sign .
we wanted to win and we won , although I am sorry that we were not one or two further gates . &quot;
Ibra@@ him@@ ovic returned to his injury in one of three amendments to the Paris team , which could last a 2 : 2 Un@@ decided to keep his own place against Bordeaux in the first league , but was sent out in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
the Argentin@@ ian wing forward was referred to as man , the PS@@ G was taken to the next level in Europe , and he noticed him why , when he entered into Marco Ver@@ r@@ att@@ is Pass behind the Malmö opposite , before he finished in Johan Wil@@ and in the long corner of the multilingual network .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if anyone believed that PS@@ G &apos;d been a great victory , he was disappointed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Malmö , the Cel@@ tic in an play @-@ off proposed to achieve this level , took part in the field at An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was rounded up with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle area is a serious opponent .
but with a shot by Nikola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic who arrived far from Kevin Tra@@ pps &apos;s post in the 34@@ th minute , they gave little about attack .
instead , PS@@ G itself was sometimes related , with some mis@@ sil@@ es and bad degrees , not least by Es@@ him@@ ovic , who was first pat@@ ched in the first half , and then abandoned , after Cav@@ ani had used it after the re@@ boot .
nevertheless he did much more so@@ unding when he brought his fellow player into the game , and it was a pass by him@@ him@@ ovic , who was named after Maria in a shooting down by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the P@@ fo@@ sten ...
the second gate finally came shortly after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ ans had therefore scored his sixth stop , after launching a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
that finished all thoughts that Malmö come back to the game but only an excellent intervention of wild and from shortest distance to help David Lu@@ iz , could keep the final result low before the replacement player E@@ ze@@ qui@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi was recognized by the end .
the coach of Malmö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later reported that PS@@ G played a class in his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last December last year .
since then we have only played the same level in the Swedish league , which did not have the same level .
the Quali@@ fications are not enough . &quot;
hat above Paris !
it was a great play of them !

during a sequence of Sunday night by H@@ BO@@ s Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown was stressed than this the need of alternative perspectives and in terms of a black prot@@ agon@@ ists in the chosen project of the project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we talk about diversity , then do the occupation of the film and not with the occupation of the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; insured Dam@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Brown re@@ acted , re@@ acted to un@@ discovered un@@ belief and called &quot; HO@@ O ! Wow . okay , &quot; when the comments of the actor from The Mar@@ ti@@ an decided .
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the industry @-@ based Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly Brothers in order to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to do people who think about it - who can always be the director - as it was the figure of the Harmony , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only black person , and it is a N@@ ut@@ te , beaten up by its white ro@@ v@@ age .

&quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders .
recently , it was announced that Dam@@ on was located on a list of Enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le , which are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West .

&apos; American Ninja Warrior &apos; crow@@ ded first champion
professional sport clim@@ b@@ ating Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero was the first Ath@@ let who won the American Ninja Cup on Monday night and took home the Grand Prize of $ 1 million .
the competition Show , which ended their 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who decided to termin@@ ate all stages of his obst@@ acle course .
during the season , two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman went to the finals .
the climbing on a 75 foot long climbing rope belonged to the last task in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten ended his task within the time that he completed the first Ath@@ let , completed the str@@ en@@ uous stage 4 of American Ninja Cup . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero completed the challenge of full three seconds faster than the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! News after the hard fought game , still under the shock at the win of the Grand Prix of 1 Million $ .
&quot; I mean it is amazing to think about it , I have never earned more than 10,000 $ or to life , &quot; said Isaac E ! over his money .
so suddenly I can imagine ... as I can &apos;t imagine ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood repor@@ ter to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , even though he finished first prize at all , did not get any prize money ever .
after the rules the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when there is more than one fin@@ alists , one receives one of the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and changing life , he receives the great greetings .
I don &apos;t think it &apos;s too big about it .
he just has done so happy what he did .
the masses of awards he received by fans .
he is such a great guy and a father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
Ge@@ off said to me : &quot; if I should be beaten by someone , then I &apos;m glad that it is Isaac . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I think they had felt so , when they were mixed up the rolls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
America Ninja Warrior was renewed for a season of season the shooting started in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sk@@ ates on Minnesota Twin@@ s
MIN@@ NE@@ APO@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not very funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
earlier , they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the tiger ranks on the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as Sp@@ o@@ iler , but played this part in the Tuesday perfect against the Minnesota Twin@@ s with 5 @-@ 4 in the target Field .
the Twin@@ s lost a chance to climb up within a game half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card @-@ Platz .
for Detroit , although only for one evening , it was a return of the three letters F @-@ word , which was difficult to hold on a large part of the second half of the season so difficult .
&quot; all victories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers manager Brad P@@ mus .
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Alfredo Simon maintained his early offensive support , while Detroit starts three times in the first two inside , then once in the sixth and then once again in the ninth place .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) defeated 6 R@@ uns 6 times in the 1 / 3 inner ring .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to end this year , &quot; Simon said .
it &apos;s hard to throw in the bul@@ l@@ aces of any game , and therefore I will definitely focus on going into the game .
the designated tiger h@@ itters Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three hit game of Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against the Seattle Navy on July 6th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has w@@ asted the b@@ tw@@ ood well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at ( stroke training ) , saw clearly better from the bul@@ l@@ pillars , and he brought it into the game .
with three Around uns at the end of the seventh inside , the Twin@@ s had their best chance to come back to the game .
center F@@ iel@@ der Byron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished its inning with a double on the left @-@ line field .
the Right F@@ iel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks was a colorful , and Simon brought his second bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ cker to Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the Bla@@ de Hard@@ y left handed .
Hard@@ y super@@ ran wall , the only man that was con@@ fron@@ ted with whom he con@@ fron@@ ted , before the ro@@ g@@ able ro@@ ok@@ ie ch@@ man Miguel S@@ ano , who handed him a Two @-@ Run .
with a pair of runners and the closing @-@ run at the second , closing the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe will become a Double Play .
it was the Major League per@@ formers 27th time in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe will beat a Double Play .
after Detroit added an Insurance run by the end of the ninth inside , the wall guaranteed an R@@ B@@ I double against the add@@ ess of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
the right handed off , however , S@@ ano with three Pit@@ ches for its Fifth Save .
Detroit benef@@ ited from the beginning of the game from a still not mobile Phil Hug@@ hes .
the tig@@ ers realized three R@@ uns in the first two inn@@ ings against the law@@ suit veter@@ an , who had been canc@@ eled before the game by the vulner@@ able more than a month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously not the beginning I w@@ ished myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hug@@ hes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I felt glad when I got down and felt that I would make some good pit@@ ches there in the third In@@ ning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after receiving the first off @-@ off @-@ Bat@@ ter , H@@ ush@@ es gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ chi@@ pper .
a Two @-@ Out Walk in J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought in the game Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z created a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z succeeded with his 0 @-@ 21 success in the Scor@@ ing Position .
the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single at the right side , made an additional run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was cast out of the game when he attempted to go to the third , which was a threat .
the tig@@ ers laid in second place , one of the One @-@ Out Double from Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single from Center @-@ F@@ iel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose to the 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a great blow , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Twin@@ s @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ eur . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he did not sm@@ itten so well , but he did not know the right spot .
Hug@@ hes had been placed in a pitch @-@ Count , with no points in the third inning , before he was replaced by the Reli@@ ever rec@@ essed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ ke@@ .
Hug@@ hes came to three hits with six hits and a walk with four Stri@@ ke@@ outs .
note : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP An@@ i@@ bal San@@ chez was eliminated because of a violation of the roots .
it was investigated by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the shoulder from San@@ chez in 2007 .
S@@ án@@ chez , since the middle of August at the level of injury due to a shoulder voice , should be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ chez from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris is cancelled by the level of injuries to start against the Twin@@ s .

no diet fruit - Mang@@ os contain much sugar
Mang@@ os are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
but whoever desires to eighth to his sl@@ ender line will often not cry out of them .
for Mang@@ os contain relatively much sugar - especially the suc@@ rose .
the exotic fruit are nevertheless healthy : B vitamins , as well as vitamins E and C. vitamins have B vitamins and vitamins E and C. above all , Mang@@ os but much vitamin A and its preliminary beta @-@ car@@ ot@@ in .
those who eat the fruits does not support vision , immune system and met@@ abolic processes in the body .
when buying , Mang@@ os should not be too soft or ste@@ er@@ able and comfortable .
the switching colour only says nothing about it , how ripe the fruit is - so also green Mang@@ os can taste delicious .
they should store at room temperature and be consumed within a few days .
then they taste pure , pure or in sweet dishes .
a man@@ go is also a del@@ ight@@ ful dishes a special note .
it mil@@ ates the slightly bitter taste deficiency such as Chic@@ o@@ ree and Radi@@ c@@ cio .
and a chard , it suits well to fish , poultry , lamb and wild .

Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Square
about 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Square in Rome .
on Wednesday , Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino has been christ@@ ened at the name of the German Re@@ duc@@ ators in the presence of the town of Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino on Wednesday .
in Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , he is now recognized as the &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot;
the park lies in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the name was then filed by the Con@@ sortium of the Protestant Churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , parish priest of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Rome , rec@@ alled that the Protest@@ ants were able to live in the city of the Pop@@ es on centuries .
in a symbolic way , the tradition of Christian faith in Rome is visible in a symbolic way .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was a young August@@ inian mon@@ k at the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 several months in Rome .
he received the city then as a sin @-@ b@@ able .
his negative impressions dates back to Rome according to some hist@@ ori@@ ans in his future fight against Rome .
in Luther in his thes@@ es against the abol@@ ition of the foreign Church , Luther was initiated .
hammer artists invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) Dor@@ n@@ enk@@ rone is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt has painted for its Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which now appeared with magnificent images now .
in the beginning it was the image for Ot@@ mar Alt , who has formulated his personal interpre@@ tations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 designs .
with colourful colours and imagin@@ ative forms , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old has received - what is not even important with &quot; fun &quot; images .
on the contrary : the respective topics can be adjusted , it can work quite well .
for about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his Bible project for which he has made a sub@@ jective artistic collection from the many theme areas of the &quot; Book of all books . &quot;
there are cycles that dev@@ ote themselves on topics such as crosses , pl@@ agues , commandments or pat@@ ern@@ ity .
he led the spont@@ ane@@ ously by several partners : this is true for the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler publishing house with its focus on artwork .
and there is especially the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost who engaged him on the basis of painting with the respective Bible verses .
he interpreted the images from Ot@@ mar Alt selected Bible verses and is now translated into the present context . &quot;
these texts are like verb@@ al mirrors of painting .
they are embedded in between the original Bible stories by Martin Luther and a movement of the artist , who formulated his personal thoughts on the situation here .
the jew@@ ellery band has golden letters .
so the 75 @-@ year @-@ old gives a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high level of in@@ tim@@ acy .
E@@ mot@@ ions were ultimately born trig@@ gers for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , 1940 in W@@ ern@@ ig@@ er@@ ode and raised in Berlin , comes out of a family that belonged to the strict Protestant mist@@ n@@ hu@@ d order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that the up@@ bringing time stands with the floor &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to work with it , perhaps to bear me again with the Lord &apos;s Father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to help you find more opportunities in the quick@@ est time : &quot; the perception of image worlds are dominated by Rek@@ l@@ ame today and that &apos;s no@@ isy .
Symbol@@ ism is ur@@ ged .
artists have different lust and desire to show things .
pictures always have a little secret and are not decorative .
&quot; in this regard , I &apos;m a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt wants to let the viewer expos@@ ures to the images &quot; to let them live , discover and feel what power they have : &quot; the picture ad@@ diction to his counter@@ parts . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost began on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; as always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts art . &quot; I like it , like he lives with his pictures . &quot;
I haven &apos;t already considered the Bible to fully capture the Bible , but also selected for him as mysterious subjects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was no co @-@ operation at eye level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Yahweh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is about the pictures the text here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from Luther @-@ Verlag it is an invitation to find &quot; his life to deep@@ en freedom &quot; and freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ lies pictures speak for M@@ öh@@ ler to both the ( biblical ) language of love and also the responsibility of responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas material - was presented for the first time in an exhibition that will be unveiled on 15 November in Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that this year will happen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;

DF@@ B intensi@@ fied commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B wi@@ dens his commitment to refugees from 2019 , the Bundesliga make a clear indication on the weekend .
the football re@@ acts to ass@@ essing the situation in Germany and sec@@ ures the policy of its assistance during the implementation of the pending problems .
&quot; I have been keeping it for the biggest challenge of our country since the re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody can say nothing , that doesn &apos;t tell me , I have nothing to do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be interested every individual to get this subject in the handle , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B boss Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensi@@ vely .
&quot; I am next Wednesday in the Chancell@@ ery , and meet his State Minister E@@ zo@@ id uz and Chancellor . &quot;
&quot; there will be sure a central role to play a central role , &quot; he announced .
the football could also help and help .
the decisive turn@@ outs have to make the policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German football League has therefore extended its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; beyond the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Stiftung , we have ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; explained Mur@@ s@@ bach at the edge of the UEFA European conference in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
some Bundes@@ li@@ gi@@ sts support this program too .
this weekend the 36 pro@@ bi@@ ver@@ t transl@@ ates a significant sign when they are held on the left of Tri@@ k@@ ot@@ er@@ mel , instead of the usual sponsor@@ ing @-@ name ( Hermes ) to help &quot; We can help # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also want to make clear that all of them should help , where , and how they can only do , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen sports leader Rud@@ i Völ@@ ler of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and recorded the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ intelli@@ gi@@ bility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the refugee drama every one , nobody can go away . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can host the German Federal Armed Forces , no , we need to use our jet power , our influence and our possibilities to help many refugees who have already so incredibly suffered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoff@@ enh@@ ei@@ ms managing director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; famous sign of league . &quot;
for EM quali@@ fier against Hungary on this Friday , the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Saale .
Nier@@ s@@ bach ad@@ mi@@ red the support of refugees as &quot; a large communal plant of German football . &quot;
that all 36 licensed tests would have launched their own projects , be great .
it is also great that small and smallest for@@ ums are active .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which we spent , is living in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; he said .
in this and next year , the association will jointly serve 300 000 euros for the integration of refugees , together with the DF@@ B selection and the Federal Government .

at the accident at the stairs in the house of his brother in the USA he had fallen down to a water @-@ glass , which he carried out in the left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is almost deser@@ ted , was very big to get off to the street - that he tells us , last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ HE &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quotes the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ IW@@ O &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; co @-@ founder Has@@ so Plat@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could cause his work to go out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October we meet to the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said Plat@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old managers at the meeting and &quot; fully able to work . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t qu@@ it in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday issue ) , who will come back to Germany in October and will continue to run the software group .
&quot; I am full for SAP , fully in my job . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , I was of course in contact with the Supervisory Board and its leader Has@@ so Plat@@ ner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t said the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer time he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
it is important to him to go to the public with such a personal history , the manager of the S@@ Z &quot; : &quot; everyone can happen to something . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important is to re@@ sign up again if you like . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

rob@@ ot@@ tos : government wants to become a pione@@ ering role in Germany
Germany shall be on the principle of the Federal Government &apos;s Change of the Master of Techn@@ ological A@@ war@@ ites .
the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a strategy of strategy out of the house of Transport Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which provides investment in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
Do@@ brin@@ dt said on Wednesday in Frankfurt am the edge of the Motor Show IAA of a &quot; new Mobil@@ is@@ sion era . &quot;
the automated and connected driving continue to increase traffic safety and cause less gru@@ elling , Do@@ brin@@ dt said .
he wants to discuss the subject also with his counter@@ part of the G7 states who also joined the industry with representatives of the industry .
the strategy of strategy of the traffic department under@@ lines the importance of the mobile broad@@ band expansion and a spe@@ edy transfer to digital radio stations .
at testing new technology , a test track is currently being launched on the 9 in Bavaria .
in order to ensure the driver &quot; no additional liability risks , &quot; the Federal Government wants to check the legal framework conditions , and where necessary to adapt to the new developments . &quot;
in Germany , Germany plans to ensure that the maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars will be raised from 10 to 130 km / h .
the Federal Government also plans to use a change in the Vienna Convention which previously only provides the people as driver .
when automated driving takes over the car the lead , the driver will be more and more to passenger .
the technology is based especially on sensors and cameras that process the environment and process data in seconds .
following a study by the Ministry of Commerce , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways can be technically possible by 2020 .
yet driving @-@ less vehicles are expected to wait on public roads &quot; only far from 2020 . &quot;
the value added in the area of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the location of Germany will estimate the authors of the study by 2025 to around 8.4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of the cars can lead to more safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the SPD : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ ör@@ en Bart@@ ol &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the question of liability for accidents and the safety of the personal data of the driver must be clari@@ fied .
however , the Germans are still aware of the German driving cars - much more than the French or Americans .
one on Wednesday at the AA fore@@ front survey of the For@@ sa Institute in order to ensure that only eight percent of German think that self @-@ prop@@ elled cars will prevail during the next decade , 32 percent count not only in 20 years , 31 percent believe not at all .
in France 21 per cent of respon@@ dents were surveyed by 2025 with independent cars , in the USA 33 percent .
in Germany , drivers still not ready to leave the driving car in Germany completely .
after a survey of the digital existing B@@ IT@@ KO@@ M , only seven percent would agree to de@@ position control during the entire trip on all roads .
at the fre@@ eway , the traffic could take at least 15 percent , while at St@@ au 45 percent .
well each V@@ oted would leave your control under no circumstances .

Gaul@@ tier feels too old for a enf@@ ant
it is a mixture of quite big mo@@ den@@ see and a wax @-@ Gr@@ us@@ el@@ kab@@ in@@ ett : the designer Jean Paul Gaul@@ tier ( 63 ) has presented an exhibition on Wednesday in Munich on Wednesday .
the highlights : display man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins , which can look similar to video proj@@ ections through video proj@@ ections .
they carry the spectacular cre@@ ations of the French designer , which became the stage out@@ fits in the great Star of the fashion scene among others - and that he was men in the coats .
&quot; I can no longer say that I am the enf@@ ant of the Haute Cou@@ ture since I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was mild late , now it is real &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gaul@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the Br@@ walk ) , which is visible from 18 September to the Kunsth@@ alle of Hyp@@ o @-@ Cultural Foundation , it is a good fortune that the Mod@@ ular@@ is has changed his own look at the beginning of the h@@ yp@@ o @-@ cultural foundation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually he would have been about it , for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me a show a bit after death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when it dies , you get to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously done in Montreal , Canada and Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there &apos;s so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it applies to tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society .
the exhibits indicate an insight into the gu@@ ard@@ ess work of the man who has written the fashion story without ever having completed an apprenti@@ ces@@ hip as a study .
chron@@ ologically the show is not built , but it &apos;s an excellent chore@@ ograph@@ ed complete art work , for which much effort was operated : to fr@@ inge the d@@ olls , became an example for example a styl@@ ist .
according to the information provided by the Cur@@ ators Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot have crossed over 14 tons of material .
shortly before the start of the Oktober@@ fest@@ es was a special Sch@@ man@@ ker@@ l : a le@@ ather@@ less out@@ fit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he always interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are female @-@ men than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gaul@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also Gaul@@ tier &apos;s old Teddy is in the exhibition .
it stands for the first , z@@ ag@@ grav@@ ated mo@@ ist steps of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he attracted his Teddy B@@ HS and ra@@ iment , Gaul@@ tier said .
his parents have not allowed him to play with a doll .
the un@@ throw of fashion he then brought itself to himself .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and saw the designs of other designers how the Gaul@@ tier had told in Munich .
later I bought those who then bought .
for his first review , he could not pay the models at the models .
they got nothing , they could wash the clothes .
jewelry instead of Gard@@ ine - Pl@@ au@@ ded top as fashion @-@ niche
previously , it went to the long nitrogen la@@ thes in and around plans to make up the feet .
the embroi@@ dered substances and tips developed in great amount for customers who used for example to bl@@ ank@@ ets and curtains .
today the alone does not work anymore , Andreas Rein@@ hardt explains the managing director of the mo@@ st@@ heat .
instead , mode is important .
in the initial time of the pl@@ au@@ ght tip mode , fashion played a major role in fashion , has then displac@@ ed through the home textiles industry - and is now being re@@ discovered as niche .
Rein@@ hardt is called for some examples : a tip in jewelry , accessories such as bags and regional trails .
in all , the so @-@ called vintage fashion which adap@@ ts to the past style , an increasing client potential .
if anyone has no niche in the textiles industry in Germany , it is no longer on the market .
it has already taken half of all orders already .
mo@@ ds slots is coming together with nine other companies in the industry association pl@@ au@@ ra top and past@@ ry shops .
only they must bear the protected label .
in the past 15 years , about 80 percent of sales were taken away .
private specialized shops and wholesale are almost no longer available .
our products are not able to reach our customers on this road .
the mass production presently produce much cheaper in the Asian region , and is almost exclusively distributed by chains .
apart from export , current to Russia and in the USA .
sufficient reasons so for new ways .
the industry association also attempts to focus on environmental awareness , such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer from the embroi@@ der@@ y in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since this year we introduce a quality seal that we produce ec@@ ologically and soci@@ ally rep@@ lic@@ ated . &quot;

EU wants to double mercury limit value in pir@@ ated
the European Commission intends to double the limit values for mercury in large lo@@ d@@ fish and consumers make it a clearly higher dose of the afflicted .
the consumer watch F@@ ood@@ watch , which is a significant employer of the EU , critic@@ ised the plans for the &quot; risks and adverse reactions of industrial and environmental policy along with full force of pregnant and infants , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch .
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limits of the nerv@@ ous system for large fish at the end of the food chain such as Hai@@ - or S@@ wor@@ d@@ fish can be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram of fish .
big rob@@ ber @-@ fish can be tor@@ tured as long as strongly with mercury that may not be sold out on the basis of the limits around 50 per cent of fish .
after dou@@ bling of the limit values , only 14.5 percent would be dis@@ cour@@ te@@ ous .
in exchange for this loos@@ ening the EU wants to tigh@@ ten the limit values in other fish from currently 0.5 mg to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ ood@@ watch said this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tri@@ ck , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because smaller pe@@ ac@@ ons , like car@@ p , usually so low , that they already comply with the planned limits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is therefore , &quot; a per@@ fi@@ der di@@ stra@@ ction maneu@@ ver that helps the economy alone , &quot; stated Wolf@@ sch@@ midt .
mercury is a high @-@ grade heavy metall , which is strongly enrich@@ ed over the food chain above all in a cat@@ fish .
the federal government therefore war@@ ns that &quot; small amounts especially could cause severe damage on the nerv@@ ous system . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Ministry of Environment declared its homepage in terms of relative limits that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health concern of the general public &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not expected to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury could reach the environment especially through the burning of coal .
according to a written information provided by the Federal Ministry of Environment , Ann@@ alena Ba@@ er@@ bo@@ ck ordered more than six tonnes of mercury in the year , two @-@ thirds of the total amount issued in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish approximately from the river Elbe , Rhine and Danube would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permanently and nationwide &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; quoted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in March from the paper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , in the last year , in excess of mercury in fish already accounted for the most common health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
