a ) This Convention shall apply to non @-@ nuclear weapons , the contracting party of the contract and become members of the association , in force , i ) if the relevant state of the organization noti@@ fies that its procedures are concluded for the entry into force of this Convention ;
( II ) if the Community of the Organization noti@@ fies that it is able to apply its security measures in relation to this State for the purposes of this Convention .
a ) The organization , the community and the states consult each other on request of one of the contracting parties on a change of this Convention .
B ) All changes require the approval of the Organization , the Community and the States .
C ) The General Director shall immediately inform all Member States of the Organization from any amend@@ ment of this Convention .
a ) This Convention enters into force on the day when the organization of the Community and the States receives the written notification that their procedures are concluded for entry into force .
B ) This Agreement shall remain in force for so long as the states are the contracting party of the contract .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; used in this agreement means the Convention and the Protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the purpose of this part of the Convention is to determine the procedures to be applied in the implementation of the provisions of part I through preventive measures .
the aim of the procedures set out in this Convention is the timely discovery of the bran@@ ching of significant quantities of nuclear weapons of peaceful nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices for unknown purposes , as well as deter@@ r@@ ence from such a junction through the risk of early detection .
in order to enrich the target set specified in Article 28 , material accounting is used as a preventive measure of fundamental importance , combined with spatial integration and observation as important complementary measures .
the technical conclusion of the investigations by the organization is carried out by an explanation in which material quantity specified for each material balance sheet is specified for a certain period of time , indicating the accuracy limits for the specified amounts .
in carrying out their investigations , the organization makes 3 full use of the security system of the Community in accordance with Article 3 .
the accounting and control system of the Community for core material according to this Convention is based on an outline in material balance zones .
in the application of its securing measures , the Community of de procedures and measures will make use of the following kind and , as far as necessary , fores@@ ee how they are near@@ er intended and expe@@ dient in the supplementary agreements :
a ) a measuring system to determine the quantities of preserved , produced , lost , lost or otherwise removed core material and stock quantity ;
B ) assessing the reproduci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and estim@@ ation of measuring uncertainty ;
C ) procedures for determination , testing and evaluation of differences in the measurements of sender and recipient ;
e ) procedures for the evaluation of accum@@ ulations of non @-@ measured continu@@ ances and not measured losses ;
F ) a protocol - and reporting system , which points to the core material inventory and the changes in this inventory including the inputs and outputs of the material balance zone for each material balance zone ;
( g ) Con@@ ventions which ensure that the accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) Proced@@ ure to report reports to the organization in accordance with Articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the securing measures in accordance with this Convention do not extend to material in mining or ore preparation .
B ) Ur@@ an - or half @-@ containing material , which has not yet reached the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle described in the letter c ) , is introduced into the states , so the association of the organization shares the quantity and composition of the material unless it is introduced for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ;
C ) relies on core material that is suitable for fuel production or is@@ ot@@ op@@ ic enrich@@ ment , the plant or process phase in which it is produced , or is introduced into the states in a later phase of the nuclear fuel cycle , so it is subject to the other securing measures mentioned in this Convention .
a ) The safety measures envis@@ aged in this Agreement shall be terminated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 11 . if the provisions specified in Article 11 are not fulfilled , the Community is in the opinion that the recovery of core material , which is subject to securing measures in accordance with this Convention , is preliminary not possible or desirable from residues , so consult the organization and the community on the use of suitable securing measures .
B ) The safety measures envis@@ aged in this Agreement shall be terminated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 13 , provided that the organization and the community realize that this core material is virtually non @-@ re@@ cover@@ able .
upon request of the community , the organisation fre@@ es the following core material from the securing measures in accordance with this Convention :
a ) special fis@@ sile material when used in grams - or smaller amounts as a sensor in instruments ;
B ) Nu@@ clear material if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities pursuant to Article 13 , if such nuclear material is re@@ cover@@ able , and
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 , which is above 80 % .
upon request of the community the organisation fre@@ es the core material which would otherwise be subject to security measures in accordance with this Convention , from these safegu@@ ards insofar as the total amount of the core material delivered in the states at no time amounts to at any time than
a ) a total of one kilogram of special fol@@ dable material , which can consist of one or more of the following materials :
II ) Ur@@ an with an accumulation of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multi@@ pl@@ ying its weight with enrich@@ ment ,
III ) Ur@@ an with enrich@@ ment , which is below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above the natural ur@@ anium , calculated by multi@@ pl@@ ying its weight with the fi@@ v@@ ef@@ old square of enrich@@ ment ;
a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ anium and depl@@ eted ur@@ anium with enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) 20,000 metric tons of depl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an enrich@@ ment of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
if delivered core material is to be processed or stored together with core material , which is subject to the securing measures in accordance with this Convention , precau@@ tions are taken for the re@@ application of the securing measures on that material .
the Community meets with the Organization Suppl@@ ementary agreements necessary to the extent that is necessary for the successful and effective implementation of the organisation &apos;s tasks in accordance with this Convention , in particular how the procedures laid down in the Convention are to be applied .
the suppl@@ em@@ enting agreements can be extended or changed without any changes to the agreement between the organisation and the community .
the supplementary agreements entered into force with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention . the organization , the community and the states undertake all efforts to allow these agreements to enter into force within nin@@ ety days after the entry into force of this Convention ; an extension of this period requires the agreement between the organization , the community and the states .
based on the initial report described in Article 62 , the Organization provides a summari@@ zed inventory of all the core material underlying the securing measures in the states , regardless of its origin , and continues this inventory account on account of subsequent reports and results of their investigations .
between the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Federal Republic of Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation ( Organisation ) on the other
the E@@ WG has decided to contribute to the special action programme defined at the conference for international economic cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low in@@ comes , whose development is imped@@ ed by common resources problems .
C ) The objective of the EEC and the Member States is that the whole contribution made by Member States is bound within six months after the entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible is spent in the form of loans within two years after entry into force , and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal .
D ) The EEC and the Organization have consul@@ ted each other about the proposed implementation and administration of this agreement and the central ties in order to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
for this purpose , the organisation of the EEC has presented a table that is evident in which way it intends to apply the criteria set forth in this agreement .
the organization establishes a special account under the name &quot; Promo@@ tional Account &quot; which consists of funds made by the Member States in accordance with this Agreement and uses ( in this property the organization is referred to as &quot; Administrator &quot; ) , only to the purpose specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement .
the discount account is managed separately and separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
the fees are to be paid as follows : a ) Payment shall be made in the form of cash or non @-@ interest recei@@ v@@ ables of the member state , which are to be paid upon request in the currency of the respective state at the order of the organization as administrator of the special transaction bank and to be deposited at the back of the organization in the relevant country .
B ) The payment shall be made in two install@@ ments , and i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 BG@@ N . within 30 days after entry into force of this agreement or to another between the EEC and the car@@ et@@ aker appointed time ;
II ) the second in the amount of the balance of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at any other date agreed between the EEC and the ste@@ ward , taking into account the periods required for parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans .
C ) Each Member State may , upon request , make payments prior to the above @-@ mentioned dates .
according to the usual method of organization , the administrator takes about proportional withdraw@@ als to the cash or the Notes to cover expenses for the transaction loan and balance the special transaction in an appropriate manner .
in the granting of such loans , the car@@ et@@ aker can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the EEC :
III ) the extent to which international economic factors have contributed to the country &apos;s current and fores@@ eeable economic problems ;
VI ) the composition and tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its further bor@@ rowing capacity to loan conditions without discounts ; and
VII ) the scope in which the problems of the countries concerned can be regulated by contributions from other sources .
every transaction loan is used to finance a clearly defined and rapidly exp@@ and@@ able development programme or project ( including a sec@@ toral project ) regardless of whether it belongs to the loan programme of the organization or not , according to the procedures and practices used for the proper funds of the Organization financed , approved , approved and administered , with the aim of which the pre@@ am@@ ble for this agreement is to be taken into account .
the funds of the special transaction must not be used instead of the Bank &apos;s International Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organization , which are tied to a program or project within the framework of a loan or loan , which has already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the Organization on the day of the entry into force of this agreement .
in addition to Section 4 , special transaction Lo@@ ans are subject to the same re@@ payment terms that are generally applicable to the development loan granted by the organization ; they are thus ref@@ und@@ able in 50 years at a time of ten free years .
transaction Lo@@ ans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are ref@@ und@@ able in these currencies .
amounts to pay this tra@@ cker are to be paid directly to the organization that retains it .
each transaction loan must be issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator in which particular the source of the funds is given .
recei@@ pts from any transaction loan may be used for spending in the currency of the recipient country , or for goods or services produced or specified in developing countries , which are members of the organization and which according to the administrator defined at the time of the loan granted may be recipients of a special loan .
capital re@@ payments from transaction loans are made on the special transaction account , and the amount returned in this way in the currency of a Member State shall be transferred back to the Member State as soon as possible by the administrator .
the car@@ et@@ aker informs the EEC as far as the complete assignment of all transaction loans for the audi@@ tor in preparation and about the projects and programmes approved by the directors .
during the period of the withdrawal of the transaction loan , the administrator is informed quar@@ terly about the development of the promotional loan and the expendi@@ tures made for this .
the administrator transm@@ its the E@@ WG as soon as possible after the end of the financial year of the organization a detailed account of the transaction account with an opinion of the external audi@@ tors of the organization for this account closure .
after full payment of the transaction loan , the administrator of the EEC will soon report a detailed report on the projects and programmes financed by the special transaction account .
the administrator creates and exec@@ utes appropriate records and invoices from which the contributions to the special transaction account , the amounts paid out from the account , and the amounts paid out of the account , and the withdraw@@ als to the Member States are evident .
the EEC and the car@@ et@@ aker are working closely together to achieve the objectives of the agreement .
for this purpose , the EEC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the car@@ et@@ aker up to the complete issue of the promotion account funds from time to time will exchange ideas about the status of the special transaction account , the progress of programmes or projects financed by special transaction fees and any other questions affecting the provisions of this agreement .
if this agreement was not entered into force on 31 December 1978 , or at a later date which the EEC and the Organisation may agree on , the agreement and all obligations arising from it shall be due to immediate effect .
if the total amount of capital paid by all Rec@@ ei@@ vers made by the benef@@ ici@@ aries is rep@@ aid in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this Agreement and returned to the Member States , this Agreement and all obligations arising from it shall be terminated with immediate effect .
this agreement requires approval by the individual Member States and the EEC as per the proced@@ ural provisions of each party .
the governments of the Member States notified the General Sec@@ retariat of the Council of the European Communities the conclusion of the procedures concerned .
the General Sec@@ retariat for@@ wards these noti@@ fications along with a notification of the proper approval of the agreement by the EEC to the Organization .
this agreement becomes effective and enters into force on the first day of the month following the date of receipt of the mentioned noti@@ fications in the organization .
this agreement is written in two sig@@ natures in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch , with each wording binding .
whereas the agreement in the form of a correspondence to am@@ end the Annex A of Protocol No. 1 to the Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) has been adopted , HA@@ T has issued the following Convention :
between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EURO@@ PE@@ AN Atom@@ ic Energy Community , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; represented by the Commission of the European Communities , herein@@ after called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Commission &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the Swiss Con@@ federation , herein@@ after called &quot; Switzerland , &quot; represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after called the &quot; Federal Council , &quot;
this program includes the creation of a large experimental facility , the J@@ ET project ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) , whose construction and operation of a joint venture according to Chapter V of the Eur@@ atom Treaty - herein@@ after called &quot; Joint Company J@@ ET &quot; - is transp@@ os@@ ed .
Switzerland has been involved in research work in the area of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics for several years and is very familiar with the area in question .
as to the practical use of controlled nuclear fusion , extensive work is to be carried out , it is in the interest of the contracting parties of the present agreement to bring together their respective efforts to avoid unnecessary overl@@ aps and to accelerate their respective research efforts , which have reached a higher priority level due to the energy crisis .
this agreement should enable any contracting party to take advantage of unnecessary overl@@ aps due to a merger of their research efforts in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics to achieve the common objective of this research work , i.e. the cost @-@ competitive electricity generation by using the controlled nuclear fusion reaction .
to achieve the objective of the present agreement , the contracting parties associate their respective research programmes identified in Annex I and II of this agreement , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom Programme &quot; and &quot; Swiss Programme . &quot;
to ensure effective cooperation , the Swiss program under@@ takes the long @-@ term objectives and forms of co @-@ operation of the Eur@@ atom Programme ; it will be extended or amended by the organs mentioned in Articles 5 to 10 and Article 16 of the present agreement so that it may include new activities relevant to the Eur@@ atom program .
each time the contracting parties adopt a new programme , this will take place in place of the programs listed in Annex I and II to the present agreement .
the association stipulated in paragraph 1 shall be realised through : - appropriate participation of each of the contracting parties during the preparation and execution of programmes of the other party ;
- Exchange of staff among the relevant laboratories in the Eur@@ atom Member States , in Switzerland and third countries , with whom Eur@@ atom concluded a similar agreement as the present agreement , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; associated third countries , &quot; as well as the laboratories that collaborate with the Eur@@ atom program ;
- mutual right to access to the scientific and technical results of the respective programs .
as part of the scope of the present agreement , Switzerland is involved in the J@@ ET project .
in view of the association agreement stipulated in Article 2 paragraph 1 of this agreement , the parties contract an association agreement , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Association Agreement , &quot; which is as far as possible to those between the Commission and the States , or individuals , herein@@ after called &quot; Associ@@ ated Organ@@ s , &quot; with regard to the implementation of the Eur@@ atom Programme .
with the same objective Eur@@ atom is concerned that with the date of the entry into force of the present agreement , Switzerland is involved in the agreement on the promotion of personnel exchange , which is concluded between the Commission and the Associ@@ ated organs , herein@@ after called &quot; Agreement on Person@@ nel Development . &quot;
in view of the participation in the J@@ ET project , Switzerland is part of J@@ ET &apos;s joint venture with the date of the entry into force of the present agreement , whose by@@ laws are accepted .
furthermore , Eur@@ atom is concerned that Switzerland may become the contracting partner of any contract whose destination is within the framework of the present agreement , except association agreements or other similar contracts concluded by Eur@@ atom during the validity period of the present agreement .
the organs responsible for carrying out the association provided in Article 2 paragraph 1 of the present agreement are described in Articles 5 to 10 of this Agreement and the Association Agreement .
in particular , the association agreement compl@@ ements the suspension of a steering committee consisting of the competent representatives of the Commission and the Council of the Federation .
- to monitor the development of the research work and to direct the goal of achieving the best possible results in line with the objectives of the agreement .
Switzerland is represented by a maximum of two delegates in the connection group used as part of the Eur@@ atom Programme - in the following &quot; VG . &quot;
the VG , which has to ensure the exchange of information and cooperation in all matters relating to the current or planned programmes and activities in the area of the Eur@@ atom program , perc@@ ei@@ ves this task with regard to all research and development activities that this agreement relates .
in particular , it promotes cooperation and coordination between the associated organs and alig@@ ns its activities with the interests of both parties to the common objective defined in the Eur@@ atom Programme and in Article 1 of the present agreement , taking into account the scientific and technological developments in the world .
according to their Rules of Proced@@ ure , VG will appoint one or more Swiss representatives at the consulting groups created within the Eur@@ atom Programme , whenever the relevant Swiss authorities seek for it .
the Advisory Groups , which are subject to the VG research proposals with a view to providing the best possible scientific results for the Eur@@ atom program , perceive this task with regard to all research and development work referred to in this agreement .
in the committee of directors involved in the Eur@@ atom Programme , Switzerland is represented by the director of one of the participating laboratories .
the committee of directors who supervis@@ es the implementation of the Eur@@ atom Programme and who is responsible for ensuring that the capacity of the laboratories involved in the work carried out within the framework of the program leads to this task with regard to all research and development work that fall under the present agreement .

a Swiss representative is entitled to participate in the meetings of all co @-@ ordin@@ ating committees as part of the Eur@@ atom Programme .
the coordin@@ ating committees , which provide appropriate suggestions for the best possible use of resources , personnel and knowledge and skills that are involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom Programme , are taking this task in the respective area with regard to all research and development work that fall under the present agreement .
the BA@@ F is a representative of each Member State of Eur@@ atom , Switzerland and any associate member state for the core and energy studies .
at the request of the Commission , the BA@@ F cons@@ ults the Commission with regard to the implementation of the programme and the possible changes in the exec@@ utions as well as in preparing the future programmes and defining its overall scope , co @-@ ordination and integration of national activities at Community level in the area of fusion .
the statements of the BA@@ F , the VG , the Governing Board , the Advisory Groups and the Co@@ ordination Com@@ mittees have an advisory character .
the opinion of the VG on the urgent actions is compulsory ; the same applies to the committee &apos;s committee in the field of personnel exchange .
the representatives of the two contracting parties participate in the work of all technical advisory committees or of all administrative bodies created for the purposes of the present agreement .
Switzerland &apos;s financial contribution to the Eur@@ atom program according to this agreement is annually fixed to an amount determined by Eur@@ atom &apos;s portion of the cost of the Eur@@ atom program in the same proportion as the gross domestic product of Eur@@ atom and Switzerland last year .
concerning the J@@ ET project , this financial contribution refers to the participation of Eur@@ atom on the joint undertaking as soon as this is established .
moreover , Switzerland transfers an amount to the Joint Business J@@ ET , which is determined in accordance with the financial provisions of the statute of this common company .
the contribution of the financial contribution that Eur@@ atom provides to finance the work within the context of the association agreement and the agreement on human resource exchange is calculated on the same basis that is usually used to calculate the Eur@@ atom contributions to finance the work carried out on the basis of the relevant tre@@ aties .
the Commission shares the Federal Council at the beginning of the year , which is intended to cover expenses within the framework of the Eur@@ atom Programme for the year concerned .
the Federal Council pays the amount due to this article as follows : 7 / 12 before 15 January and 5 / 12 before the 15 .

in the form of a correspondence to am@@ end the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation
in addition , in order to simplify the procedure for adapting the tari@@ ff @-@ tari@@ ff terms in the case of renewed amendments to the customs tari@@ ff of one of the contracting parties in the future , it appears further indicated to include an article 12 to the agreement .
I honor you to confirm the consent of the Community to these changes and propose to you as an appointment for entry into force 1 January 1978 .
I would be grateful if you confirm the consent of your government to the above .
I honor you to confirm the receipt of your present letter with the following wording :
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would confirm the consent of your government to the for@@ ego@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
agreement in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements on the Mobili@@ zation of Member States &apos; demands as part of the medium @-@ term financial support
the BI@@ S could conclude stand@@ by credit agreements with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries , when banks submit an appropriate application .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the agreement could be closed down to the total amount of the agreement paid by the credi@@ tor country within a total limit of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion units ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future delivery investment funds of the member states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even now , however , below are some conditions for which the BI@@ S would be willing to use .
with each stand@@ by credit , the BI@@ S would initially take over an obligation for two years , with the possibility of renew@@ als without having to exceed five years altogether .
at the opening of the loans as well as with their possible extension , BI@@ S would charge a loan opening commission .
in addition , it would be agreed that the first drawing will not be made before the end of one month after conclusion of the stand@@ by agreement so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity .
the drawing would be in the currencies available at the BI@@ S at the end of the agreement , very likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods taking into account the funds of the bank , presumably three or six months .
the conditions would correspond to those that the BI@@ S applied at the respective time based on similar conditions , i.e. interest rates would largely correspond to market rates .
if the BI@@ S has to acquire the necessary means even in the market , then the interest rate to apply to the application could reach a maximum which corresponds to the corresponding margin increased Li@@ bor .
I would be grateful if you would give me the consent of the Council of the European Communities to do so .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BI@@ S could conclude stand@@ by loan agreements with central banks of the credi@@ tor countries when banks submit an appropriate application . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would give me the consent of the Council of the European Communities to do so . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I honour to give you the consent of the Council of the European Communities to the content of this letter .

a re@@ agent for blood group determination must react with all tested blood samples that contain the an@@ tigen that is hom@@ olog@@ ous to the antibody or another substance on the label .
if a re@@ agent is used in the manner recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena cannot occur : a ) hem@@ oly@@ tic properties ;
the ti@@ ter is measured twice in a suitable medium by repeated di@@ lution of the re@@ agent to be checked .
the ti@@ ter is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of strongest serum di@@ lution in which a reaction occurs ; di@@ lution is calculated exclusively by volume of blood flow flus@@ hing in the total volume .
in Anti @-@ A , Anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents that are to be used on object carriers , the activity is expressed by the time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier .
the World Health Organization has established international standards for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B , as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents for blood group determination international standards , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity are elabor@@ ated at the time standards .
according to definition , an international standard preparation contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the ti@@ ters observed in individual preparations red blood cells ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group determination of most species is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ sti@@ ter observed in a series of di@@ lu@@ tions in ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te flus@@ hing .
the ti@@ ter den@@ otes the di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the final mixture within a series where a micro@@ scopic visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
the effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group determination , for which international standard preparations are present ( currently Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B as well as incomplete anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of the ti@@ tr@@ ation of the unknown re@@ agent in International units ( See Bulletin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 301 . ) .
if you bring them back to a volume of 1 ml , the Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B S@@ ears contain according to definition 256 international units per ml .
the preparations are available free of charge from the International Laboratory of Bi@@ ological Standards of the World Health Organization , Stat@@ ens Ser@@ um Institute , Copenhagen .
the following table shows an example of a comparative ti@@ tr@@ ation of the International Anti @-@ A ( S ) and an unknown Anti @-@ A re@@ agent ( U ) against red blood cells A1 and red blood cells A@@ 2@@ B . &gt; P@@ IC FI@@ LE = &quot; T@@ 00@@ 4@@ 50@@ 83 &quot; &gt;
if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , the required properties should be maintained for at least one year .
the exp@@ iry date of a re@@ agent in a fluid form according to the label is at most one year after the last satisfactory efficacy test .
the date of exp@@ iry date for dry re@@ agents on the label is based on the results of the durability tests ; it must be approved by the state supervisory authorities .
dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container in which they have been dried and which is closed so that no moisture can penetrate .
a dry re@@ agent may lose no more than 0,5 b.@@ H. of its weight if it is tested by further drying of phosph@@ or@@ ous pent@@ ine in a pressure of no more than 0,@@ 02 mm Hg within 24 hours .
in order to avoid bacterial growth , the competent state authority may determine that the re@@ agent ( or the solvent supplied with the dry re@@ agents ) is added to an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic , provided that the re@@ agent with the added substance continues to fulfill the requirements for specific@@ ity and effectiveness .
sera human origin for blood group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg of protein nitrogen per ml of flu@@ ent or re @-@ dissolved serum .
the re@@ agents , whether in fluid form or after re @-@ release , must be transparent and may not contain sedi@@ ments , gels or visible particles .
the re@@ agents destined for the international exchange should not be colored arti@@ fici@@ ally as possible , at least as long as there is no international agreement about a uniform system .
re@@ agents for blood group determination are to be distributed in such a manner and in such quantities that the re@@ agent contained in a container is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the quantity in a container must be so large that the content may be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturer &apos;s laboratory has written records of all levels of production and checks of re@@ agents for blood group determination .
reasonable samples of all of the re@@ agents spend so long can be stored by the laboratory until some probability can be assumed that the batch is no longer used .
the re@@ agents used for blood group identification can contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective part , the others are the necessary aids to strengthen the effectiveness and maintain stability of the re@@ agent .
for technical reasons these re@@ agents are divided into three groups according to the origin of their active part .
this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin only contain substances of human origin , or that animal or plant re@@ agents do not contain substances of human origin .
on each individual tank there is a black printed label in English and French , which contains the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
4. the quantity or , in the case of dried re@@ agents , the quantity and composition of the liquid required for re @-@ release ,
in addition , this label or label on the box where the individual containers are located , or the instructions attached to the containers contain the following information : 1 . full name and address of the manufacturer ,
3. the quantity or , in the case of dried re@@ agents , the quantity and composition of the liquid required for re @-@ release ,
each shipment must be accompanied by a certificate according to Article 4 of the Convention according to the Annex to this Protocol .

the following requirements for the effectiveness of Ser@@ a to determine the R@@ h @-@ Group may change if international standard preparations are available . ( i ) Anti @-@ D ( Anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) blood @-@ group serum ( human )
anti @-@ D serum is obtained from the blood of one or more individuals immun@@ ised by the an@@ tigen D of the R@@ h @-@ System .
it re@@ acts with human red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen D , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the an@@ tigen D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; complete &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Anti @-@ D Ser@@ a must have a ti@@ ter of at least 1 : 32 compared to C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells in a 0.@@ 9@@ % sal@@ ine solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;

based on the Joint Declaration adopted by the ministers of the EF@@ TA countries and the Member States of the Community and the Commission of the European Communities on 9 April 1984 in Luxembourg , which includes a call for the creation of a European Economic Area , particularly with regard to simpli@@ fying the border form@@ alities and the rules of origin ,
in THE B@@ EST , that the Community decided within the Action Plan to Str@@ eng@@ then the Single Market , to implement a unified system of management from 1 January 1988 .
in THE weigh@@ ting that it is appropriate to simplify the transportation of goods between the Community and the EF@@ TA countries as well as between the individual EF@@ TA countries , in particular by the introduction of a uniform administration document ,
in the provision that this Convention shall not be interpreted in the manner that it with@@ ds the contracting parties from its obligations from other international agreements .
in this Convention , measures are set to simplify the transportation of goods between the Community and the EF@@ TA countries as well as between the individual EF@@ TA countries ; in particular , a uniform management paper ( herein@@ after referred to as single paper ) is used for all export and import methods , as well as for a common shipment process ( herein@@ after referred to as shipping method ) between the contracting parties .
the for@@ esters linked to the merchandise traffic between the contracting parties are authorized by means of a single document , for which prints are to be used according to the samples in Annex I to this Convention .
according to the case , the paper document serves as application or paper for export , shipping or import@@ ation .
- in order to carry out the legal regulations in force in a contracting party whose application would not be guaranteed in the sole use of the single unit ;
- must be requested by the parties in order that they may be able to come to the pleas@@ ures of a provision or a certain relief .
( 1 ) This Agreement does not prevent the contracting parties to apply simplified procedures , even in the use of data processing , with regard to further facil@@ itation of the parties involved .
( 2 ) Simp@@ li@@ fied procedures can , in particular , fores@@ ee that the goods concerned are not to be set at a customs office and the registration for these goods cannot be submitted to the customs office ; furthermore , the delivery of an incomplete registration can be allowed .
in these cases an application must subsequently be made , in which it can act with the consent of the competent authorities for perio@@ dic gather@@ ings of goods within the deadline set by these authorities .
in cases of paragraph 1 , it may be permitted to use trade station@@ ers instead of the unit paper .
if the consistency paper is used , the parties may include , with the consent of the competent authorities , to provide all relevant lists pertaining to import and import@@ ation instead of the supplementary sheets in the trade lists in which the goods are described .
- to conclude agreements or agreements with regard to further simpli@@ fication of the prob@@ abilities of all goods traffic or for sub@@ divisions ;
- for shipments that include several types of goods , for the provision of the form@@ alities in the shipping method charge list instead of the supplementary sheets to use paper ;
- allowing registration to be created , if necessary , by means of public or private data processing plants according to the conditions set out by the competent authorities ;
- Al@@ low that the competent authorities require the input of the data required for the establishment of the relevant form@@ alities in their data processing systems for the treatment of the applications , and , if necessary , without giving a written application ;
- To allow the competent authorities in the event of the use of a data processing system for the treatment of filing , that the export , shipping or import alert will be made either by the safety paper created by this system or , if such a paper is not created , by entering the data into the data processing plant ;
- Assist@@ ance to the exemp@@ tion adopted by the Mix@@ ed Committee in the way of a decision pursuant to Article 11 paragraph 3 .
( 1 ) The provisions governing the provision of the services necessary for the export , shipping and import of goods by means of the single document are laid down in App@@ endi@@ x II to this Convention .
( 2 ) The common codes that are to be used in App@@ endi@@ x I listed below are to be found in Annex III to this Convention .
( 1 ) The application shall be issued in one of the official languages of the contracting parties authorised by the competent authorities of the country in which the provisions for export or shipping are to be met .
if necessary , the customs authority of the country of destination or transit country may require a translation of the registration into the official language or any of the official languages of this country .
( 2 ) In contrary to paragraph 1 , the application shall always be deemed to be issued in one of the official languages of the import country , if in this country they are carried out by other than the copies of the customs of the export or lo@@ oming countries .
( 1 ) The applicant or his representative may apply for each individual stage of a goods traffic between the contracting parties involved only in this one section required registration copies , to which , if necessary , the necessary copies to be included in one of the following sections may be attached .
( 2 ) The use of paragraph 1 may not be associated with a special condition of the competent authorities .
without prejudi@@ ce to the special provisions on collective con@@ sign@@ ment , the competent authorities can see , however , that the form@@ alities for export and shipping procedures can be based on one and the same preliminary pressure by means of the copies provided for these form@@ alities .
in the cases of Article 7 , the competent authorities are convinced as far as possible of the fact that the information contained in the individual sections of the application is identical .
