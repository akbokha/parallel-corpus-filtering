<seg id="728">Based on the initial report described in Article 62, the Organization provides a summarized inventory of all the core material underlying the securing measures in the states, regardless of its origin, and continues this inventory account on account of subsequent reports and results of their investigations.</seg>
<seg id="729">Between the European Economic Community (EEC) and its Member States Belgium, Denmark, Federal Republic of Germany, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, United Kingdom (Member States) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation (Organisation) on the other</seg>
<seg id="730">The EWG has decided to contribute to the special action programme defined at the conference for international economic cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low incomes, whose development is impeded by common resources problems.</seg>
<seg id="731">C) The objective of the EEC and the Member States is that the whole contribution made by Member States is bound within six months after the entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible is spent in the form of loans within two years after entry into force, and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal.</seg>
<seg id="732">D) The EEC and the Organization have consulted each other about the proposed implementation and administration of this agreement and the central ties in order to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="733">For this purpose, the organisation of the EEC has presented a table that is evident in which way it intends to apply the criteria set forth in this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="734">The organization establishes a special account under the name "Promotional Account" which consists of funds made by the Member States in accordance with this Agreement and uses (in this property the organization is referred to as "Administrator"), only to the purpose specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="735">The discount account is managed separately and separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="736">The fees are to be paid as follows: a) Payment shall be made in the form of cash or non-interest receivables of the member state, which are to be paid upon request in the currency of the respective state at the order of the organization as administrator of the special transaction bank and to be deposited at the back of the organization in the relevant country.</seg>
<seg id="737">B) The payment shall be made in two installments, and i) the first in the amount of at least 45 BGN. within 30 days after entry into force of this agreement or to another between the EEC and the caretaker appointed time;</seg>
<seg id="738">II) the second in the amount of the balance of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at any other date agreed between the EEC and the steward, taking into account the periods required for parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans.</seg>
<seg id="739">C) Each Member State may, upon request, make payments prior to the above-mentioned dates.</seg>
<seg id="740">According to the usual method of organization, the administrator takes about proportional withdrawals to the cash or the Notes to cover expenses for the transaction loan and balance the special transaction in an appropriate manner.</seg>
<seg id="741">In the granting of such loans, the caretaker can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the EEC:</seg>
<seg id="742">III) the extent to which international economic factors have contributed to the country's current and foreseeable economic problems;</seg>
<seg id="743">VI) the composition and tendency of the country's debt service and its further borrowing capacity to loan conditions without discounts; and</seg>
<seg id="744">VII) the scope in which the problems of the countries concerned can be regulated by contributions from other sources.</seg>
<seg id="745">Every transaction loan is used to finance a clearly defined and rapidly expandable development programme or project (including a sectoral project) regardless of whether it belongs to the loan programme of the organization or not, according to the procedures and practices used for the proper funds of the Organization financed, approved, approved and administered, with the aim of which the preamble for this agreement is to be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="746">The funds of the special transaction must not be used instead of the Bank's International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (Bank) or the Organization, which are tied to a program or project within the framework of a loan or loan, which has already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the Organization on the day of the entry into force of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="747">In addition to Section 4, special transaction Loans are subject to the same repayment terms that are generally applicable to the development loan granted by the organization; they are thus refundable in 50 years at a time of ten free years.</seg>
<seg id="748">Transaction Loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are refundable in these currencies.</seg>
<seg id="749">Amounts to pay this tracker are to be paid directly to the organization that retains it.</seg>
<seg id="750">Each transaction loan must be issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator in which particular the source of the funds is given.</seg>
<seg id="751">Receipts from any transaction loan may be used for spending in the currency of the recipient country, or for goods or services produced or specified in developing countries, which are members of the organization and which according to the administrator defined at the time of the loan granted may be recipients of a special loan.</seg>
<seg id="752">Capital repayments from transaction loans are made on the special transaction account, and the amount returned in this way in the currency of a Member State shall be transferred back to the Member State as soon as possible by the administrator.</seg>
<seg id="753">The caretaker informs the EEC as far as the complete assignment of all transaction loans for the auditor in preparation and about the projects and programmes approved by the directors.</seg>
<seg id="754">During the period of the withdrawal of the transaction loan, the administrator is informed quarterly about the development of the promotional loan and the expenditures made for this.</seg>
<seg id="755">The administrator transmits the EWG as soon as possible after the end of the financial year of the organization a detailed account of the transaction account with an opinion of the external auditors of the organization for this account closure.</seg>
<seg id="756">After full payment of the transaction loan, the administrator of the EEC will soon report a detailed report on the projects and programmes financed by the special transaction account.</seg>
<seg id="757">The administrator creates and executes appropriate records and invoices from which the contributions to the special transaction account, the amounts paid out from the account, and the amounts paid out of the account, and the withdrawals to the Member States are evident.</seg>
<seg id="758">The EEC and the caretaker are working closely together to achieve the objectives of the agreement.</seg>
<seg id="759">For this purpose, the EEC (represented by the Commission of the European Communities) and the caretaker up to the complete issue of the promotion account funds from time to time will exchange ideas about the status of the special transaction account, the progress of programmes or projects financed by special transaction fees and any other questions affecting the provisions of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="760">If this agreement was not entered into force on 31 December 1978, or at a later date which the EEC and the Organisation may agree on, the agreement and all obligations arising from it shall be due to immediate effect.</seg>
<seg id="761">If the total amount of capital paid by all Receivers made by the beneficiaries is repaid in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this Agreement and returned to the Member States, this Agreement and all obligations arising from it shall be terminated with immediate effect.</seg>
