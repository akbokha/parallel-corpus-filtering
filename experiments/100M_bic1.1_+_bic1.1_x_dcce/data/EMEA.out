this document is a summary of the European Public Safety Report ( EP@@ P ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) has evaluated the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug .
if you need more information about your disease or treatment , please read the package insert ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if you would like more information on the basis of CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg , and 30 mg tablets , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution for intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. wir@@ l thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , di@@ str@@ ust and ins@@ anity ; • Bi@@ polar I disorder , a mental disorder in which the patients have abnormal episodes ( periods of abnormal cal@@ ci@@ dity ) alternating with periods of normal atmosphere .
A@@ bili@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and to prevent man@@ ic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used for quick control of increased rest@@ lessness or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , if oral intake of the drug is not possible .
for both diseases , the solution can be used for inser@@ ting or melting tablets in patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing tablets .
in patients who are taking other drugs as well as A@@ bili@@ fy , the dose of A@@ bili@@ fy should be adjusted .
this imp@@ airs the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable communication of nerve cells to one another .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l is thought to be a &quot; partial ag@@ ony &quot; for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l acts like 5 hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but to a lesser degree than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters to activate the recept@@ ors .
as dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin play a role in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l contributes to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , thus preventing psycho@@ tic or man@@ ic symptoms and preventing their recur@@ r@@ ence .
the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy to prevent the recur@@ r@@ ence of symptoms has been studied in three studies over up to one year .
the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 8@@ 05 patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or similar disorders , which suffered from increased un@@ rest over a period of two hours with a placebo .
in another study A@@ bili@@ fy was compared to 3@@ 47 patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol , in another study the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy and placebo to prevent recur@@ r@@ ence to 160 patients , in which the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabili@@ zed with A@@ bili@@ fy .
the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study to 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder that suffered from increased rest@@ lessness , compared to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psycho@@ tic ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies the change in the symptoms of patients was examined using a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients responding to treatment .
the company also conducted studies to examine how the body absor@@ bs the melting tablets and the solution to take up .
in both studies with the injection solution , patients who received A@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , showed a significantly greater reduction in symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness compared to those who received placebo .
in the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder A@@ bili@@ fy decreased in four of the five short @-@ term studies man@@ ic symptoms more effective than placebo .
in addition , A@@ bili@@ fy prevented the recur@@ r@@ ence of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients for up to 74 weeks and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment .
A@@ bili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10 or 15 mg doses also reduced more effective than placebo the symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness and were similarly effective as lau@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of A@@ bili@@ fy for taking ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extra@@ pyr@@ am@@ idal disorders ( un@@ controlled Zu@@ cken ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ency ( di@@ zz@@ iness ) , sei@@ z@@ ure ( di@@ sti@@ pation ) , sei@@ z@@ ure ( increased s@@ ali@@ va production ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder and in the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes were related to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l versus the risks .
in addition , the committee came to the conclusion that the advantages of the injection solution in quick control of increased rest@@ lessness and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar I disorder , if oral therapy is not suitable , out@@ weigh the risks .
June 2004 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. for placing A@@ bili@@ fy in the entire European Union .
A@@ bili@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes and whose man@@ ic episodes were related to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
increased efficacy in dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven , although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy in treating schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
due to the greater sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors warrant this ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from the combination therapy , the recommended dosage should be reduced to the recommended dosage ( see Section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psycho@@ tic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after the change of an anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy , even in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder there was no increased risk of suicide with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to other anti@@ psycho@@ tics .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ dispose to hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ a@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acute and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) .
3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies lasting one year or less , there were occasional reports about dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia performing with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
if signs and symptoms of late dy@@ sph@@ foli@@ ation occur in a patient treated with A@@ bili@@ fy , should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment .
when a patient develops signs and symptoms indic@@ ative of a m@@ n , or un@@ clear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psycho@@ tics , including A@@ bili@@ fy , must be dismissed .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be used with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or in conditions associated with sei@@ zur@@ es .
56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l had an increased risk of death compared to placebo .
however , there were in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant correlation between dosage and response to un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extreme and associated with eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psycho@@ tic agents , including A@@ bili@@ fy .
there are no accurate risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ related adverse events in patients treated with A@@ bili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psycho@@ tic agents who allow direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored in relation to wor@@ sen@@ ing glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psycho@@ tics , where weight gain is known as a side @-@ effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l on the central nervous system , caution is advised if Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally active drugs with side effects such as se@@ dation ( see paragraph 4.@@ 8 ) .
the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist fam@@ oti@@ din , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant .
in a clinical study with healthy volunteers , a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l by 107 % while the C@@ MA@@ X remained unchanged .
it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore should be made similar dose reductions .
in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; poor &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) Met@@ aboli@@ sm the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 extensive metabolism .
if one considers the joint administration of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ s inhibit@@ ors with A@@ bili@@ fy , potential benefits should out@@ weigh the potential risks for the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as is@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made .
after replacing the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or , the dose of A@@ bili@@ fy should be raised to the dose level before starting the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , together with A@@ bili@@ fy , can be attributed with a moderate increase in ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole concentrations .
in clinical studies doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the medi@@ ums of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ met@@ amor@@ an / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ ine @-@ ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( war@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( ob@@ ble@@ zo@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ met@@ orph@@ an ) .
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or planning a pregnancy during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
due to the insufficient data situation for safety in humans and due to the concerns created in the reproduction studies at the animal , this drug may not be used during pregnancy unless the potential benefits clearly justi@@ fies the potential risk for the fet@@ us .
however , as with other anti@@ psycho@@ tics , patients should be warned against dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l has no negative influence on it .
the following adverse events were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than under placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of side effects listed below is defined by the following criteria : frequent ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study over 52 weeks , patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a total reduced incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ onia and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , compared to patients treated with hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study for 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study for 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l was 15.@@ 1 % in patients with on@@ ic@@ icle therapy .
man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar I disorder - In a controlled trial for 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 23.@@ 5 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol treatment .
in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
during the long @-@ term study lasting more than 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for placebo treated patients .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and placebo with potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in routine laboratory parameters did not reveal any medi@@ cally significant differences .
enh@@ ancements of CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine phosph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
adverse events related to anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy and their occurrence also reported in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l include malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and var@@ ic@@ osis , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mort@@ ality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the market launch un@@ inten@@ tional or deliber@@ ate acute over@@ dos@@ ages with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l were observed alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and no deaths .
although there is no information on the efficacy of a hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ; however , it is unlikely that hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis is beneficial in the treatment of an over@@ dose because Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l has a high plasma protein binding .
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar I distur@@ b@@ ance on the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a @-@ recept@@ ors is medi@@ ated .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed in vitro a high aff@@ inity to the dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D@@ 3 receptor and a moderate aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 4@@ - , ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7 , to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ receptor .
using Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in doses from 0.5 to 30 mg once daily over 2 weeks to healthy subjects , the posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction in the binding of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , D2 / D@@ 3 receptor lig@@ ands , at the nucle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and at the put@@ stream .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) at 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psycho@@ tic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled trial , 52 percent of respon@@ der patients with a response to the study were similar ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measurement scales , defined as secondary study goals , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - depression rate scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than for hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study for 26 weeks in stabili@@ sed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a significantly higher reduction in the rate of rel@@ ap@@ se , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l group and 57 % under placebo .
in an O@@ stan@@ zap@@ ine @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks that included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was , an increase of at least 7 % compared with bas@@ eline ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg with an average weight of ca . ) .
in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage for 3 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a superior effectiveness in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks compared to placebo .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo .
in two placebo and active controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psycho@@ tic characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a placebo superior effectiveness in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol in week 12 .
in week 12 Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a comparable share of patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia such as lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psycho@@ tic features which partially did not apply to lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l revealed a superior effectiveness in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate .
10 In a placebo @-@ controlled trial for 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension period for 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l during a stabili@@ zation phase before random@@ ization , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed superi@@ ority to placebo for prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia .
based on in vitro studies the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the hydro@@ xy@@ profil@@ ing and hydro@@ xy@@ profil@@ ing of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , the N de@@ al@@ ky@@ ness is cataly@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the mean elimination average is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in extensive metabolism via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and at nearly 146 hours at &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) Met@@ aboli@@ sm via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy volunteers , as did pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic investigation of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients show no gender @-@ dependent effects .
a stimulation @-@ specific evaluation of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics did not reveal any clin@@ ically significant differences with respect to ethnic origin or the effect of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l were similar in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency in comparison to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study in subjects with different h@@ ep@@ atic cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the impair@@ ment of the liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
based on conventional safety har@@ mac@@ ology studies , toxic@@ ity in repeated dose , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data could not reveal any particular dangers to humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in doses or ex@@ positions which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans so they have limited or no meaning for clinical use .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent by @-@ kidney toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pigment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 60 mg / kg / day ( 10 times the average ste@@ ady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
in addition , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was detected as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1- to 3 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
however , the concentrations found in the human bile at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg of the sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of hydro@@ xy@@ - ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l do not exceed 6 % of concentrations found in the study more than 39 weeks in the bile of apes and lie far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of in vitro @-@ sol@@ ubil@@ ity .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after doses , which lead to exposure of 3 and 11 times the middle ste@@ ady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dosage .

the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
to prevent recur@@ r@@ ence of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have already received Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , the therapy should be continued with the same dose .

hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extreme and associated with eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psycho@@ tic agents , including A@@ bili@@ fy .
there are no accurate risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ related adverse events in patients treated with A@@ bili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psycho@@ tic agents who allow direct compar@@ isons .
92 In a clinical study with healthy volunteers , a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l by 107 % while the C@@ MA@@ X remained unchanged .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , together with A@@ bili@@ fy , can be attributed with a moderate increase in ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole concentrations .

it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar I distur@@ b@@ ance on the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a @-@ recept@@ ors is medi@@ ated .
in an O@@ stan@@ zap@@ ine @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks that included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was , an increase of at least 7 % compared with bas@@ eline ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg with an average weight of ca . ) .
97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo .
in a relative bio@@ availability study , in which pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l was compared to intake of 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in tablet form in healthy subjects , the ratio was between the geometric C@@ MA@@ X mean value of the solution and the value of the tablets at 122 % ( N = 30 ) .
99 Moreover , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was detected as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1- to 3 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after doses , which lead to exposure of 3 and 11 times the middle ste@@ ady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dosage .
A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution is used for quick control of det@@ achment and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar I disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate .
once it is clin@@ ically attached , the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution should be completed and commen@@ ced with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
in order to increase the absorption and minimize vari@@ ability , an injection into the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended by b@@ yp@@ assing of obes@@ e regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) may be given depending on the individual clinical status , taking into account the medicine used for maintenance or acute therapy ( see Section 4.5 ) .
if a continu@@ ative oral treatment is indicated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , see the summary of the characteristics of the medicine to A@@ bili@@ fy tablets , A@@ bili@@ fy melting tablets or A@@ bili@@ fy solution for taking .
there are no investigations on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution in patients with ag@@ ility and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , which were different from schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar I disorder .
if par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution , patients should be observed with regard to extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure drop ( see Section 4.5 ) .
studies on safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ dispose to hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ a@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acute and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) .
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies lasting one year or less , there were occasional reports about dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia performing with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
clinical manifestations of a mu@@ n are high fever , stiff@@ ness , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular heart@@ beat or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ) .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored in relation to wor@@ sen@@ ing glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psycho@@ tics , where weight gain is known as a side @-@ effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
nevertheless , the intensity of se@@ dation was greater compared with the single dose of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , in a study where healthy volunteers ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( 15 mg dose ) was in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cul@@ arly used and which at the same time received Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg doses ) in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cul@@ arly .
the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist fam@@ oti@@ din , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant .
in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; poor &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) Met@@ aboli@@ ers , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as is@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made .
after replacing the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or , the dose of A@@ bili@@ fy should be raised to the dose level before starting the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy .
106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg doses ) in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cul@@ arly , the intensity of se@@ dation was greater compared to that of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l alone .
the following adverse events were reported more frequently in clinical trials with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than under placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see section 5.1 ) :
the frequency of adverse events listed below is defined by the following criteria : frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
the following adverse events were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than under placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant adverse events ( * ) in clinical trials ( see Section 5.1 ) :
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study for 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
during the long @-@ term study lasting more than 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 18.@@ 2 % for patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for placebo treated patients .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and placebo with potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in routine laboratory parameters did not reveal any medi@@ cally significant differences .
enh@@ ancements of CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
adverse events related to anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy and their occurrence also reported in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l include malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and var@@ ic@@ osis , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mort@@ ality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) .
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al impair@@ ment was the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution associated with statisti@@ cally significant higher improvements of ag@@ gi@@ ti@@ bility / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and was similar to hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term study ( 24 h ) with 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as angi@@ op@@ ti@@ ghtness and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant greater improvement in symptoms of ag@@ gra@@ vation and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm .
the mean improvement from the initial value observed on the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score was 5.@@ 8 for placebo , 9.@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8,@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe ag@@ ility , a similar effectiveness has been observed in relation to the overall population , but a statistical significance could be determined on the basis of a reduced number of patients .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) at 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psycho@@ tic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled trial , 52 percent of respon@@ der patients who were attending the study were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % ( oral ) and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measurement scales , defined as secondary study goals , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg @-@ depression rate , showed a significantly stronger improvement than for hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study for 26 weeks in stabili@@ sed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) showed a significantly higher reduction in the rate of rel@@ ap@@ se , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % under placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ ici@@ an @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks that included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary focus was &apos; weight gain &apos; , an increase of at least 7 % compared with bas@@ eline ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca . ) .
111 In a placebo @-@ controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psycho@@ tic features which partially did not apply to lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l revealed a superior effectiveness in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study for 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study extension in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l during a stabili@@ zation phase before random@@ ization , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed superi@@ ority to the prevention of a bi@@ polar retreat , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia .
in the first 2 hours after in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular injection , the AU@@ C Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l AU@@ C is 90 % larger than the dose of the same dose as tablet ; the systemic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies with healthy volunteers the average time of plasma treatment was 1 to 3 hours after application .
the administration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution was well tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated dose in systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , which was in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular in 15@@ - or 5 times above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity after an intraven@@ ous application showed no safety @-@ related concerns after mat@@ ernal exposure , which was 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) for safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated dose , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data could not reveal any particular dangers to humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in doses or ex@@ positions which clearly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans ; therefore they have limited or no meaning for clinical use .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent by @-@ kidney toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pigment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 60 mg / kg / day ( 10 times the average steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
in addition , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis following the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l has been detected in the g@@ all of apes after repeated oral dose of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after doses that led to exposure of 3 and 11 times the intermediate steady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dosage .

the effectiveness of Abra@@ x@@ ane was investigated in a major study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , three quarters of which had received an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole administration or mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with a medication containing a conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
in total , 72 ( 31 % ) of 2@@ 29 patients with Abra@@ x@@ ane responded to the treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients who received conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medicines .
only those patients who were treated for the first time in metastatic breast cancer have no difference in the efficacy indicators such as time to wor@@ sen@@ ing disease and survival .
in contrast , patients receiving other treatment of their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el treatments .
it must also not be used in patients who have low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils in the blood before the treatment begins .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) found that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and that unlike other drugs , it should not be given to other medicines to reduce side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission issued a licence to the company Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast carcin@@ oma in patients with first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease and is not indicated for a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapy ( see also section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ ology &lt; 0.@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series .
in the case of sens@@ orial neu@@ rop@@ athy , the treatment must be interrupted until an improvement is reached on degree 1 or 2 , and the dose must be reduced in all subsequent cycles .
there is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adaptation in patients with mild to moderate liver function ( see Section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
there were no studies with patients with impaired ren@@ al function and there is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adaptation in patients with impair@@ ment of kidney function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data on harm@@ lessness and effectiveness .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an al@@ bum@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ article formulation of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el which could have significantly different pharmac@@ ological characteristics than other forms of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be removed immediately and a sympt@@ om@@ atic treatment is initiated , and the patient must not be treated again with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in patients no new ab@@ y@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated until the neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ur@@ ism increased again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te count rises again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver dysfunction ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
whereas a clearly marked cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity was not proven with Abra@@ x@@ ane , cardiac events in the indicated patient population are not unusual , especially in patients with previous anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease .
if nausea , vom@@ iting and diarr@@ ho@@ ea occur in patients after the administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane , these can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ etic and con@@ sti@@ lling methods .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used in pregnant women or women in child@@ bearing age , who do not practice effective contrac@@ eption , except for the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
women in child@@ bearing age should apply a reliable contrac@@ eption method during and up to 1 month after treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
male patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane will be advised to not witness during and up to six months after the treatment .
male patients should be advised of a sperm count prior to treatment , since the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as ti@@ redness ( very frequent ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) that may affect traffic and the ability to operate machinery .
listed below are the most common and most important incidents of adverse events reported in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast cancer , which were treated once every three weeks at 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the pi@@ vot@@ al clinical phase III study .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most prominent hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly reversible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ a@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
side effects listed in Table 1 are the adverse events associated with the administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy at each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1.000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) .
occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ tic de@@ hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased cre@@ atine in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ or@@ us in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood heart disease :

rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definite case in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimate of actual incidence is possible and no caus@@ al connection with these occur@@ ren@@ ces has been established .
Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an an@@ tim@@ i@@ kr@@ ot@@ ub@@ ules agent that promotes the consolidation of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ bu@@ le and stabili@@ ses the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules due to in@@ hibition of their poly@@ mer@@ isation .
this stabili@@ zation leads to an in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organisation of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that al@@ bum@@ in medi@@ ates the trans@@ y@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into endo@@ theli@@ al cells and in the framework of in @-@ vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of al@@ bum@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el by endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ do@@ corneal transport is medi@@ ated through the g@@ p @-@ 60 al@@ bum@@ in receptor and due to the al@@ b@@ umin@@ ous protein SP@@ ARC ( secre@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) , a pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation occurs in the area of the tumor .
the use of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data of 106 patients in two single @-@ arm un@@ f@@ aded studies and 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ized Phase III study .
in a study 43 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion about 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as in@@ fusion for about 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma .
this multic@@ entre study was conducted in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received a mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el every 3 weeks , either in the form of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as a 3 hour in@@ fusion with pre @-@ medication for preventing an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ medication ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
in the study , 64 % of patients had a com@@ promised general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases .
14 % of patients had previously not received chemotherapy , 27 % had only one adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metast@@ asis and 19 % due to metast@@ asis and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The results for the general response rate and time until progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving &gt; first @-@ line therapy are shown below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity compared to pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by improving one degree for patients who experienced peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy at a time during therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy to sound on bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and is still unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the total pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
exposure to active substances ( AU@@ C ) increased lin@@ early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml , analog@@ ous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After IV administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma at the recommended dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentration decreased in a multi @-@ phase mode .
the mean distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume points to far @-@ reaching ex@@ trav@@ ascular distribution and / or tissue binding of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study with advanced solid tum@@ ours , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared to intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane with the values following a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
the Clear@@ ance of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher ( 43 % ) after the Abra@@ x@@ ane dose ( 43 % ) than after a solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and the volume of distribution was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on in vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers , it is reported that Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is metaboli@@ zed primarily to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and to two smaller met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma , the mean value for cum@@ ulative ur@@ inary ex@@ cre@@ tion of the unchanged drug was 4 % of the given total dose of 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which points to far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clearance .
however , only a few data were available on patients at the age of more than 75 years , since only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .
chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in the original box and above light light over 8 hours .
Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic an@@ tic@@ ar@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic medicine and , as with other potentially toxic substances , should be taken care of when dealing with Abra@@ x@@ ane .

member states must ensure that the owner of the licence for placing on the market will provide medical personnel in di@@ aly@@ sis centers and retail stores with the following information and materials :
• Training Bro@@ ch@@ ure • Sum@@ m@@ ary of the characteristics of the drug ( specialist information ) , labelling and packaging inserts . • With clear visual representation of the correct application of the product provided cool@@ ers for transport through the patient .
this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a bio@@ drug that is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same active ingredient ( also called &quot; reference drug medicine &quot; ) .
it is used in patients with normal blood trans@@ fusion values , in which complications may occur in connection with blood trans@@ fusion , if a blood circulation is not possible before the procedure and a blood loss of 900 to 1,@@ 800 ml is expected .
treatment with Ab@@ y@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with illnesses for which the medicine is indicated .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make a blood donation , Ab@@ se@@ amed has been inj@@ ected into a vein .
the injection can also be carried out by the patient or his supervis@@ or , provided that they have received appropriate instructions .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency or in patients receiving chemotherapy , the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values should always be recommended ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron levels of all patients must be checked before treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency , and iron supplements should be administered during the entire treatment .
in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia may be caused by a ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ etal defect or that the body does not adequately respond to the body &apos;s ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thereby reduce the consequences of a loss of blood .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which it em@@ powers to the formation of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared as inj@@ ections into a vein as part of a major study involving 4@@ 79 patients suffering from kidney problems caused an@@ emia , compared with the reference drug .
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected into a v@@ ene for at least eight weeks before being either renamed to Ab@@ se@@ amed or continued receiving E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator for the efficacy was the change in ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of Ab@@ se@@ amed , inj@@ ected under the skin , were analysed with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o at 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy .
in the study with patients suffering from kidney problems caused an@@ a@@ emia , the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values of patients who were renamed to Ab@@ se@@ amed were the same as those who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison , the patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the starting value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of Ab@@ y@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which can occasionally lead to symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , stab@@ bing mig@@ raine like head@@ ache and confusion .
Ab@@ y@@ amed may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other ingredients .
Ab@@ y@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems as further studies are required to ensure that no allergic reactions are caused .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that , according to the European Union regulations , it has been proved that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company that manufactures ab@@ y@@ amed will provide information packages to healthcare professionals across all Member States , including information on the safety of the drug .
in August 2007 , the European Commission granted Medi@@ ce Medic@@ ines P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG a licence for the placing of Ab@@ se@@ amed in the entire European Union .
treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of trans@@ fusion needs in adults with solid tum@@ ours , malign@@ ant lymph@@ oma or multip@@ lier my@@ el@@ oma who receive chemotherapy and in which the risk of trans@@ fusion is due to the general condition ( such as cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing an@@ a@@ emia prior to chemotherapy ) .
treatment should be performed only in patients with moderate an@@ a@@ emia ( ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / l &#93; , no iron deficiency ) , if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or insufficient , in case of planned larger surgical procedures that require a large amount of blood ( 4 or more units of blood in men ; 5 or more units of blood in men ) .
for the reduction of foreign blood Ab@@ se@@ amed can be used prior to a large elec@@ tive orthop@@ edic intervention in adults with no iron deficiency , in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications can be expected .
H@@ B 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected drop of blood of 900 @-@ 1800 ml will be used , which cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program .
the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , except for pedi@@ atric patients , where the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease burden ; therefore , the evaluation of the individual clinical course and condition of disease by the physician is necessary .
an increase in ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values can be observed over or below the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration in a patient .
given this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be tried to achieve the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
if the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the persistent hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest permitted dosage required for control of an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ emia .
the clinical results suggest that patients with initial very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6@@ g / dl or &lt; 3,@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients with initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the clinical results suggest that patients with initial very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients with initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week using an intraven@@ ous application , if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should take place in steps of at least 4 weeks ) .
symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease burden ; therefore , the physician &apos;s assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of disease is necessary .
given this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be tried to achieve the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest permitted dosage required for controlling the an@@ a@@ emia .
if after 4 weeks of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the actual number of antibodies to ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the bas@@ eline value , the dose of 150 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week .
if the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in rise &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te figure of &lt; 40.000 cells / µ@@ l is increased compared to the bas@@ eline value , the dose should be increased to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week .
if after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value has increased by ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the number of antibodies to ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l , the dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week .
if the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value is increased by &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) resp@@ . the number of re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ tes increased by &lt; 40.000 cells / µ@@ l opposite the bas@@ eline value , a response to epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be abor@@ ted .
patients with mild an@@ a@@ emia ( ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) , in which the precau@@ tionary deposit of ≥ 4 blood @-@ preserved foods is required , Ab@@ se@@ amed should receive at a dose of 600 I.@@ U. / kg body weight twice weekly for 3 weeks before surgical procedure .
iron sub@@ stitution should be started as early as possible - e.g. a few weeks before the start of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program , so that large iron reserves are available before the beginning of the t@@ amed therapy .
6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ U. / kg of 10 consecutive days , on the day of surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards .
alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis through the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula needle , followed by 10 ml of is@@ ot@@ onic salt solution to rin@@ se the hose and ensure adequate injection of the drug in the circulation .
patients who suffer from the treatment with some ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ en@@ ie ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pl@@ asia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive a ab@@ y@@ stre@@ amed or another ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ster@@ en@@ ie ( see section 4.4 - ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ en@@ ia ) .
heart attack or stroke within one month before the treatment , un@@ stable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ sis ( e.g. an@@ am@@ nes@@ tically known ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ em@@ bo@@ lia ) .
the application of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in patients who are not able to participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program : severe cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ tery disease , peripheral arter@@ ial oc@@ clu@@ sion , vascular disease of the cardi@@ tis or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disorder ; in patients with recently occurred heart attack or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular event .
ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ en@@ ie ( PR@@ CA ) Very rare was reported about the occurrence of an antibody @-@ medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after months to long treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
in patients with sudden loss of activity , the reduction of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need of trans@@ fu@@ sions should be determined and the usual causes for a non @-@ contact ( iron , foli@@ c acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , aluminium pois@@ oning , infections or inflamm@@ ations , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) are examined .
if the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value , taking into account an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the Re@@ ti@@ co@@ cy@@ tes &quot; Index &quot; ) , is reduced ( &lt; 20.000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 0,5 % ) , the thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ tes and leu@@ k@@ oc@@ ytes are normal , and if no other cause of a loss is found , the anti @-@ ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin @-@ antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone mar@@ row for diagnosis of a PR@@ CA should be considered .
data on immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous usage of Ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk for an antibody induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ a@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 In patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the upper limit of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy .
in clinical trials , increased mort@@ ality risk and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed when ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis @-@ stimulating agents ( ESA ) were given with a ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of more than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit attributable to the administration of epo@@ e@@ ines , if the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration is increased by the concentration required to control the symptoms of an@@ emia and the prevention of blood trans@@ fusion .
the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in increase should be about 1 g / dl ( 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minim@@ ise the risk of increasing blood pressure .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and clin@@ ically evident cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion in@@ suffici@@ ency , maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration in maintenance therapy .
according to the time available , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which are not di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
in the case of tumour patients under chemotherapy , a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ fet@@ al and ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin @-@ response should be considered ( patients that may need to be trans@@ liter@@ ated ) .
if the H@@ b increase is exceeded than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a h@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted according to section 4.2 to minim@@ ise the risk of possible thro@@ mbo@@ tic events ( see section 4.2 treatment of patients with chemotherapy @-@ related an@@ emia - dosage adjustment with the aim of keeping the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision to apply re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk weighing involving the involvement of the respective patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
in patients who are intended for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery , if possible , prior to the beginning of epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly .
patients undergoing major elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery should receive appropriate thro@@ mbo@@ sis pro@@ phyla@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of thro@@ mbo@@ tic and vascular diseases , especially in case of underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , it cannot be ruled out that in the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with an initial hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value of &gt; 13 g / dl , an increased risk of postoperative thro@@ mbo@@ tic / vascular events can exist .
in several controlled trials , it was not proven for epo@@ e@@ tics to improve overall survival in tumor patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia or reduce the risk of tumour progression .
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy was returned if ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration was as@@ pi@@ red from 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.4 m@@ mo@@ l / l )
if epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in@@ dose should be adapted to the rising ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ rit .
in vitro studies on tumor tissues , there are no indications of interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F in relation to hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or proliferation .
thro@@ mbo@@ tic , vascular events such as m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial isch@@ a@@ emia , m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial isch@@ emia , cereb@@ ral thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis and 11 blood cl@@ ots .
the most frequent side @-@ effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or the deterioration of an existing hyper@@ tension .
increased incidence of thro@@ mbo@@ vascular events ( see Section 4.4 and section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients under treatment with ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ins .
regardless of ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment , surgical patients with cardiovascular disease can lead to thro@@ mbo@@ tic and vascular complications after repeated blood donations .
the genetically determined epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ sili@@ zed and is identical with the endo@@ genous human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , which was isolated from the urine of an@@ a@@ emia patients .
it could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulates ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and does not affect leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis .
3@@ 89 patients with ha@@ em@@ bla@@ st@@ oses ( 2@@ 21 multiple my@@ el@@ omes , 144 non @-@ H@@ od@@ g@@ kin &apos;s lymph@@ oma and 24 other ha@@ em@@ bla@@ st@@ oses ) and 3@@ 32 patients with solid tum@@ ours ( 172 breast cancer tum@@ ors , 23 lung cancer , 22 gastro@@ intestinal carcin@@ omas , 21 gastro@@ intestinal carcin@@ omas and 30 more ) .
1895 Pati@@ ents with solid tum@@ ours ( 6@@ 83 breast carcin@@ omas , 260 bron@@ chi@@ al cancer , 174 g@@ yn@@ a@@ ecological tum@@ ors , 300 gastro@@ intestinal tum@@ ors and 4@@ 78 others ) and 80@@ 2 patients with hem@@ ost@@ bla@@ st@@ oses .
survival and progression of tumour were examined in five major controlled trials involving 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled trials .
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and the control patients .
in these studies , patients with an@@ a@@ emia associated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin found a more consistent , statisti@@ cally significant higher mort@@ ality than in the controls .
overall survival in studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thro@@ mbo@@ sis and related complications in patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and in checks satisfactory .
there is an increased risk of thro@@ mbo@@ em@@ bo@@ lic events in tumour patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be ruled out .
it is not clear how far these results are applied to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in tumor patients who are treated with chemotherapy with the aim of achieving a ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value below 13 g / dl since too few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data .
epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa determin@@ ations after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of about 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a somewhat extended half @-@ life of approximately 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the serum levels of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are much lower than the serum levels obtained after an intraven@@ ous injection .
there is no accumulation : the serum levels remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first dose or 24 hours after the last gift .
bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation of chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency in humans and could be attributed to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
in a study of hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis patients treated three years with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , the incidence of bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis was not increased compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients who were not treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
14 In veter@@ inary studies with approximate 20@@ times of the recommended weekly dose , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa induced a reduced f@@ ec@@ al body weight , del@@ aying the oscill@@ ation and an increase in fet@@ al mort@@ ality .
these reports are based on in vitro diagnostics with cells from human tumor tissue samples , which are of uns@@ af@@ e Sig@@ ni@@ fi@@ kan@@ z for the clinical situation .
within the framework of an out@@ patient application , the patient can deposit Ab@@ se@@ amed once for a period of 3 days outside the fridge and not above 25 ° C .
the sy@@ ring@@ es are provided with gradu@@ ation rings and the filling volume is indicated by a glued label so that if necessary , the measurement of partial quantities is possible .

during the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed it can lead to a light dose @-@ dependent rise in the blood plat@@ el@@ et number within the normal range , which is re@@ trac@@ ted after further treatment .
your doctor may carry out regular blood tests if necessary to check the number of plat@@ el@@ ets on a regular basis during the first 8 weeks of the treatment .
iron deficiency , dis@@ solving of red blood cells ( hem@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 or foli@@ c acid deficiency , should be considered and treated before beginning of treatment with ab@@ y@@ amed .
very rare was reported about the occurrence of an antibody @-@ medi@@ ated ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ en@@ ia after months to long treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( spray @-@ inj@@ ected ) ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
if you suffer from ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ st@@ on@@ ia , it will ab@@ ort your therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed and determine how best treat your an@@ a@@ emia .
therefore , Ab@@ y@@ amed must be given through injection into a vein ( intraven@@ ously ) if you are treated for an an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease .
the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels could be increased and the risk of death could be increased .
with increased or rising potassium levels , your doctor may consider an inter@@ ruption of treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed until the potassium levels are back in the normal range .
if you suffer from chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically obvious cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion caused by insufficient heart rate , your doctor will make sure that your ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in mirror does not exceed a certain value .
according to the currently available findings , the treatment of an@@ emia with Ab@@ se@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which are not di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa administration and the desired effect should be considered for assessing the efficacy of Ab@@ y@@ amed .
200 Your doctor will regularly determine your levels of the red blood @-@ dy@@ e ( ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) and adjust your Ab@@ se@@ amed dose accordingly to minimize the risk of thro@@ mbo@@ sis ( thro@@ mbo@@ tic event ) .
this risk should be weigh@@ ed very carefully against the benefits derived from the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you are obes@@ e ( obes@@ e ) or if thro@@ mbo@@ tic vascular events have occurred in the past ( e.g. deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ sis or pneum@@ em@@ bo@@ li@@ sm ) .
in case you are cancer patient , remember that Ab@@ y@@ amed is like a growth factor for blood cells , and under certain circumstances can affect the tumour in a negative way .
if a larger orthop@@ edic surgery is im@@ min@@ ent to you , the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia should be examined before the beginning of the treatment and treated accordingly .
if your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) are too high , you should not get Ab@@ se@@ amed , as there is an increased risk of drop of blood after the surgery .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use / apply other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription medicine .
if you are taking C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means to supp@@ ress the immune system ) during your therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor may prescri@@ be certain blood tests to measure the blood level of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
laboratory studies have shown no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are means of building the immune system , such as cancer chemotherapy or HIV ) .
depending on how your blood arm ( an@@ emia ) refers to the treatment , the dose can be adapted approximately every four weeks until your condition is under control .
if necessary , your doctor will arrange regular blood tests to check the treatment success and ensure that the medicine works properly and your ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
as soon as you are well set , regular doses of Ab@@ se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg are given twice weekly , spread on two equally large inj@@ ections .
your doctor may prescri@@ be regular blood tests if necessary to verify the success of treatment and make sure that your ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ al value does not exceed a certain value .
depending on how an@@ a@@ emia refers to treatment , the dose can be adapted approximately every four weeks until the condition is under control .
to ensure that the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , the treating doctor will perform regular blood tests .
if it is necessary to shor@@ ten treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg may be given on 10 consecutive days before the surgery , on the day of surgery and another 4 days after the surgery .
however , if your doctor holds this for appropriate , you can also learn how to sp@@ lash Ab@@ se@@ amed yourself under the skin .
heart , heart attack , brain bleeding , stroke , cereb@@ ral thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , vascular diseases ( ane@@ ur@@ y@@ sm ) , thro@@ mbo@@ sis of the retina and blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys have been reported in patients under ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin therapy .
eyel@@ id and lips ( Qu@@ in@@ cke e@@ dem@@ a ) and shock @-@ like allergic reactions with symptoms such as ting@@ ling , redness , it@@ ching , heat sensation and accelerated heart rate were reported in rare cases .
ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ en@@ ia means that there are no longer enough red blood cells to be formed in the bone mar@@ row ( see section &quot; Special caution when using Ab@@ y@@ amed is required &quot; ) .
after repeated blood donations , there may be - regardless of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed - a blood gra@@ ft formation ( thro@@ mbo@@ tic vascular events ) .
treatment with Ab@@ y@@ amed may be associated with increased risk of blood @-@ thro@@ mbo@@ sis after surgery ( post @-@ operative thro@@ mbo@@ tic vascular events ) if your initial hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in is too high

Ac@@ up@@ a is used to treat the following diseases : oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after menop@@ ause and in men .
it is used in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( frac@@ tures ) , including patients who have recently suffered a short @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture as in H@@ infections ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with adult mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment ; prior to the first in@@ fusion , patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) or@@ ally or by injection into a muscle .
the administration of par@@ acet@@ amo@@ l or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( remedy against inflammation ) shortly after the application of Ac@@ credited can reduce the symptoms appearing in the three days following the in@@ fusion , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and head@@ ache .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ credited may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease .
as the active ingredient in Ac@@ up@@ a is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate Ac@@ last@@ a .
in the first study nearly 8 000 elderly women were involved with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of spine and hip frac@@ tures was investigated over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years who recently suffered a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures was investigated over a period of up to five years .
in the case of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ last@@ a was tested in two studies to a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months .
the main indicator of the efficacy was whether the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in serum ( an enzyme that breaks bone substance ) norm@@ alized in the blood or decreased by at least 75 % compared to bas@@ eline .
in the study with older women , the risk of spinal frac@@ tures in patients under Ac@@ last@@ a ( without other oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to those under placebo .
in comparison with all patients under Ac@@ last@@ a ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment ) with those under placebo the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % .
in the study involving men and women with hip frac@@ ture 9 % of the patients under Ac@@ last@@ a had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of those under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most of the A@@ last@@ a side effects occur within the first three days of in@@ fusion and are less frequent with repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
Ac@@ last@@ a may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any other ingredient .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients with ac@@ rob@@ a are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to in@@ fusion and oste@@ o@@ deficiency ( death of bone tissue ) in the jaw .
Ac@@ last@@ a manufactures information for physicians who prescri@@ be Ac@@ credited for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , which explains how to use the medicine , as well as similar material for patients in which the side effects of the medicine are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor .
in April 2005 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited to appro@@ ve the placing of Ac@@ count@@ a in the entire European Union .

oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment • for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recent low @-@ traum@@ atic frac@@ ture frac@@ ture .
for the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men , intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg ac@@ last@@ a is recommended once a year .
in patients with a low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a in@@ fusion is recommended two or more weeks after the operative care of the hip frac@@ ture ( see section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ credited should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after a treatment of the disease with Ac@@ last@@ a , a long period of re@@ mission was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is advisable to ensure an adequate intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get for at least 500 mg of elementary calcium per day for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a ( see paragraph 4.4 ) .
in patients with a low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the first Ac@@ last@@ a in@@ fusion .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a may be reduced by adding par@@ acet@@ amo@@ l or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen just after the application of Ac@@ last@@ a .
patients with kidney function disorder ( see Section 4.4 ) In patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min , Ac@@ last@@ a is not recommended as limited clinical experience is available for this patient group .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dosage adjustment is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients .
children and adolescents Ac@@ tivi@@ a are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age , as data on safety and effectiveness are missing .
Ac@@ last@@ a is not recommended in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , since only limited clinical experience exists for these patients .
pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia must be treated with sufficient intake of calcium and vitamin D before starting the therapy with Ac@@ last@@ a ( see Section 4.3 ) .
because of the rapid sett@@ ling of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid on bone structure , a temporary , sometimes sympt@@ om@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia may develop , whose maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of ac@@ las@@ a ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in addition , it is advisable to ensure an adequate intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get for at least 500 mg of elementary calcium per day for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , poor oral hygiene , should be examined before applying bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates with appropriate preventive dental treatment .
no data is available to patients who need dental interventions , whether the inter@@ ruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ opor@@ osis in the jaw@@ s .
clinical evaluation by the treating physician should be the basis for each patient &apos;s treatment plan and based on an individual benefit / risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after administration of Ac@@ last@@ a may be reduced by adding par@@ acet@@ amo@@ l or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen just after the application of Ac@@ last@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
the incidence of adverse event reported cases of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation was increased in patients receiving ac@@ rop@@ a ( 1,3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients receiving placebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in the oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ c@@ ture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) the total frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation between Ac@@ credited ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) adverse drug effects are listed in Table 1 .
ren@@ al function disorder ci@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid was associated with kidney function disorders that expressed itself as a decrease in kidney function ( i.e. an increase of serum carcin@@ in@@ in ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure .
the change in Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( measured annually before administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as limited ren@@ al function were compared with oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years compared to the placebo and placebo group .
a temporary increase in serum gu@@ inea f@@ law within 10 days after administration was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with placebo over 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic calcium values , which were below the normal fluctu@@ ation range ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , showed up to 21 % of the patients treated with Ac@@ last@@ a in a large clinical study compared to 21 % of the patients treated with Ac@@ last@@ a in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get trials .
all patients received supplementary sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis study , in the study to prevent post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study to avoid frac@@ tures after a hip frac@@ ture and in the disease @-@ Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) .
in the study on preventing clinical frac@@ tures after a recent hip frac@@ ture , the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reactions after the administration of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid in a large clinical study was reported on local reactions to the in@@ fusion site , such as redness , swelling and / or pain ( 0.@@ 7 % ) .
oste@@ o@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the or@@ tho@@ don@@ tic area was used , especially in cancer patients , about oste@@ o@@ ei@@ ro@@ sis ( primarily in the jaw area ) , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis , and most of the reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental interventions .
seven patients with 7.@@ 7@@ 36 patients showed an orth@@ on@@ ek@@ rose in the jaw area in one with Ac@@ last@@ a and in a placebo treated with placebo .
in case of over@@ dose which leads to clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , a compensation of calcium and / or intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate can be equ@@ ated .
clinical effectiveness in the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The effectiveness and safety of acet@@ yl@@ ation 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was indicated in post @-@ menop@@ aus@@ al women ( 7.@@ 7@@ 36 females aged 65 and 89 years ) with either a bone density correction ( BM@@ D ) or a BM@@ D @-@ T score for the fem@@ oral neck ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing verteb@@ ral frac@@ ture .
effects on morph@@ ometric spine frac@@ tures Ac@@ last@@ a decreased significantly over a period of three years as well as the frequency of one or more new verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures after one year ( see Table 2 ) .
Ac@@ last@@ a @-@ treated patients aged 75 years and older had a 60 % reduced risk of verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
effects on acet@@ yl@@ ation frac@@ tures showed an equally lasting effect over three years , resulting in a reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures in a 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) Ac@@ last@@ a significantly increased bone density in lum@@ bar spine , hip and dist@@ al radius compared to placebo treatment at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 Incre@@ ase of the bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the total hip by 6.0 % , the fem@@ oral neck around 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
bone hist@@ ology In 152 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with ac@@ rop@@ a ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) , bone biop@@ sies from the pel@@ vic crest were taken one year after the third annual dose of bone biop@@ sies .
in Ac@@ last@@ a , a micro@@ computer tom@@ ographic ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in the trab@@ ec@@ ul@@ ous bone volume compared to placebo and the receipt of the trab@@ ec@@ ul@@ ous bone architecture .
bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ termin@@ ale pro@@ pe@@ p@@ tide of type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and the beta @-@ C tel@@ op@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were determined in sub @-@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 24@@ 6 patients in perio@@ dic intervals during the duration of the study .
the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose ac@@ last@@ a reduced B@@ SAP significantly by 30 % after 12 months compared to bas@@ eline and was held at 28 % below the bas@@ eline value up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the bas@@ eline value up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 55 % below the bas@@ eline value up to 36 months .
vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received a starting dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of or@@ ally or in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion .
total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with Ac@@ last@@ a compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effects on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study , the Ac@@ up@@ a treatment increased the BM@@ D compared to placebo treatment at all time points .
Ac@@ up@@ a treatment led to an increase in BM@@ D by 5.4 % over 24 months compared to placebo treatment and 4.3 % on the neck neck .
clinical effectiveness in men In H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study 5@@ 08 men were random@@ ized and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was assessed after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the frequency of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in Ac@@ last@@ a @-@ treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % in placebo .
in another study in males ( Study CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M2@@ 30@@ 8 ) the once annual administration of Ac@@ last@@ a was not inferior to the once weekly administration of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate related to the percentage change in the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ e BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the bas@@ eline value .
clinical effectiveness of the treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone Ac@@ last@@ a was examined in patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ologically confirmed , especially light to moder@@ ately heavy mor@@ bus paste of the bone ( mean serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in accordance with 2.@@ 6@@ x to 3.0 times higher than normal value when inclusion in the study ) .
11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in comparison to the intake of 30 mg of ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once daily during 2 months was demonstrated in two six months comparison studies .
in the combined results , a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain influence was observed after 6 months compared to the bas@@ eline value for Ac@@ last@@ a and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
patients who were classified as Respon@@ der at the end of the six @-@ month main study ( responded to the therapy ) could be included in an observation phase .
from 143 with Ac@@ last@@ a and 107 patients treated with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate , the therapeutic response to 141 of the patients treated with Ac@@ last@@ a , compared with 71 of the patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate , could be maintained at an average duration of the observation period of 18 months after application .
in@@ fusion of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of c@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , which proved to be a dose @-@ independent .
then the plasma gas rose rapidly to &lt; 10 % of the top value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h followed by a long phase very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
rapid bi@@ pha@@ sic disappearance from the large cycle with half @-@ life t ½ α to 0,@@ 24 and t ½ β 1.@@ 87 hours , followed by a long period of exclusion with a terminal elimination period t ½ g 146 hours .
the early stages of distribution ( α and β , with the above 3 ½ values ) presumably represent rapid res@@ or@@ ption in the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion over the kidneys .
in the first 24 hours 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose can be found in the urine while the rest is mainly bon@@ ded to bone tissue .
the total body @-@ Clear@@ ance is 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h independently of the dose and remains unaffected by gender , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion period from 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease of the tin @-@ acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration at time ) .
a reduced clearance of the metaboli@@ zed by cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom @-@ P@@ 450 @-@ enzyme systems is unlikely , because z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is not metaboli@@ zed in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , substance @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ -
special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid cor@@ related with the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , and was 84 ± 29 ml / min in the 64 examined patients ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
this results in an easy ( cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a regular ren@@ al function disorder right down to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance up to 35 ml / min no can adjustment of the c@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid required .
as for severe kidney function disorder ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only limited data is available , no statements are possible for this population .
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ le@@ thal intraven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight in mice and rats 0,@@ 6 mg / kg body weight .
in the case of studies on dogs , single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on the AU@@ C , thre@@ ef@@ old the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) were administered over a period of 15 minutes , well and without a ren@@ al influence .
chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In trials with intraven@@ ous application , the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid was determined in rats by doses of 0.@@ 6 mg / kg in 3 @-@ day intervals , administered in intervals of 2 - 3 weeks ( a cum@@ ulative dose that corresponds to the 7@@ times of human @-@ therapeutic exposure to AU@@ C ) .
in long @-@ term studies with repeated use at cum@@ ulated ex@@ positions , which exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects appeared in other organs , including the gastro@@ intestinal tract and the liver , as well as at the intraven@@ ous injection point .
the most common findings in repeated use was an increased primary Spon@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ ap@@ hy@@ sis of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all doses , an infection which reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti @-@ absor@@ p@@ tive action of the substance .
rats observed a ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in doses from 0.2 mg / kg as external and internal ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such a skel@@ eton .
no ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ ic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed on rab@@ bits , although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity of 0.1 mg / kg was pronounced as a result of a low serum @-@ calcium level .

z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is a substance class agent called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , and is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the Pa@@ get &apos;s disease .
declining blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ ro@@ gens made from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men .
with the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , the bone structure becomes too fast , and new bone material is built un@@ ordered , which makes the bone material weaker than normal .
Ac@@ last@@ a works by re@@ vit@@ alizing bone reconstruction , ensuring normal bone formation and thus rein@@ forces the bone .
if you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery , tell your doctor that you are treated with Ac@@ last@@ a .
when using Ac@@ last@@ a with other medicines Please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you use / apply other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription medicine .
it is especially important for your doctor to know if you are taking drugs , of which it is known that they are damaging the kidneys .
when using Ac@@ last@@ a together with food and drink , you are concerned that according to your doctor &apos;s instructions , you have sufficient liquid before and after the treatment with Ac@@ last@@ a .
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year , which is administered by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion in a vein .
if you recently broke the hip , it is recommended to take Ac@@ last@@ a two or more weeks after surgical removal of the hip frac@@ ture .
the usual dose is 5 mg administered by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion in a vein .
since Ac@@ last@@ a is active for a long time , you may need a further dose only after one year or more .
it is important to follow these instructions precisely so that the calcium level in your blood is not too low in time after in@@ fusion .
with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ last@@ a can work longer than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a re @-@ treatment .
if the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a has been missed , please contact your doctor or hospital immediately to arrange a new appointment .
before ending treatment with Ac@@ last@@ a Falls , consider the termination of treatment with Ac@@ last@@ a , please check your next doctor &apos;s appointment and discuss it with your doctor .
adverse events related to the first in@@ fusion occur very frequently ( in more than 30 % of patients ) , but are less frequent after the ensu@@ ing in@@ fusion .
fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and head@@ ache , occur within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ credited .
at present , it is unclear whether Ac@@ credited will cause this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should report it to your doctor if you notice such symptoms when you have received Ac@@ last@@ a .

about allergic reactions , including rare cases of respiratory problems , hi@@ ves and angi@@ o@@ e@@ dem@@ a ( such as swelling in the face , tongue or throat ) , has been reported .
please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if any of the side effects listed will significantly affect you or notice any side effects that are not listed in this information .
if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions until the application ; usually 24 h at 2 ° C to 8 ° C are not exceeded .
in patients with a low @-@ traum@@ atic frac@@ ture frac@@ ture the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ last@@ a is recommended two or more weeks after the operative care of the hip frac@@ ture .
before and after the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a , patients need to be sufficiently supplied with liquid ; this is particularly important in patients receiving di@@ ure@@ tic therapy .
because of the quick sett@@ ling of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid on bone structure , a temporary , sometimes sympt@@ om@@ atically running , hypo@@ kal@@ emia develops , whose maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of ac@@ las@@ a .
in addition , it is advisable to ensure an adequate intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , at least twice a day , 500 mg elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a .
in patients with a low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture a starting dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ credited .

in addition , four studies were carried out to over 7@@ ,000 patients in which compli@@ a was used as a suppor@@ tive drug to stop smoking .
the studies on the setting of the smoking did not show uniform results , so the effect of accompli@@ a in this field of application was difficult to assess .
the most common side effects of accompli@@ a that were observed during the studies ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) were Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) and upper respiratory infections .

summary of the EP@@ P for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Safety Report ( EP@@ P ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) has evaluated the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( in particular over@@ weight patients ) in which met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes drug ) is not indicated .
it can be used in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( in particular over@@ weight patients ) that cannot be satisfactory with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest tolerated dose .
in combination with sul@@ fon@@ yl res@@ inous or insulin , the previous dose of sul@@ phon@@ yl res@@ inous or insulin may be maintained with the beginning of the treatment , except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; this should reduce the dose of sul@@ phon@@ yl alcohol or insulin .
this means that the body &apos;s insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases , whereby type 2 diabetes can be better adjusted .
in more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of Ac@@ tos in tri@@ ple@@ therapy was investigated ; in addition , the patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ phon@@ yl res@@ inous , in addition they were either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years .
in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , indicating how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tos has led to a reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which causes blood sugar levels to be reduced in doses of 15 mg , 30 mg , and 45 mg .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of the additional administration of Ac@@ tos for existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and sul@@ fon@@ yl res@@ ins showed a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional dose of placebo led to a decrease of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study where the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin was examined in 28@@ 9 patients , patients who took Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin reported a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared with 0.@@ 14 % in patients receiving placebo .
the most common side effects associated with Ac@@ tos were visual disturbances , upper respiratory tract infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ thesis ( reduced sensitivity to stim@@ uli ) .
Ac@@ tos may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or any of the other ingredients , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high ket@@ one level - acid levels - in the blood ) .
it was decided that Ac@@ tos should serve as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients with met@@ form@@ in , as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in .
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted the company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited to appro@@ ve the placing of Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , curved and carry on one side the mark &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin and is un@@ suitable for met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see paragraph 4.4 ) .
there are no data available for the use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age , so the application is not recommended in this age group .
in patients who are at risk of developing at least one risk factor ( e.g. past cardiac inf@@ ar@@ ction or sympt@@ om@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually .
patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or o@@ e@@ dem@@ a , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve .
patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain , and o@@ e@@ dem@@ a when pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin .
cardiovascular at@@ come study with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under the age of 75 with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mak@@ rov@@ ascular illness was performed .
this study showed an increase in heart failure reports , but this did not lead to an increase in mort@@ ality in the study .
in patients with increased initial liver enzymes ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one may not be used .
if the AL@@ T mirror is increased to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enzymes are to be checked again as soon as possible .
if a patient develops symptoms which indicate a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , abdominal pain , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark urine , the liver enzymes are to be checked .
the decision , whether the treatment of the patient with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one continues , should be pres@@ ided by clinical app@@ rais@@ al until the laboratory parameters are found .
in clinical studies with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been demonstrated , which can be stir@@ red by fatty deposits and is associated with fluid retention in some cases .
a slight reduction of mean ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) occurred as a result of h@@ emo@@ di@@ lution .
similar changes were observed in comparative controlled studies with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 3.6 @-@ 4.1 % ) and to a lesser extent in patients suffering from sul@@ fon@@ yl resin and insulin ( relative reduction in ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 1 @-@ 2 % and ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients who receive pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one as oral or triple @-@ combination therapy with a sul@@ fon@@ y@@ otrop@@ ic or as two @-@ layer combination therapy with insulin receive the risk of dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
after the market launch , a reduction in visual acuity was reported in thi@@ az@@ ol@@ d@@ indi@@ a , including pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , a occurrence or wor@@ sen@@ ing of diabe@@ tic mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a .
it is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and the occurrence of mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a , but con@@ don@@ ating physicians should be aware of the possibility of a mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a if patients report about disorders of visual acuity ; a suitable ophthal@@ m@@ ological examination should be considered .
in a summary analysis of adverse events related to frac@@ tures from random@@ ised controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one
calculated frac@@ tures tot@@ aled 1,@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years at the women treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative study .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures of 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one were compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative study .
patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy , and if a patient desires a pregnancy or this happens , the treatment is to be stopped ( see Section 4.6 ) .
studies on the interactions have shown that pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one does not have any relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
interactions with medicines that are metaboli@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium channel block@@ ers and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not expected .
the simultaneous use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one by 3 times .
the simultaneous use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a reduction in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one by 54 % .
this is due to the fact that the treatment with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduces the fet@@ al insulin resistance and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal by reducing the availability of the metabolic substrates for fet@@ al growth .
very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequently &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , individual cases : unknown ( not estim@@ able from this data ) .
these lead to a temporary change in the tur@@ g@@ or and the index index of the lens , as observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic agents .
in clinical trials with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one AL@@ T asc@@ ents beyond the tri@@ ples of the upper limit of the normal range were often found as under placebo , however more rarely than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ yl resin .
in an outcome study in patients with advanced mak@@ rov@@ ascular disease , the incidence of severe con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure under pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was 1.6 % higher than placebo , if pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or placebo .
since the market launch , in@@ suffici@@ ency was rarely reported under pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , but more often when pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
a summari@@ zing analysis of adverse events in bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in the groups treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and over 7,@@ 400 patients in the treated groups treated with comparative media .
in the Pro@@ Active study conducted over a period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparative study .
if the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day lasted for four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days no symptoms appeared .
pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one appears to function by activating specific core recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ation activated Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ γ ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) ) , which leads to an increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells in the animal model .
it could be demonstrated that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduces the production of glu@@ cos@@ amine in the liver and increases the peripheral glu@@ cos@@ ever@@ sion in the event of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ zid as mon@@ otherapy was carried out over two years to investigate time until after the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
at the time of two years after the beginning of the therapy a blood glucose control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) could be maintained by pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of the patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ zid ) .
in a placebo controlled trial for over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was insufficient with insulin despite three months of optimization , were random@@ ized to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or placebo .
in patients under pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.@@ 45 % compared to those who continue to receive insulin ; a reduction in insulin dosage in the group treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was observed .
in clinical trials over a year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the al@@ bum@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ratio was statisti@@ cally significant compared to bas@@ eline values .
the effect of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was examined in a small study of type 2 diabetes patients on 18 weeks .
in most clinical trials compared to placebo , a reduction in total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels as well as slight but clin@@ ically not significantly elevated LD@@ L cholesterol levels have been observed .
in clinical studies over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduced the total plas@@ mat@@ yl@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids in comparison to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or g@@ lic@@ la@@ zid and increased the HD@@ L Cholester@@ insp@@ iegel .
compared to placebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in LD@@ L cholesterol was detected in Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , whereas lower levels of met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ zid were observed .
in a study more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduced not only the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , but also improved the post @-@ pran@@ dial elevated tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , both on the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride concentrations and the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride synthesis .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular outcome study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced pharmac@@ ological disease were random@@ ized to receive either Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years .
after oral use pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is absorbed quickly , with the peak concentrations of un@@ altered pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in plasma usually 2 hours after application .
this is based on the contribution of M @-@ IV to the effectiveness of about three times the effectiveness of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal .
in interaction studies it has been proven that pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one does not have any relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
simultaneous use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) or with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) increases respectively lowers the plasma concentration of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( see Section 4.5 ) .
after oral use of radio@@ actively marked pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in humans , the constra@@ int was found mainly in the waste ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) .
the mean plasma elimination round of un@@ altered pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans , and all active met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites are 16 - 23 hours .
plasma concentrations of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects , but the rates of oral Clear@@ ance resem@@ ble the mother substance .
in toxic@@ ological studies occurred in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys in accordance with repeated administration plasma volume enlargement with h@@ emo@@ di@@ lution , an@@ emia and reversible ec@@ centric heart hyper@@ tro@@ phy .
this is due to the fact that the treatment with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduces the fet@@ al insulin resistance and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal by reducing the availability of the metabolic substrates for fet@@ al growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) increased incidence of hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( in male and female rats ) and tum@@ ours ( in male rats ) of the ur@@ inary bladder was induced .
in an animal model of the family aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) , the treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ es led to an increased frequency of col@@ ont@@ um@@ ours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and on one side mark &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 30 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
calculated frac@@ tures tot@@ aled 1,@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years at the women treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative study .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures of 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one were compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative study .
in another study over two years the effects of combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in were examined with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or g@@ lic@@ la@@ zid .
in clinical trials over 1 year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the al@@ bum@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ratio was statisti@@ cally significant compared to bas@@ eline values .
in a study of 20 weeks Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduced not only the N@@ ü@@ chtern tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post @-@ pran@@ dial elevated tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , this has an effect on the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride absorption as well as the h@@ ep@@ atic Tr@@ y@@ gli@@ z@@ eri@@ d synthesis .
although the study lack@@ ed the goal of its primary end@@ point , which constituted a combination of total mort@@ ality , non @-@ fatal m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome , leg amp@@ utation above the ank@@ le , cor@@ on@@ ary rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization and re@@ vis@@ ing of the leg arter@@ ies , suggests that the intake of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one does not involve cardiovascular long @-@ term risks .

Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane was examined in 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes in which the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes , where the body is unable to effectively use insulin .
in the study , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured after 12 weeks , indicating how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror , suggest@@ ing that the blood sugar level was similarly severe as with another human insulin analog .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may be suscep@@ tible to hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , the doses of ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane may be adapted when administered together with a number of other medicines which may affect blood sugar ( the complete list is to be found in the package insert ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane over@@ lap the risks in the treatment of diabetes .
in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a licence to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for placing ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the entire European Union .
pre @-@ mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice daily , if a quick initial action is desired along with a lasting effect .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose was inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood sugar level is significantly improved by intensified insulin therapy , the hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia warning symptoms can be modified and should be advised accordingly .
any change regarding thickness , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ pha@@ sic , long acting insulin , etc . ) , insulin type ( animal insulin , human insulin or insulin analogue ) and / or manufacturing method ( through re@@ combin@@ ant DNA against insulin of animal origin ) can cause a change in the dosage required .
if a dosage adjustment is required when switching to ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane , this may be necessary at the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic reactions after changing animal to human insulin reported that early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin .
before travelling , which go over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor since such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times .
the doctor must take account of possible interactions during the treatment and always ask his patients for other medicines that they have taken .
4 If hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia as well as hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , which may occur in a non @-@ controlled diabetes therapy , increase the risk of ab@@ norm@@ alities and fertility in uter@@ o .

hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia can develop gradually : • Easy hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia can be treated by oral intake of glucose or sug@@ ary foods .
diabe@@ tics should always have grape varieties , sweets , bis@@ cuits or sug@@ ary fruit juice . • Seri@@ ous hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias with un@@ consciousness are treated with an in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) or glucose that is intraven@@ ously given by the doctor .
the effect begins within half an hour , the maximum maximum is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the duration of the operation lasts up to 24 hours .
res@@ or@@ ption The absorption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed absorption .
a number of spl@@ itting ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) places on the human insulin molecule were taken into consideration ; none of the met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites formed by the division is active .
based on conventional safety har@@ mac@@ ology studies , toxic@@ ity in repeated dose , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot reveal any particular dangers to humans .

in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a licence to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the placing of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the entire European Union .
when two types of insulin are mixed , the amount of insulin quickly acting must first be raised , followed by the amount of the long @-@ acting insulin .
3 If a dosage adjustment is required when switching to ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the patient , it may be necessary at the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
before travelling , which go over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor since such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times .

a clinical trial in an intensive care unit for the treatment of hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( blood sugar over 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) with 204 diabe@@ tic and 13@@ 44 non @-@ diabe@@ tic patients , who underwent major surgical procedures , showed that a reduced mort@@ ality reduced by 42 % ( 8 % compared to 4.6 % ) by intraven@@ ously given Ac@@ ro@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( blood sugar 4.4 - 6.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the effect begins within half an hour , the maximum maximum is reached within 1.5 to 3.5 hours and the total duration amounts to approximately 7 to 8 hours .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id was studied at a smaller number ( n = 18 ) diabe@@ tic children ( aged between 6 and 12 years ) and adolescents ( aged 13 to 17 years ) .
the data is limited , but suggests that pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in children and adolescents is similar to that of adults .

aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients already showing signs of crystalline deposits , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or arthritis ( &quot; stones &quot; i.e. larger urine fragments that can lead to joint and bone damage ) .
if the ur@@ ic acid level is still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day .
during the first treatment months still g@@ out attacks may occur ; therefore , it is recommended that patients take at least during the first six months of treatment with aden@@ ur@@ ic and other medicines to prevent g@@ out attacks .
the medicine is not recommended in children and for patients who had an organ transplan@@ t as it was not examined for these groups .
in the first study , participating in 1 0@@ 72 patients , the efficacy of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared to placebo ( hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ) and Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine used to treat hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) .
in the second study , two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of 300 mg once a day ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid level in the blood was below 6 mg / dl in the last three measurements .
in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of patients who took 80 mg once daily , and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of patients who took 120 mg once a day in the last three measurements , had a ur@@ ic acid level in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl .
in comparison , this was the case with 22 % ( 60 out of 26@@ 8 ) of patients under allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and in none of the 134 patients under placebo .
the most common side effects of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , diarr@@ hea , nausea ( nausea ) , rash and abnormal liver values .
in particular , in patients with heart problems in pre @-@ history , there may be an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering the ur@@ ic acid level in the blood than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects related to heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia in diseases that have already led to deposits ( including one out of the medical history known or current g@@ out node and / or arthritis ) .
if the ser@@ pent@@ ine acid level is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a can increase on AD@@ EN@@ NA@@ IC 120 mg 1 x can be considered daily .
for patients with severe ren@@ al function restriction , efficacy and safety have not been fully investigated until now ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) .
children and adolescents since there are no experiences in children and adolescents , the use of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ st@@ at is not recommended in this group of patients .
organ transplan@@ t recipients As there is no experience in transplan@@ t recipients , the use of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ st@@ at is not recommended in this group of patients ( see Section 5.1 ) .
cardiovascular disease In patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or abnormal heart failure , treatment with F@@ eb@@ ux@@ st@@ at is not recommended ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
as with other har@@ n@@ sow@@ ing medicines , acute g@@ out attacks may occur during the course of treatment because of the reduction in serum retinal acid pi@@ eg@@ els , ur@@ ic acid deposits can be mobili@@ zed in the tissue .
B. in malign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han &apos;s syndrome , the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine is so far in rare cases that a de@@ position in the ur@@ inary tract occurs .
liver disorders Dur@@ ing phase 3 clinical trials , slight ab@@ norm@@ alities of liver function values were observed in patients treated with F@@ eb@@ ux@@ st@@ at ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to perform liver function test before beginning of the f@@ eb@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ ment and in the further course depending on clinical findings ( see section 5.1 ) .
the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line Z@@ hadn &apos;t performed any interaction studies on F@@ eb@@ ux@@ st@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O in@@ hibition can lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line level ( an in@@ hibition of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line metabolism was also reported for other X@@ O @-@ inhibit@@ ors ) .
in subjects , the simultaneous administration of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ st@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen 250 mg 2 x was associated with an increase in F@@ eb@@ ux@@ o @-@ exposure ( C@@ MA@@ X 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .
in clinical trials , the use of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not related to a clin@@ ically significant increase in adverse events .
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / hydro@@ chlor@@ oth@@ i@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in F@@ eb@@ ux@@ focus can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in , without the need for a dosage adjustment for f@@ eb@@ ux@@ st@@ ate or the other active ingredient .
in a study with subjects , 120 mg of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x daily showed an average 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 medium , indicating a possible weak inhibit@@ or effect of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ st@@ at on the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo .
ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that the simultaneous consumption of an ant@@ acid which contains magnesium hydro@@ x@@ ide and aluminum hydro@@ x@@ ide , delays the absorption of f@@ eb@@ ux@@ st@@ at ( about 1 hour ) and reduces the C@@ MA@@ X by 32 % , but does not cause any significant change in the AU@@ C .
pregnancy data over a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ ancies can not be limited to side effects of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ st@@ at on pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born .
animal experimental studies do not include direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) .
patients should be careful when controlling a vehicle , operating machines or in the exercise of hazardous activities until they can reasonably be certain that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC does not adver@@ sely affect their performance .
a numer@@ ically higher incidence of the results reported by the investig@@ ator was observed in the overall f@@ eb@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ ect@@ group in Phase 3 ( 1,3 versus 0.3 events per 100 patient years ) and in long @-@ term extension studies ( 1.4 versus 0.@@ 7 events per 100 patient years ) although no statistical significant differences were found and no caus@@ al relationship with F@@ eb@@ ux@@ st@@ at could be detected .
the risk factors determined in these patients were arter@@ ios@@ clerosis and / or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or abnormal heart failure in the medical history .
frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) side effects that could be associated with the medicine and which were reported more than once in all F@@ eb@@ ux@@ st@@ at treatment groups , are listed below .
diarr@@ ho@@ ea , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients who are treated with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ ine at the same time . * * In clinical trials no serious ras@@ hes or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions have been observed .
7 Open long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies 9@@ 06 patients up to 1 year were treated , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients up to 4 years treated with F@@ eb@@ ux@@ st@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg .
the events related to long @-@ term extension studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see Table 1 ) .
the following treatment @-@ related events were reported in all F@@ eb@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ - treatment groups altogether more than once and occurred in patients receiving f@@ eb@@ ux@@ st@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient @-@ years ) , according to indications .
the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported in the pi@@ v@@ ot studies phase 3 for these doses or with a lower frequency :

effective mechanism of ur@@ ic acid is the final product of pur@@ ine metabolism in humans and arises in the context of the reaction @-@ as@@ k@@ ade hypo@@ x@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin → ur@@ ic acid .
F@@ eb@@ ux@@ st@@ at is a potent , non @-@ pur@@ ine @-@ selective inhibit@@ or of the X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ x@@ O ) with a K@@ i value for in vitro in@@ hibition that lies below the nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar range .
clinical trial results The effectiveness of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two pi@@ v@@ ot studies of Phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were performed with 1,@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia and g@@ out .
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in every study the proportion of patients in which the last three month @-@ specific serum res@@ ection levels &lt; 6,@@ 0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) were .
placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ NA@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ NA@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ NAL 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 25@@ 8 ) for patients with a serum incre@@ ment value at beginning of study of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2 mg / dl .
the AP@@ EX study showed a statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority in the treatment of AD@@ EN@@ NA@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ NA@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conven@@ tionally used doses of al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed a statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority in the treatment of AD@@ EN@@ NA@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ NA@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to treatment with the conven@@ tionally used dose of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .
patients with serum incre@@ at@@ in@@ values &gt; 1.5 and ≤ 2 mg / dl ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 50@@ 9 ) were combined for analysis . * p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versus Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , # p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versus 80 mg
the reduction in serum res@@ aw rate to &lt; 6,@@ 0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the visit to the doctor in week 2 and permanently maintained over the entire treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received al@@ um@@ lau@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum incre@@ mental values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2,0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ren@@ al function The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy in 40 patients with ren@@ al function restriction ( i.e. D ) .
with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC the primary efficacy end@@ point was 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage return of serum res@@ ins in subjects , irrespective of kidney function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney function disorders ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum res@@ ins concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( bas@@ eline ) had a serum aspir@@ ation concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
the data from the Phase 3 open extension study showed that the permanent reduction of the ser@@ um@@ ina acid levels to &lt; 6@@ mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) showed a decrease in incidence of g@@ out attacks ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients did not require treatment against a ra@@ ke ) .
this was associated with a reduction in the size of the g@@ out node , resulting in 54 % of the patients a complete disappearance of the g@@ out nodes up to 24 .
increased TS@@ H values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients receiving long @-@ term treatment with F@@ eb@@ ux@@ st@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients receiving Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in open long @-@ term extension studies ( see paragraph 4.4 ) .

for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase in AU@@ C is observed for F@@ eb@@ ux@@ st@@ at , which is larger than the dose @-@ proportional rise .
after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ MA@@ X amounts to about 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant change was observed in the percentage decline in serum res@@ id@@ n@@ aci@@ al concentration , provided that this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The seem@@ ing ste@@ ady state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) from F@@ eb@@ ux@@ st@@ at lies in the range from 29 to 75 l after intake of doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma release of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ st@@ at amounts to around 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary binding to al@@ bum@@ in ) and is consistent across the concentration width achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disorder where the bones are br@@ ittle ) in women after menop@@ ause where there is a risk of low vitamin D levels .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other drugs ( including an@@ ta@@ zi@@ da , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
in order to avoid irrit@@ ation of the o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , the patient must not lie down until after the first food intake of the day , which should take place 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
as al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D@@ 3 are already being used separately in pharmaceuticals that are approved in the European Union , the Company presented data originating from previous studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study with 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to verify the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE concerning the increase in vitamin D levels .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE was lower ( 11 % ) than those who only took al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( 32 % ) .
the company also submitted data suggest@@ ing that the al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is exactly the dose required to prevent bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pains of the muscul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive system , such as abdominal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( diarr@@ hea ) , fl@@ atten@@ ing , dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia ( swal@@ lowing ) , tri@@ mm@@ ed abdom@@ en ( blo@@ ated abdom@@ en ) and aci@@ dic pit@@ ching .
in patients with hyper@@ sensitivity to al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D@@ 3 or any of the other ingredients AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE cannot be applied .
it must not be used in case of diseases of the es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low levels of calcium ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit upright for at least 30 minutes .
in January 2007 , the European Commission granted Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd. to appro@@ ve the transport of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE within the European Union .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE can be taken only with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
the following indications are to be observed precisely to reduce the risk of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and associated side effects ( see paragraph 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swal@@ lowed once the day with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • The patients should not ch@@ ew the tablet or leave the tablet in the mouth , as there is a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a . • The patients should not lie before the first food intake of the day that should take 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
B. pe@@ p@@ tic ul@@ cer@@ ation , active gastro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract compared to p@@ yl@@ or@@ op@@ last@@ y , only be given special caution ( see Section 4.3 ) .
es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al responses , such as es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al stro@@ kes , were reported in patients under the intake of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( partly these were severe and required a hosp@@ itali@@ zation ) .
the doctor should therefore draw attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , and patients should be advised to susp@@ end the appearance of symptoms of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation such as dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , pain in swal@@ lowing or res@@ o@@ yst@@ al pain or new or wor@@ sen@@ ing heart@@ burn ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
3 The risk of severe es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or continue taking other symptoms after the occurrence of symptoms indic@@ ative of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
whereas in large @-@ scale clinical studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at no increased risk was detected , stomach and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a , including some severe and with complications , were reported ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
oste@@ o@@ deficiency of the jaw , commonly associated with tooth extraction and / or local infection ( including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose therapeutic regi@@ men mainly contain intraven@@ ous bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate .
there are no data available which indicates whether bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy is reduced in patients who need a s@@ late surgical procedure , reducing the risk of oste@@ opor@@ osis of the jaw .
the clinical evaluation by the treating physician is decisive for the treatment plan in each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instructed that when taking a AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE dose they should take the tablet next morning after having noticed their failure .
you should not take two tablets the same day , but continue taking one tablet per week as originally planned on the day of the week intended for it .
other diseases affecting the metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be adequately treated before beginning of therapy with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines can interfere with the res@@ or@@ ption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at when taken at the same time .
therefore , after taking al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , patients must wait at least 30 minutes before taking other drugs ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not performed , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken in clinical trials together with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines without clin@@ ically relevant interactions .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only intended for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore neither used during pregnancy nor lac@@ t@@ ating women .
animal studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate do not indicate directly damaging effects with regard to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
oste@@ o@@ deficiency of the jaw was reported in patients with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most reports stem from cancer patients , but also in oste@@ opor@@ osis patients .
however , serum cal@@ ci@@ ums decreased to &lt; 8.0 mg / dl ( 2,0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and serum phosph@@ ats up to &lt; 2.0 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) in both treatment groups with a similar frequency .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at In@@ follow an oral over@@ dose may occur hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ re@@ mia and side effects in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ga@@ stri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a .

fit consisted of two plac@@ ebo@@ ards controlled by al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate daily ( 5 mg daily for 2 years and then 10 mg a day either over 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study , the daily dose of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate reduced the occurrence of at least one new verteb@@ rate frac@@ ture by 47 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 7.@@ 9 % compared with placebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .
following an intraven@@ ous reference dose , the average oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in women was 0.@@ 64 % for doses between 5 and 70 mg after ni@@ ghtly fasting and two hours before recording a standardised breakfast .
bio@@ availability decreased accordingly to about 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % if al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was taken half an hour before a standardised breakfast .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day .
in healthy subjects , the administration of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily for five days ) resulted in no clin@@ ically significant change in the oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at ( increase in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 distribution studies in rats have shown that after an intraven@@ ous dose of 1 mg / kg , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is distributed temporarily in tissue tissues after an intraven@@ ous dose of 1 mg / kg , but then quickly disper@@ sed into the bone or ex@@ cre@@ ted with urine .
ex@@ cre@@ tion After IV administration of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate about 50 % of the radioactive substance extracted within 72 hours with the urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the fa@@ eces .
following intraven@@ ous dosage of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al clearance of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 71 ml / min and systemic clearance did not over@@ ride 200 ml / min .
in rats , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is not ex@@ cre@@ ted via the acid or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kidneys and therefore it is not assumed that the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other drugs is affected by these transport systems .

characteristics in patients Pre @-@ clinical studies have shown that the portion of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , which is not deposited in the bone , is quickly dischar@@ ged via the urine .
although there are no clinical data about it , it is nonetheless likely that the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at as in animal studies will also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function .
therefore , a slightly increased cum@@ ulation of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in bone is expected in patients with reduced kidney function ( see section 4.2 ) .

Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f is administered to adult patients with a kidney or liver transplan@@ ted to prevent rejection of transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system .
since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already used in the EU , the company has presented the results of previously carried out studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft and data from published literature .
in addition , the results of a clinical study were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ t , with the use of Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ t was rep@@ elled after a treatment duration of one year ( for example , by examining how often a new organ transplan@@ t or a res@@ ump@@ tion of di@@ aly@@ sis was required ) .
in addition , shorter further studies were conducted in 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ t and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ t and examined how Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f is absorbed by the body compared to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft .

in patients with hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any of the other components , Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f may not be applied .
patients and physicians must be careful if other ( especially some herbal ) drugs are taken simultaneously with Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f , as the Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f dose or the dose of the medication taken at the same time must be appropriately adapted accordingly .

only physicians who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
clin@@ ically relevant variations of the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of adverse events , including immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; reform@@ ulation of the formulation or the regime should only be performed under close @-@ mes@@ hed control of a physician experienced in transplantation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
as a result of a change to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adaptation must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains intact .
the dosage of Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f should be based primarily on clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood @-@ level measurement ( see below &quot; Recommen@@ dations
after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f , the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us levels should be controlled before the change@@ over and over two weeks after conversion .
on Day 4 , systemic exposure , measured as a level mirror , with both form@@ ulations was comparable to both kidney and liver transplan@@ ted patients .
careful and repeated controls of the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley mirror are recommended during the first two weeks of transplantation on Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f to ensure proper substance exposure in the immediate post @-@ transplan@@ t phase .
since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a low clearance substance , an adaptation of the Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f can take several days until the Ste@@ ady State is reached .
if the patient &apos;s condition is not permitted in the first postoperative period , the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment can be administered intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate for the preparation of an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca .
duration of application To supp@@ ress the transplan@@ t rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression must be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified .
dose recommendations - kidney transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral adju@@ v@@ ant therapy should begin at 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
further dosage adjustment can be required later because the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can change after the transplan@@ t in the course of stabili@@ zation of the patient .
dose recommendations - liver transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of transplan@@ t rejection Ac@@ tual Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f therapy should start with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
dosage recommendation - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f M@@ ust a transplan@@ t receiver of twice daily dosage of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules can be changed to a once daily intake of Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f , this conversion has to take place in ratio 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , relative to the entire daily dose .
ren@@ al and liver transplan@@ t After switching from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants to Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f once a day , the treatment with the oral Initi@@ al@@ dose recommended in K@@ id@@ ney and liver transplan@@ t should begin for the prevention of gra@@ ft rejection .
heart transplan@@ t in adult patients who are switched to Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f is an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day once daily in the morning .
other transplan@@ t recipients , although there is no clinical experience with Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f in lung , pancre@@ atic and color@@ ect@@ al graf@@ ted patients , was used in an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day , in a oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and for col@@ on recipients in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dose adjustment in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function For maintenance of blood serum levels in the targeted area , a reduction of the dose may be required in patients with severe liver dysfunction .
patients with reduced kidney function Sin@@ ce the ren@@ al function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , it can be assumed that a dosage adjustment is not necessary .
due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , however , a careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including regular determination of the serum cholesterol level , a calculation of the cre@@ atine in@@ and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended .
conversion from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f When switching from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy caution is advised ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations for the blood level in full blood The dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases using full blood Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us tal@@ k@@ back controls .
it is recommended to perform frequent checks of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us levels during the first two weeks after transplan@@ t followed by perio@@ dic controls during maintenance therapy .
blood @-@ level mirror from Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also be controlled after switch from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f , dosage adjustment , changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or while applying substances that could change the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood circulation ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f is a medicine with a low clearance , adjustments to the dose may take several days until the Ste@@ ady State has entered .
the data in clinical trials suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases when the blood level in the blood is not exceeding 20 n@@ g / ml .
in clinical practice the blood levels of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the first time after liver transplan@@ ts are usually in the range of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and with kidney and heart transplan@@ ted patients with 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml .
during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients , blood concentrations were generally used in the range of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml .
this has led to serious adverse events including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects which may occur as a result of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us sub@@ - or over @-@ exposure .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; reform@@ ulation of the formulation or the regime should only be performed under close @-@ mes@@ hed control of a physician experienced in transplantation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection which proved to be therapy resistant to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation of Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f .
clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation of Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f is not yet available for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart transplan@@ t recipients and gra@@ ft receivers in pedi@@ atric patients .
due to possible interactions leading to a reduction in the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , taking herbal supplements containing St. John &apos;s wort ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) or other herbal remedies during treatment with Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diarr@@ ho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ - concentrations in the blood is offered , since the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels can be subject to considerable variations in such conditions .
in rare cases , a corneal or sep@@ tum @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hi@@ e referred to as cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy was observed under Pro@@ gra@@ f , which can therefore also occur under Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver function disorders , infections , fluid over@@ load and e@@ dem@@ a .
as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of malign@@ ant skin l@@ esi@@ ons due to suitable clothes or use of a sun protective device with a high protection factor .
if patients who are taking Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , symptoms of PRE@@ S such as head@@ ache , altered states of consciousness , conv@@ ul@@ sions , and vision disturbances should show a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g .
since Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f contains hard capsules , ret@@ ar@@ ded , lac@@ tose , special caution is required in patients with rare her@@ edi@@ tary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption .
simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies , known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can affect Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us &apos;s metabolism and consequently increase or decrease the blood values of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
it is therefore recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels while adding substances that can alter the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose to maintain uniform concentrations ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strongly distinctive interaction became with an@@ tim@@ y@@ co@@ tics such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , it@@ ra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and V@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Macro@@ yel@@ id antibiotic ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies revealed that the increase in blood levels was mainly due to the increased oral bio@@ availability of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us due to the in@@ hibition of gastro@@ intestinal metabolism .
highly dos@@ ed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or decrease the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the blood .
the effect of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us on the metabolism of other Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us drugs is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ hibition ; therefore , the simultaneous application of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us with medicines that are metaboli@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 may affect their metabolism .
since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can reduce the Clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and therefore increase hormone exposure , decisions on contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures must be particularly cau@@ tious .
the results of animal studies have shown that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can potentially l@@ essen the clearance of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ on and increase their half @-@ life .
the results of a small number of tests on transplan@@ t patients do not indicate that in contrast to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
in uter@@ o exposure a monitoring of the new@@ born is recommended for possible adverse effects of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( especially regarding its effect on the kidneys ) .
there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ cal@@ emia of the new@@ born ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. :
the side effect profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants is often difficult to determine because of the underlying disease of the patient and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
below , the side effects are listed in descending order ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( frequency based on available data not estimated ) .

infections and par@@ asi@@ tic diseases How well @-@ known in other highly effective immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants is often increased in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , suscep@@ ti@@ bility to infections ( viral , bacterial , my@@ co@@ tic , prot@@ ozo@@ ic ) .
cases of BK @-@ Virus @-@ associated ne@@ ph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C virus @-@ associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ k@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy , including therapy with Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f .
ben@@ ign or malign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms including EB@@ V @-@ associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ors were reported in connection with the treatment with Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
due to its high molecular weight , low water sol@@ ubil@@ ity and high binding of ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma proteins , it can be assumed that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is not di@@ aly@@ able .
the action mechanism and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects on the molecular level are likely to medi@@ ate the effects of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us by binding to a cy@@ tos@@ olic protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for the enrich@@ ment of the connection in the cellular nucle@@ us .
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent in@@ hibition of signal trans@@ duction channels in the T cell and thus prevents the tran@@ scription of a certain series of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tic genes .
tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us supp@@ resses the activation of T @-@ cells and the proliferation of B cells dependent on T @-@ hel@@ per cells , further the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ k@@ ines ( like inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ @-@ interfer@@ on ) as well as expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 receptor .

lung transplantation In an interim analysis of a recent , multic@@ entre study with oral Pro@@ gra@@ f , more than 110 patients were reported , who received either Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in as part of a 1 : 1 random@@ ization .
chronic gra@@ ft rejection , the ob@@ liter@@ ation of the bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis , was less common in the first year after the transplan@@ t ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) .
the survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ - and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) .
in patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , it occurred in 21.@@ 7 % of the cases for the emergence of a bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis ob@@ liter@@ ans compared to 3@@ 8.0 % under C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) .
the number of cases in which of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be changed to tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 13 ) was significantly larger ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients switched from tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us to c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , An@@ n Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 5@@ 80 ) .
the number of cases in which there was no acute rejection of transplan@@ ts was higher after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) for patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) .
in one study the incidence of bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis ob@@ liter@@ ation was significantly lower in patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
a multic@@ entre study with oral Pro@@ gra@@ f was performed on 205 patients undergoing pancre@@ atic and ren@@ al transplantation following a random@@ ised tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initi@@ al@@ dose ( per protocol ) of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then reached after reaching the desired level level of 8 to 15 n@@ g / ml per 5 .
the published clinical results of a mono@@ centric study with oral Pro@@ gra@@ f as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after col@@ on transplan@@ ts showed an updated survival rate of 75 % after 1 year under Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years .
methods for early detection of Ep@@ stein @-@ Bar@@ r ( EB@@ V ) - and CM@@ V @-@ infections , bone mar@@ ital expansion , additional gift of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 antagon@@ ist D@@ ac@@ li@@ zumab , lower initial doses of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , which lead to bas@@ al mirrors between 10 and 15 n@@ g / ml and recently transplan@@ t ir@@ radiation ( Abu @-@ El@@ mag@@ d et al . , An@@ n Sur@@ g 2001 ; 2@@ 34 : 4@@ 04 ) .
factors such as a low hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rit value and low protein concentrations that lead to an increase in the dis@@ connected fraction of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , or a strengthening of metabolism induced by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , should be responsible for the higher clearance rates observed after transplan@@ t .
this causes the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us to be almost completely metaboli@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby the ex@@ cre@@ tion occurs mainly via the bile .
in case of stable patients diagnosed with Pro@@ gra@@ f ( twice daily ) on Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f ( once daily ) in relation to the total daily dose , the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) under Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f was approximately 10 % lower than under Pro@@ gra@@ f .
it is recommended to perform frequent checks of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us levels during the first two weeks after transplan@@ t followed by perio@@ dic controls during maintenance therapy .
21 To treat adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection which have proved to be a therapy resistant to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation of Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver function disorders , infections , fluid over@@ load and e@@ dem@@ a .
28 confirmed acute rejection was 3@@ 2.6 % in the first 24 weeks in the Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f group ( N = 2@@ 37 ) and in the Pro@@ gra@@ f group ( N = 2@@ 34 ) 29.@@ 3 % .
the efficacy and safety of Pro@@ gra@@ f , C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in and Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f was compared in combination with Basili@@ x@@ ima@@ b antibody induction , MM@@ F and cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , in 6@@ 38 de nov@@ o ren@@ al transplan@@ ts .

adv@@ ata is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( a con@@ genital blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorder caused by the lack of factor VI@@ II ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application depend on whether advoc@@ ates are used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding in surgical procedures .
patients with ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A suffer from a factor VI@@ II deficiency , which causes blood cl@@ ots such as bleeding in joints , muscles or inner organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but produced by a method called re@@ combin@@ ant DNA :
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) has been introduced , which enables them to form the human scent factor VI@@ II .
adv@@ ata is similar to another medicine approved in the European Union named Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but is made differently so that the medicine does not contain proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A , including a study with 53 children under six years , the use of the medicine was investigated for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures .
the main study evaluated the efficacy of supplements in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 510 new blood types with &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; good . &quot;
the most common side effects of adv@@ ata ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ ache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VI@@ II .
advoc@@ ate may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the human cl@@ ot@@ ting factor VI@@ II , mouse or ham@@ ster protein , or any of the other ingredients .
in March 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Ba@@ x@@ ter AG a permit for the placing of lawyers in the entire European Union .
dosage and duration of sub@@ stitution therapy depend on the sever@@ ity of the factor VI@@ II deficiency , the location and extent of the bleeding and the patient &apos;s clinical condition .
in the case of the following ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic events , the factor VI@@ II activity in the corresponding period is not reduced to the specified plas@@ m@@ ash ( in % of the standard or in I.@@ E. / dl ) .
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer until the pain and acute impair@@ ment are eliminated .
repeat the injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) until the risk for the patient is over .
during the treatment course , an appropriate determination of the factor VI@@ II plasma is recommended to control the dose and the frequency of inj@@ ections .
individual patients may differ in their response to factor VI@@ II , different in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half @-@ value times .
3 Pro@@ phyla@@ xis For long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VI@@ II per kg body weight within 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VI@@ II plasma activities are not reached or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose , a test must be carried out in order to verify an inhibit@@ or .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that the factor VI@@ II therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures have to be considered .
the speed of administration should be directed to the patient &apos;s condition whereby the maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VI@@ II is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of Factor VI@@ II @-@ directed Ig@@ G immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using modified Be@@ thes@@ da as@@ say .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the extent of exposure to factor VI@@ II , whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure days is greatest and depends on genetic and other factors .
in pre@@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 exc@@ uses and an@@ am@@ n@@ estic @-@ known inhibit@@ or development , after conversion from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VI@@ II product to another , the recur@@ r@@ ence of ( lowest ) inhibit@@ ors was observed .
due to the rare occurrence of hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A in women , there are no experiences regarding the application of factor VI@@ II during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
in the largest number of patients , A@@ DR@@ s were inhibit@@ ors against factor VI@@ II ( 5 patients ) , which showed a higher risk of the formation of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , sometimes ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rarely known ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated based on the sum of individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) . the unexpected drop in the blood co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II @-@ Spi@@ eg@@ els was performed post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 post @-@ operative day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE in@@ fusion .
the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the time and both the factor VI@@ II@@ - mirror in plasma and the Clear@@ ance rate showed sufficient values on the 15th day of the day .
in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ ATE to 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed severe to moderate h@@ emati@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) , only one patient after 26 exposure days with A@@ DV@@ ATE showed a low inhibit@@ or ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in modified Be@@ thes@@ da @-@ Appro@@ ach ) .
in addition , none of the 53 pa@@ edi@@ atric patients with an age of less than 6 years and diagnosed heavy to moderate ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) , after previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) , found a F@@ VI@@ II inhibit@@ or .
in previously untreated patients of an ongoing clinical trial , 5 of 25 ( 20 % ) with A@@ DV@@ FA were treated with inhibit@@ ors against factor VI@@ II .
the patient &apos;s immune response to traces of contaminated proteins was analysed by examining the antibody ti@@ ter against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
a patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant up@@ trend as well as an persistent peak of the antibody level against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell proteins , otherwise there were no signs or symptoms indic@@ ative of an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
in four patients , the presence of Ur@@ tik@@ aria , Pr@@ ur@@ itus , rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ op@@ hil@@ es gran@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ tes was reported in several repeated product ex@@ positions within the study .
7 As with other intraven@@ ous products , allergic reactions of the allergic type were reported in A@@ DV@@ ATE , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ to@@ i@@ der reactions ( frequency not known ) .
the activated factor VI@@ II acts as a factor factor for the activated Factor IX and acceler@@ ates the formation of activated factor X by factor X .
all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ DV@@ ATE were performed in pre @-@ treated patients with severe or moderate ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( base value of the factor VI@@ II @-@ activity ≤ 2 % ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters stem from a cross @-@ over study with A@@ DV@@ ATE in 100 previously treated patients or &gt; 10 years and are listed in Table 3 below .

special caution when using A@@ DV@@ ATE is required you should inform your doctor if you recently have been treated with Factor VI@@ II products , especially if you have developed inhibit@@ ors .
these symptoms can present early signs of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic shock , which can additionally include the following symptoms : extreme di@@ zz@@ iness , loss of consciousness and extreme breathing difficulties .
if you are taking other medicines , please inform your doctor if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is non @-@ prescription medicine .
your doctor will charge your dose A@@ DV@@ ATE ( in international units or I.@@ U. ) depending on your physical condition and body weight , and whether it is used to prevent or treat bleeding .
patients who develop factor VI@@ II inhibit@@ ors If the expected factor VI@@ II mirrors in your plasma are not reached with A@@ DV@@ ATE or bleeding can not be controlled , this could be due to factor VI@@ II@@ -

based on the data available from the initial approval , the CH@@ MP continues to evaluate the benefit @-@ risk weighing as a positive , but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore , the CH@@ MP has decided on the basis of the safety profile of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which makes a filing of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , decided that the authorisation holder should apply for another extension procedure in 5 years .
December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited was officially granted the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the company has received its application for the approval of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
usually , however , the chest , the brain , the bones or the soft tissues ( tissue that connects , surrounds and supports other structures in the body ) are affected .
this is a type of virus genetically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is an &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus , &quot; which has been modified in such a way that it cannot produce copies of itself and thus cannot trigger infections in humans .
Adv@@ ex@@ in would have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and thus enable the cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein again .
the p@@ 53 @-@ protein produced from the defective p@@ 53 gene in the human body normally contributes to the restoration of damaged DNA and killing cells , if the DNA cannot be restored .
in the case of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , in which the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share .
the company presented data from a study with a patient where Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Krebs stood in the area of the under@@ belly , the bones and the brain .
after the CH@@ MP had checked the company &apos;s answers to the questions he asked , there were still some questions un@@ answered .
based on the review of the submitted documents , the CH@@ MP will generate a list of questions sent to the company on day 120 .
according to the CH@@ MP , it was not sufficiently proven that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tum@@ ours brings benefits to patients .
the Committee also had concerns about the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug .
in addition , the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be established in a reliable way and that it is neither harmful to the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient .
the company did not inform the CH@@ MP if the withdrawal has consequences for patients currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; compas@@ sion@@ ate @-@ use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; altered active ingredients &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are composed so that one of the effective components is released immediately and the other is released slowly over a few hours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever , inflammation of the nas@@ al passages caused by allergy to p@@ ollen ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cous swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) .
for adults and adolescents aged 12 and over , the recommended dose of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice daily a tablet , which is to be taken with or without food entirely with a glass of water .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and be terminated once the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are cleared .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medicine can be reduced to the con@@ sti@@ pation of the nose .
the main effective measures were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the symptoms of hay fever , which were reported by the patients before the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed using a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
when considering all hay fever symptoms other than ob@@ struction of the nose , the patients who took Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze reported a decrease in symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % , compared with 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in patients who took pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone .
when only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was seen , the patients under aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed a relief of symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients who took loss of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n alone .
the most common side effects of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , mouth @-@ dr@@ y@@ ness , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ omot@@ or hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ pation , head@@ ache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ency ( sleep@@ iness ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or any of the other ingredients , against adren@@ ergi@@ c agents or lau@@ ra adi@@ n ( another medicine for the treatment of allergies ) .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should also not be used in patients suffering from a con@@ genital glaucoma ( elevated intra@@ ocular pressure ) , cardiac or vascular disease including hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ) or hyper@@ tension ( cereb@@ ral stroke ) or a risk of hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe for the transport of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze throughout the European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but it is swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without breaking it , breaking or ch@@ ewing ) .
due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy ( see Section 5.1 ) , Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used in children under 12 years of age .
the duration of the application is to be kept as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms finish .
it is recommended to limit the use time to 10 days , as long @-@ term use can decrease the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with time .
after the swelling of the mu@@ cous membranes in the upper respiratory tract , the treatment can be continued with either des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n as a mon@@ otherapy .
because Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono @-@ oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or or within 2 weeks after completion of such a therapy .
this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , per@@ go@@ ddess , erg@@ ot@@ amine , d@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other de@@ on@@ ges@@ tiv@@ a , which can be attributed to per@@ oral or nas@@ al as a wave of Rhin@@ ology ( phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ oline , Nap@@ haz@@ olin , etc . ) .
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy have not been tested for this patient population and the data is not sufficient to provide appropriate dosage recommendations .
the safety and efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver function disorders and the data were not sufficient to provide appropriate dosage recommendations .
patients must be informed that the treatment must be ab@@ used in case of hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , nausea or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as head@@ ache or ampli@@ fication of head@@ ache ) .
patients with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder neck , or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze must be dispos@@ ed of at least 48 hours prior to the performance of der@@ mat@@ ological tests as anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines otherwise can prevent or reduce positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions .
in the course of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were observed .
the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or test showed no significant differences between those treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and those treated with placebo , regardless of whether the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n alone or with alcohol was taken .
enzyme responsible for the loss of the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be excluded completely .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not in@@ hibit in vi@@ vo C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhibit@@ ory and is neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
the harm@@ lessness of the use of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not assured , experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies , however , do not increase the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of the normal population .
since reproductive studies on animals are not always transmitted to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tive properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used during pregnancy .
however , patients should be advised that in very rare cases it may lead to a di@@ zz@@ iness which may result in impaired mobility or ability to operate machinery .
symptoms may vary between CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , decreased mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ an@@ ose , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and CN@@ S stimulation ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with possible le@@ thal routines .
head@@ ache , anxiety , weakened Mik@@ tion , muscular weakness and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , breath in@@ suffici@@ ency , heart rhythm disorders , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , thirst , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , vision disturbances and hyper@@ tension or hyp@@ ot@@ onia .
a CN@@ S stimulation is particularly likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth @-@ dry , pup@@ il star@@ re and - di@@ lat@@ ation , skin redness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include both the in@@ hibition of release of inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 of human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es and the in@@ hibition of the expression of the adult P @-@ sel@@ ec@@ tin on endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg has no influence on standard measurements of the flight line including the ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in controlled clinical trials at the recommended dosage of 5 mg a day there was no increased incidence of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo .
the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in the recommended dosage can cause further symp@@ a@@ thetic effects , such as increasing blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestations of CN@@ S arous@@ al .
1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged between 12 and 78 years took part in seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s with 4@@ 14 patients receiving Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets .
in both studies hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets , determined by the overall score for the symptoms ( except nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a swelling ) , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine via the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or ethnic origin .
in the context of an individual dose study for pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has been det@@ ectable within 30 minutes of ad@@ minist@@ ering in the plasma .
after the oral application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in healthy volunteers for 14 days , the flow equivalent of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached on day 10 .
in the context of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multiple dose study carried out as a tablet in healthy adult volunteers , it was found that four volunteers were badly metaboli@@ sed .
a component interaction study shows that the exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine after the sole administration of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was bio@@ equivalent to the exposure after administration of an Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
based on conventional safety har@@ mac@@ ology studies , toxic@@ ity in repeated doses , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , however , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n cannot detect any particular dangers for humans .
the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual constitu@@ ents , and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine .
in reproductive toxic@@ ity studies the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n / P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ ic in the oral administration of rats at a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and in rab@@ bits at a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
March 2007 and in Module 1.@@ 8.1 of the authorisation application described pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance system is established and works before and while the product is on the market .
anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to allevi@@ ating the allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s own substance , its effect .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever ) , such as sne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ chy nose and watering or it@@ chy eyes with con@@ current con@@ sti@@ pation of the nose .

tell your doctor if you are experiencing or diagnosed with the following symptoms or diseases when using Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze : • hyper@@ tension • heart@@ beat , pal@@ pit@@ ations • heart rhythm disorders • nausea and head@@ ache or ampli@@ fication of existing head@@ aches .
take Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze with other medicines Please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription medicine .
transport and handling of machines When used in the recommended dosage , it is not to be expected that Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze leads to ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness or lowers the attention .
if you have taken a larger amount of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist immediately if you have taken a larger amount of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should .
if you forgot the dosage of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze if you forgot to take a dose in time , get the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the scheduled time .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the side effects listed will significantly affect you or notice any side effects that are not indicated in this information .
heart ch@@ asing , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , th@@ ing@@ iness , di@@ zz@@ iness , sore throat , loss of appetite , con@@ sti@@ pation , sugar in the urine , increased blood sugar levels , thirst , fatigue , head@@ ache , sleep disorders , nerv@@ ousness , and di@@ zz@@ iness .

after the market launch of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has been very rare reported on cases of severe allergic reactions ( breathing difficulties , whist@@ ling breathing , it@@ ching , n@@ ett@@ le rash and swelling ) or skin ras@@ hes .
cases of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart ch@@ ase , abdominal pain , nausea , vom@@ iting , stomach upset , diarr@@ ho@@ ea , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , nausea , sei@@ zur@@ es , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , cases of liver inflammation and cases of con@@ spic@@ uous liver values were also very rare .
it is available as 5 mg tablet , 5 m@@ g@@ - ly@@ op@@ hili@@ s@@ ate ( soluble tablet ) , 2.5 M@@ g@@ - and 5 mg melting tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and 0.5 mg / ml solution .
for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once a day , in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup or respectively .
for children aged six to eleven years , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or sy@@ rup .
A@@ eri@@ us was examined in a total of eight studies involving about 4,@@ 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four studies of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies to patients who also had asthma ) .
the effectiveness was measured by identifying changes in symptoms ( itch , number and size of p@@ add@@ les , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance during the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment .
further studies have been submitted to prove that the body utili@@ zes the sy@@ rup , the solution to inhal@@ e and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless .
in case of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , if the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us increased by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients receiving placebo .
in the two studies in Ur@@ tik@@ aria the decrease of the symptom sheet after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared with 40 and 33 % in the patients treated with placebo .
eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , lau@@ ra adi@@ n or any of the other ingredients .
in January 2001 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe for the placing of A@@ eri@@ us in the entire European Union .
one tablet once a day , with one or without a meal , for allevi@@ ating symptoms in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persist@@ ing allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adol@@ escence from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should be done according to the previous disease progression and may be terminated after the symptoms are cleared and res@@ um@@ ed upon res@@ um@@ ing .
the persist@@ ing allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) can be recommended to the patient during the allergy period a prolonged treatment .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions have not been determined in clinical studies with Dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were given in addition ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , the performance reduction effect of alcohol was not enhanced while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be advised that in very rare cases it may be assumed that there may be an interference with transport or ability to operate machinery .
in clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more side effects were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us daily than in patients treated with placebo .
the most commonly reported side effects reported more often than placebo were fatigue ( 1.2 % ) , mouth @-@ dry ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ ache ( 0.@@ 6 % ) .
in a clinical study involving 5@@ 78 juven@@ ile patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common side effects were head@@ aches , which occurred at 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with Dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and 6.@@ 9 % of patients who were treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multiple dose study , which was administered up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times clinical dose ) .
this includes inhibit@@ ing the release of inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 of human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the adult P @-@ sel@@ ec@@ tin on endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
as part of a clinical study involving multiple doses of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered at a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times of the clinical dose ) over ten days , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg has no influence on standard measurements of the flight line including the ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear fluid and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may also be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and persist@@ ing allergic rh@@ initi@@ s depending on the duration of the symptoms .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
as demonstrated by the total score of the questionnaire for quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the stress caused by the seasonal cause of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was investigated for further forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology , despite the ae@@ ti@@ ology , is similar to the different forms and can be easily pro@@ spec@@ tively recru@@ ited for chronic patients .
as hist@@ amine release is a caus@@ ative factor in all ur@@ tic@@ ari@@ al diseases , it is expected that Dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , apart from chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , also leads to an improvement in the symptoms in other forms of the ur@@ tic@@ aria ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving the number and number of p@@ add@@ ling at the end of the first dose interval .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria the minority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines were excluded from the study .
improved it@@ ching by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with Dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n compared to 19 % of patients receiving placebo .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us significantly reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and w@@ aking , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which patients were comparable to the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , 4 % of patients reached a higher concentration of Dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
there are no clu@@ es for clin@@ ically relevant accumulation after once daily application of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , the enzyme responsible for the di@@ aboli@@ sm of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines are not completely ruled out .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not in@@ hibit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 in vi@@ vo and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhibit@@ ory and is neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
in a single dose study with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n at a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , cal@@ orie rich breakfast ) did not affect the availability of the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
the prec@@ lin@@ ical studies carried out with Dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
based on conventional safety har@@ mac@@ ology studies , toxic@@ ity in repeated dose , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n cannot reveal any particular dangers to humans .

eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals , for allevi@@ ating symptoms in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persist@@ ing allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ bing physician should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s in children under 2 years of age are caused by infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that there are no data which support a treatment of infectious Rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
apart from the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatom@@ ic ab@@ norm@@ alities , an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and corresponding laboratory and skin tests should play a role in the diagnosis .
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years of age are restricted to metabolic des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and experience higher substance exposure ( see section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years , which has to be metaboli@@ zed , is identical to that of children who metaboli@@ se normally .
this medicine contains su@@ c@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ c@@ tose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ c@@ rose is@@ om@@ alt@@ astic in@@ suffici@@ ency of this medicine should not take this medicine .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions have not been determined in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were given in addition ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , the performance reduction effect of alcohol was not enhanced while taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup group as in the placebo group .
in clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in different indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the recommended dose of 3 % reported more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study for adults and adolescents with up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times clinical dose ) .
children between the ages of 1 and 11 who came into question for anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy received a daily des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in@@ dose of 1.@@ 25 mg ( between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n are similar in adults and children , the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population .
as part of a clinical study involving multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was applied in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the ne@@ o@@ fold of the clinical dose ) over ten days in adults , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval .
in controlled clinical studies , the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents showed no increased incidence of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo .
at a single dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical trials did not affect psych@@ omot@@ or activity .
in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , it was neither alcohol @-@ induced nor impaired to increase drow@@ sin@@ ess by taking alcohol at the same time .
in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear fluid and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as demonstrated by the total score of the questionnaire for quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets reduce the effectiveness caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving the number and number of p@@ add@@ ling at the end of the first dose interval .
the spread of this restricted metabolic phen@@ otype was comparable in adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations greater in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ ca@@ si@@ ans ( 2 % adult , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi@@ dose study with the sy@@ rup formation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , which may be restricted .
the strain ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ MA@@ X approximately 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ life of approximately 120 hours .
there are no clu@@ es for clin@@ ically relevant active substance accumulation after once daily application of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In various single dose studies , AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ MA@@ x values for pedi@@ atric patients were comparable with the recommended doses of pedi@@ atric patients with those of adults who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .
however , the enzyme responsible for the di@@ aboli@@ sm of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out .

immediately before application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the ly@@ op@@ hili@@ s@@ ate must be taken for taking , without damaging it .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally applied ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets were reported daily , than in patients treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multiple dose study , which had up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times clinical dose ) .
in two single dose studies , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ op@@ hili@@ sat was well tolerated ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data .
as part of a clinical study involving multiple doses of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the ne@@ o@@ fold of the clinical dose ) over ten days , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval .
in controlled clinical trials at the recommended dosage of 5 mg a day there was no increased incidence of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo .
for a 17 single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg has no influence on standard measurements of the flight line including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear fluid and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as demonstrated by the total score of the questionnaire for quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the stress caused by the seasonal cause of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
18 In a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which the patients were comparable to the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , 4 % of patients reached a higher concentration of Dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .

there is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adol@@ escence from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 )
immediately before the application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the melting tablet must be removed without damaging it .
the efficacy and safety of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg melting tablets in the treatment of children under 6 years have not been proven yet .
overall frequency of adverse events between the lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup and the placebo group was the same and did not differ significantly from the safety profile observed in adult patients .
at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us was used as a bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablet formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ op@@ hili@@ sat for the decreasing formulation of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
as part of a clinical study with multiple doses , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was applied in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically significant
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg has no influence on standard measurements of the flight line including the ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
the spread of this poorly metaboli@@ zed phen@@ otype was comparable to adult ( 6 % ) and pedi@@ atric patients between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) , and under black ( adults 18 % , children 16 % ) , the safety profile of these patients was however not different from that of the general population .
the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent in single dose @-@ crossover studies by A@@ eri@@ us Mel@@ ting tablets with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ op@@ hili@@ s@@ ate .
A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not studied in pedi@@ atric patients , in connection with the dose @-@ finding studies in children , however , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us melting tablets support the use of 2.5 mg dosage for children from 6 to 11 years .

the safety of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in children between 2 and 11 years , which is subject to restricted metabolic processes , is identical to that of children who metaboli@@ se normally .
this medicine contains sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ c@@ tose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ c@@ rose @-@ is@@ om@@ alt@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine .
the total frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the Dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n group as with the placebo group .
in infants , between 6 and 23 months , the most common side effects reported more often than with placebo , diarr@@ ho@@ ea ( 3.@@ 7 % ) , fever ( 2,3 % ) and in@@ som@@ nia ( 2,3 % ) .
in an additional study , a one @-@ time dose of 2.5 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n solution for taking up no side effects in patients aged between 6 and 11 years was observed .
at the recommended doses , the plasma concentrations of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( see section 5.2 ) were similar in the children &apos;s and adult population .
in controlled clinical studies , the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents showed no increased incidence of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s can also be found in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , depending on the duration of the symptoms .
as demonstrated by the total score of the questionnaire for quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets reduce the strain caused by seasonal , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
the spread of this restricted metabolic phen@@ otype was comparable in adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations greater in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ ca@@ si@@ ans ( 2 % adult , 3 % children ) .
since A@@ eri@@ us solution contains the same concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , no aqu@@ ac@@ qui@@ escence study was required and it is expected that it corresponds to the sy@@ rup and the tablets .
in various single dose studies , AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ MA@@ x values for pedi@@ atric patients were comparable with the recommended doses of pedi@@ atric patients with those of adults who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .

June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. officially announced the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) to prevent aqu@@ eous H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influ@@ enza in adults and elderly people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against flu caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influ@@ enza A virus .
this is a special kind of vaccine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
a pan@@ de@@ mic outbreak occurs when a new strain of the flu virus appears , which can easily spread from man to person , because humans have not built up immunity ( no protection ) against it .
when the vaccine is administered , the immune system detects the parts of the flu virus contained in the vaccine as &quot; foreign to the body &quot; and forms antibodies against it .
as a result , the immune system will later be able to produce antibodies quickly in contact with a flu virus .
subsequently , the membrane cover of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which the human body recognis@@ es as a body foreign ) has been removed , cleaned and used as part of the vaccine .
an inspection of some of the study centres showed that the study was not conducted according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
the scope of the clinical data base was not sufficient to assess the safety of the vaccine in order to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pre @-@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines .
if you are interested in participating in a clinical trial and require further information regarding your treatment , please contact your doctor .
if you would like more information regarding the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs for the treatment of adults and children over four years infected with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution for taking the capsules , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r as the safety of this combination was not investigated .
A@@ gener@@ ase should only be prescribed when the doctor has checked the anti@@ viral drug the patient has previously taken and the likel@@ ihood that the virus is addressed to the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years amounts to 600 mg twice daily , which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral medicines .
in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ gener@@ ase depends on the body weight .
in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , A@@ gener@@ ase decreases the HIV @-@ amount in the blood and keeps it at a low level .
aids do not cure , but may delay the damage to the immune system and thus the development of AIDS related infections and diseases .
A@@ gener@@ ase was investigated in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs , but without det@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults , previously not treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the dose intensified with low dose rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was compared with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in 20@@ 6 adults who used prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the change in the viral load after treatment .
in the studies with patients who previously had no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , after 48 weeks under A@@ gener@@ ase , more patients had a viral load of less than 400 copies / ml than placebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children A@@ gener@@ ase also reduced the viral load , but only very few of the children who had been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were only very few in the treatment .
in the adults study previously treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the treatment with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased the viral load after 16 @-@ weeks treatment just as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , A@@ gener@@ ase , together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , came to a stronger decrease in the viral load after four weeks compared to the patients who took up their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , diarr@@ ho@@ ea ( diarr@@ hea ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( flat@@ ul@@ ence ) , nausea , vom@@ iting , rash and fatigue .
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ bri@@ avi@@ r or any of the other ingredients .
A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients with St. John &apos;s Wort ( a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or medicines that are degra@@ ded just like ather@@ m@@ atism and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood .
as with other drugs against HIV , patients who are taking aspir@@ in are the risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , oste@@ o@@ deficiency ( death of bone tissue ) or immune re@@ activation syndrome ( symptoms of infection caused by the recovered immune system ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years out@@ weigh the risks .
A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee noted that the use of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who had not previously taken any prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors is not proven .
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally licensed under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o Group Limited to appro@@ ve the transport of A@@ gener@@ ase across the European Union .
A@@ gener@@ ase is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) pre@@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are to be given to pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ sters of am@@ bri@@ avi@@ r together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of Am@@ pren@@ o@@ r should be carried out taking into account the individual viral resistance pattern and pre @-@ treatment of the patient ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ bri@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % less than from am@@ bri@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for taking on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis are not ex@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules amounts to 600 mg of am@@ bri@@ avi@@ r twice a day along with 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are used without the ampli@@ fying supplement of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses of A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) need to be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules amounts to 20 mg of am@@ bri@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg of am@@ bri@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not examined in children .
A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age , due to lack of data on safety and efficacy ( see Section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules in adult patients should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function disorders to 300 mg twice daily .
simultaneous use should be taken with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction they are contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
A@@ gener@@ ase should not be used simultaneously with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and can also present substrates from the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ er 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations containing St. John &apos;s wort ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used because of the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of am@@ bri@@ avi@@ r during the intake of am@@ bri@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should be informed that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of the HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including the treatment with as@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are used together with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of serious liver side effects , potentially fatal .
for the case of an simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant specialist information of this medicine .
patients with previously reduced h@@ ep@@ atic functions , including chronic hepatitis , showed an increased frequency of h@@ ep@@ atic dys@@ functions under anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored in accordance with clinical practice .
simultaneous use of as@@ gener@@ ase and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ tic@@ as@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , which are metaboli@@ zed via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids including Cus@@ hing and Supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since the metabolism of the H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous administration of a@@ gener@@ ase with lov@@ ast@@ atin and sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis .
4 For some drugs that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) , methods are available for determining the drug concentration .
for patients taking this medicine at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase may be less effective because of the reduced plasma levels of Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with amp@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives can be altered , but the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is simultaneously given with amp@@ avi@@ rus at the same time , the patients should therefore be monitored for op@@ thal@@ ate symptoms , especially if even lower doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered .
due to the possible risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high propylene gly@@ col content of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under 4 years of age and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be set for 5 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were reported on the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia or an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other diseases to which drugs were required to be associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
B. higher age , and associated with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
hem@@ op@@ hili@@ c patients ( Type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors are reports of an increase in bleeding , including spontaneous cell ha@@ emat@@ oma and hem@@ or@@ rho@@ sis .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) may develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections leading to severe clinical conditions or wor@@ sen@@ ing of symptoms .
although a multi@@ fac@@ torial e@@ ology is adopted ( including the use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , heavy immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ) , cases of oste@@ o@@ deficiency are particularly reported in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long @-@ term treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 substrates with a low therapeutic width of A@@ gener@@ ase should not be used simultaneously with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and can also present substrates from the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ er 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrates with a low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be used together with medicines whose active ingredients are metaboli@@ zed via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are linked to higher plasma levels with serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ bri@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
in the attempt to balance the reduced plasma levels by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , adverse effects were observed in the liver .
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of am@@ pren@@ o@@ r can be reduced by the simultaneous application of plant preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient already takes St. John &apos;s wort , the amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r@@ ye mirror and , if possible , check the viral load and susp@@ end the St. John &apos;s wort .
a dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not necessary if Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is given together with Am@@ pren@@ o@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
5@@ 08 % increases , compared to C@@ MA@@ X by 30 % , when rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) is administered in combination with am@@ bri@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical trials , doses of 600 mg of am@@ bri@@ avi@@ r were applied twice daily and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , demonstrating the efficacy and safety of this treatment regi@@ men .
hum@@ bu@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with Kal@@ eter@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) was administered .
the C@@ min values of amp@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ pren@@ o@@ r ( 600 mg twice a day ) is administered twice a day in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day .
dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ o@@ r and cal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , close @-@ mes@@ hed surveillance is recommended , as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study was carried out in combination with di@@ an@@ os@@ ine in combination with di@@ an@@ os@@ ine , but due to the in@@ ventive component of di@@ an@@ os@@ ine it is recommended that the revenues of di@@ an@@ os@@ ine and as@@ gener@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) .
for this reason , in combination with am@@ bri@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , dosage adjustment is not necessary .
the treatment with enam@@ el cavi@@ ar in combination with am@@ pren@@ o@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be low .
the effects of ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and available limited data suggest that ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ ine may reduce the serum concentration of amp@@ avi@@ r .
if these drugs should be used at the same time , caution is advised , since Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din may be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma levels .
if these drugs are used together , caution is required ; thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be undertaken as a precise predic@@ tion of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ o@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
the simultaneous administration of am@@ eth@@ avi@@ r and ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in the plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) of Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % , resulting in an increase in side effects associated with Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase , the dose of Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin will be reduced to at least half of the recommended dose , although there are no clinical data .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin have not been performed , however the plasma levels of both pharmaceuticals could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration .
simultaneous application of twice a day 700 mg of f@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol once daily led to an increase in the C@@ MA@@ X of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) once daily without simultaneous application of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ o@@ ar with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines listed below , including substrates , inhibit@@ ors , or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can possibly lead to interactions .
patients should therefore be monitored on toxic reactions associated with these drugs if they are used in combination with as@@ gener@@ ase .
based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it is advisable that ant@@ acids are not taken at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase because it can result in erectile dysfunction .
simultaneous use of anti@@ conv@@ ul@@ ants known as enzyme reduc@@ ers ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with Am@@ pren@@ o@@ r , can result in a degradation of the plasma levels of Am@@ pren@@ o@@ r .
serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , ri@@ o@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ po@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ po@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ po@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ po@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@
simultaneous ing@@ es@@ tion with aspir@@ in can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and strengthen with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors associated with side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study where Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given 100 mg capsules twice a day along with 50 µ@@ g of flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) , the fluor@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate plasma levels increased significantly while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r together with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids is not recommended , unless the potential benefits of treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( see paragraph 4.4 ) .
H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are marked increases in plas@@ m@@ asp@@ ing while ad@@ minist@@ ering A@@ gener@@ ase .
because plasma levels of these H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy including a r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined application of these drugs is not recommended with amp@@ avi@@ ar .
more frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations to the stabili@@ zation of the mirrors is recommended as the plasma concentrations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased with the simultaneous administration of am@@ bri@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) .
therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase should not be used together with Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) , while with simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am caution is advisable .
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in the plasma levels of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around 3 to 4 times .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with amp@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ pi@@ ate withdrawal symptoms , especially if even lower doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered .
because of the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , no recommendation can currently be given , such as the am@@ bri@@ avi@@ rus dose can be adjusted if Am@@ pren@@ o@@ r is given at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one .
in the case of simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of de@@ bil@@ itating or rein@@ forcing the anti@@ thro@@ mbo@@ tic effect ( see paragraph 4.4 ) .
the effect of suppl@@ em@@ enting Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , therefore alternative contrac@@ eption methods are recommended .
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( e.g. Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended with the simultaneous administration of aspir@@ in ( see paragraph 4.4 ) .
during pregnancy , this medicine may be used only after careful weighing of the possible benefit for the mother in comparison with the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
in the milk of lac@@ ing rats , amp@@ avi@@ r related substances were detected , but it is not known whether or not amp@@ avi@@ r is transferred to the mother &apos;s milk .
a reproduction study on pregnant rats , which was given by the incorpor@@ ation into the uter@@ us until the end of the breast@@ feeding period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase of 12 body weight in seed .
the further development of offspring including fertility and reproductive capacity was not affected by the administration of Am@@ pren@@ o@@ r to the dam .
A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s harm@@ lessness has been studied in adults and children over 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
most of the side effects associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment were mild to moderate , rose early and rarely led to the termination of the treatment .
in many of these events , it is not clari@@ fied whether they are connected to the use of aspir@@ in or another medicine used simultaneously for the treatment of HIV , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease .
most of the side effects mentioned below are from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 3@@ 001 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors received 1200 mg of as@@ gener@@ ase twice a day .
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) assessed by the investig@@ ators as in connection with study medication and performed in more than 1 % of patients as well as laboratory changes occurring in the treatment ( Grade 3 to 4 ) are listed .
anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of the body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including a loss of peripheral and differential vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissues , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ @-@ cervi@@ cal fat accumulation .
among 113 previously untreated patients treated with am@@ bri@@ avi@@ r in combination with lam@@ i@@ v@@ ud@@ ine / zi@@ do@@ v@@ ud@@ ine for a mean time of 36 weeks , only one case ( Sti@@ ern@@ acken ) ( &lt; 1 % ) was observed .
in the study PRO@@ J@@ 300@@ 6 in 2@@ 45 N@@ R@@ TI@@ - pre @-@ treated patients under Am@@ pren@@ o@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients under in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with various N@@ R@@ TI@@ s for an average duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
ras@@ hes were usually light up to moder@@ ately pronounced , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ous or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ pap@@ ul@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and occurred usually during the second treatment week and van@@ ished spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with amp@@ avi@@ rus had to be canc@@ eled .
oste@@ o@@ deficiency cases were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV infection or long @-@ term treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) may develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections ( see paragraph 4.4 ) .
in with PI pre @-@ treated patients receiving 600 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase two times a day along with low dose rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Grade 3 and 4 ) were comparable to those observed under certain ag@@ ro@@ ase treatment ; an exception formed increases in the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride and CP@@ K values obtained in patients who received A@@ gener@@ ase along with low dose rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very often .
in case of over@@ dose , the patient is aware of signs of in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , necessary suppor@@ tive measures .
Am@@ pren@@ o@@ r bin@@ ds to the active center of the HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and thus prevents the processing of viral ga@@ stri@@ c and g@@ ag @-@ polar poly@@ prot@@ ein@@ levels as a result of the formation of un@@ ripe , non infectious viral particles .
the anti@@ viral activity of amp@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was investigated on acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ o@@ r lies in the range of 0,@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in ac@@ utely infected cells and amounts to 0,@@ 41 µ@@ M in chronic infected cells
the connection between the activity of amp@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients with the currently approved type of f@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and det@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as with other rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described are rarely observed .
in sixteen out of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ pre @-@ treated patients receiving 700@@ mg of fossi@@ ls with 100@@ mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 trial , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred up to week 48 , whereby 14 isol@@ ates could be gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined .
gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isol@@ ate of 13 out of 14 children , in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within 59 , with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors not previously treated patients showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults .
L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , K@@ 20@@ R , V@@ 32@@ I , M@@ 46@@ I / M / T / V , I@@ 54@@ L / M / T / V , I@@ 54@@ L / M / T / V , I@@ 85@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , L@@ 90@@ M and I@@ 9@@ 3@@ L / M .
in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ o@@ r / 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) , patients with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred over 96 weeks for the following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or mut@@ ations :
gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing based analyses of gen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems can be used to estimate the activity of am@@ bri@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ o@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ e@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations L@@ 10@@ F / I , L@@ 33@@ F , M@@ 36@@ I , I@@ 54@@ A / L / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M /
the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns may be subject to changes through additional data , and it is recommended to always attract the current interpretation systems for analysis of the results of resistance tests .
phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing can be used in combination with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to estimate the activity of am@@ bri@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ o@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
companies that distribute diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinical @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs ( separation points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be used to interpret the results of resistance testing .
each genetic pattern that is associated with a reduced sensitivity to Am@@ pren@@ o@@ r generates a certain cross @-@ resistance against Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to ind@@ in@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r stays in general maintained .
there are currently data on cross @-@ resistance between amp@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 types of f@@ ossa , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
based on twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ pre @-@ treated patients ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , Dar@@ in@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 25 isol@@ ates ) , Dar@@ in@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 isol@@ ates ) , sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 isol@@ ates ) , and Ti@@ den@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
on the other hand , Am@@ pren@@ o@@ r retains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; maintaining this activity appears to depend on the number and type of resistance @-@ mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
the early departure of a se@@ eding therapy is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations that can adver@@ sely affect the subsequent treatment .
the evidence of the efficacy of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Nu@@ cle@@ av@@ dan@@ iel@@ a ( 100 mg twice daily ) and Nu@@ cle@@ osi@@ dan@@ iel@@ a ( N@@ R@@ TI ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with PI , mainly used with low @-@ dose rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
one hundred and sixty ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 partial study .
the primary analysis determined the non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in the viral load ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the viral load ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in plasma after 16 weeks , in a non @-@ under@@ laying threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
evidence of the effectiveness of un@@ blocked ap@@ eri@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials of 28@@ 8 HIV infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were pre @-@ treated with PI .
in the studies , A@@ gener@@ ase was tested twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice daily .
no low dos@@ ed p@@ inion was given at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of the patients included in the study had a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml with medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to bas@@ eline .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 19 Based on this data , the benefits of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ ble@@ ached &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should be considered in therapy optimisation for children treated with PI . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after oral dosing , the average duration ( T@@ max. ) is about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
5@@ 08 % , by contrast , reduced by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ X , when rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with amp@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of Am@@ pren@@ o@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in the AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ bri@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosing ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimum concentration in the ste@@ ady state ( C@@ min , ss ) remained unaffected by the intake of food , although the simultaneous food intake was influenced by the extent and rate of absorption .
the apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be concluded on a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ imped@@ ed penetration of am@@ bri@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma , whereby the amount of invol@@ un@@ tary am@@ bri@@ avi@@ r , which represents the active portion , probably remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of an un@@ connected amp remains constant , the percentage of free active constitu@@ ent fluctu@@ ates during the dosing interval in dependence on the total drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State over the range of C@@ MA@@ X , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce or in@@ hibit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ s or present a substrate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 have to be administered cau@@ ti@@ ously if they are given at the same time with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice daily or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily Am@@ pren@@ o@@ r exposure like in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily .
Am@@ pren@@ o@@ r is a solution of 14 % less bio@@ availability than the capsules ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase solution and A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not ex@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram@@ m@@ basis .
also the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is negli@@ gible , therefore the effect of a ren@@ al dys@@ functions on the elimination of Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r should be minimal .
these regi@@ mens of treatment lead to am@@ bri@@ avi@@ r plas@@ mas@@ ons comparable to those obtained from healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ or@@ r twice a day without simultaneous ad@@ minist@@ ering of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies of carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ bri@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ at@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas en@@ ig@@ ne@@ ous h@@ ep@@ at@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas during dos@@ ages corresponding to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8 @-@ fold ( rat ) exposure to humans , after twice daily dose of 1200 mg of am@@ par@@ ra@@ r .
the underlying mechanism for the development of h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
however , there was little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings from the actual exposure data on humans , both from clinical trials and therapy applications .
in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro toxic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es @-@ Test ) , mouse @-@ lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test on rats and chromos@@ ome ab@@ err@@ ations in human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , was neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and verified in clinical practice by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
until now , no significant liver toxic@@ ity has been observed in clinical trials , neither during the administration of aspir@@ in nor after the end of the treatment .
studies on the toxic@@ ity of young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mort@@ ality in both the control and the animals treated with amp@@ avi@@ rus .
in systemic plasma @-@ exposure , which was significantly below ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than expected exposure in humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ me disease and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed , which indicate delayed development .
24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are used without the ampli@@ fying supplement of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses of A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) need to be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules amounts to 20 mg of am@@ bri@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg of am@@ bri@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
simultaneous use should be taken with caution in patients with minor or minor liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction they are contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
26 For some drugs that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) , methods are available for determining the drug concentration .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be set to 27 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer @-@ lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ bri@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
5@@ 08 % increases , compared to C@@ MA@@ X by 30 % , when rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) is administered in combination with am@@ bri@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of amp@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ pren@@ o@@ r ( 600 mg twice a day ) is administered twice a day in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day .
dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ o@@ r and cal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , close @-@ mes@@ hed surveillance is recommended , as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
the treatment with enam@@ el cavi@@ ar in combination with am@@ pren@@ o@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be low .
if these drugs are used together , caution is required ; thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be undertaken as a precise predic@@ tion of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ o@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dose of Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin will be reduced to at least half of the recommended dose 31 although there are no clinical data .
serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , ri@@ odi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ po@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ po@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ po@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ po@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ po@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ po@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine
in a clinical study where Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given 100 mg capsules twice a day along with 50 µ@@ g of flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) , the fluor@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate plasma levels increased significantly while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
in the case of simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of de@@ bil@@ itating or rein@@ forcing the anti@@ thro@@ mbo@@ tic effect ( see paragraph 4.4 ) .
simultaneous administration of Orth@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg E@@ thin@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1,0 mg Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dron ) led to a decrease in the AU@@ C and C@@ min of Am@@ pren@@ o@@ R by 22 % or respectively .
during pregnancy , this medicine may be used only after careful consideration of the potential benefits for the mother in comparison with the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
a reproduction @-@ study on pregnant rats , which was given by the incorpor@@ ation into the uter@@ us until the end of the breast@@ feeding period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during pregnancy .
A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s harm@@ lessness has been studied in adults and children over 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
in case of over@@ dose , the patient is aware of signs of in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , necessary suppor@@ tive measures .
the anti@@ viral activity of amp@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was investigated on acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ o@@ r is in the range of 0,@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in ac@@ utely infected cells and amounts to 0,@@ 41 µ@@ M in chronic infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
on the other hand , Am@@ pren@@ o@@ r retains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; maintaining this activity appears to depend on the number and type of resistance @-@ mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; based on these data , the benefits of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ ble@@ ached &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as@@ gener@@ ase should be considered in therapy optimisation for children treated with PI . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the absolute concentration of an un@@ connected amp remains constant , the percentage of free active constitu@@ ent fluctu@@ ates during dosing interval in dependence on the total drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State over the area of C@@ MA@@ X , ss to C@@ min , ss ..
therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce or in@@ hibit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ s or present a substrate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 have to be administered cau@@ ti@@ ously if they are given at the same time with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
also the ren@@ al clearance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is negli@@ gible ; therefore , the effect of a ren@@ al dysfunction should be minimal due to the elimination of am@@ bri@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity of mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ at@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas en@@ ig@@ ne@@ ous h@@ ep@@ at@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas during dos@@ ages corresponding to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8 @-@ fold ( rat ) exposure to humans after twice daily dose of 1200 mg of am@@ eth@@ avi@@ r .
the underlying mechanism for the formation of h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ el@@ ular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .

studies on the toxic@@ ity of young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mort@@ ality in both the control and the animals treated with amp@@ avi@@ rus .
these results suggest that in young people the metabolism methods are not yet fully developed , so that amp@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) are found .
aspir@@ ation for inhal@@ ation is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) pre@@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the use of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gh@@ ost@@ ra@@ r &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been proven neither with PI pre@@ treated patients nor with PI pre@@ treated patients . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bio@@ availability of am@@ bri@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % less than from am@@ bri@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for taking on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis are not ex@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
patients should stop taking the capsules once they are able to swal@@ low the capsules ( see paragraph 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 28@@ 00 mg of am@@ bri@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in addition , as no dosage recommendation for the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase solution for inser@@ ting and low dose rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r can be given , this combination can be avoided in these patient groups .
although a can adjustment for am@@ bri@@ avi@@ r is not considered necessary , an application of A@@ gener@@ ase solution for inclusion in patients with ren@@ al failure is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of the high propylene gly@@ col content , A@@ gener@@ ase is contra@@ indicated for taking in infants and children under 4 years , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure .
simultaneous administration can lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of the metabolism of these drugs and possibly cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as heart rhythm disorders ( z ) .
patients should be informed that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of the HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including the treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of 47 transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) , methods are available for determining the drug concentration .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be removed permanently if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
increased risk for a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug @-@ 49 dependent factors , such as a longer @-@ lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
hem@@ op@@ hili@@ c patients ( Type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors are reports of an increase in bleeding , including spontaneous cell ha@@ emat@@ oma and hem@@ or@@ rho@@ sis .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ bri@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
5@@ 08 % increases , compared to C@@ MA@@ X by 30 % , when rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) is administered in combination with am@@ bri@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
simultaneous ing@@ es@@ tion with aspir@@ in can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and increase with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors associated with side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) .
based on the data to 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ s inhibit@@ ors , Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am anticip@@ ates significantly higher plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
the potential risk for humans is not known . due to possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us the contained Prop@@ ylene gly@@ col may not be used during pregnancy ( see Section 4.3 ) .
in the milk of lac@@ ing rats , amp@@ avi@@ r related substances were detected , but it is not known whether or not amp@@ avi@@ r is transferred to the mother &apos;s milk .
a reproduction study on pregnant rats , which was given by the incorpor@@ ation into the uter@@ us until the end of the breast@@ feeding period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in 55 body weight during pregnancy .
A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s harm@@ lessness has been studied in adults and children over 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
in many of these events , it is not clari@@ fied whether they are connected to the use of aspir@@ in or another medicine used simultaneously for the treatment of HIV , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients with the currently approved type of f@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and det@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as with other rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described are rarely observed .
the early departure of a se@@ eding 60 therapy is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations that can adver@@ sely affect the subsequent treatment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 62 Based on this data , the benefits of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ ble@@ ached &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should be considered in therapy optimisation for children treated with PI . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be close to a large ve@@ to volume as well as an un@@ imped@@ ed penetration of am@@ bri@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .

if you have any further questions , please contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . - This medicine has been prescribed for you personally .
it can harm other people even if they have the same complaints as you . − If any of the side effects listed you are significantly impaired or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
your doctor will usually instruc@@ t you to apply A@@ gener@@ ase capsules along with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to enhance the effect of as@@ gener@@ ase .
the use of aspir@@ in is based on the individual viral resistance test carried out by your doctor and your treatment history .
tell your doctor if you are suffering from any of the above @-@ mentioned diseases or taking any of the drugs mentioned above .
if your doctor has recommended that you take A@@ gener@@ ase capsules along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r for strengthening the effect ( boo@@ ster ) , make sure you have carefully read the usage information on rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r before starting the treatment .
there is also no sufficient information to recommend the use of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r for ampli@@ fication in children between 4 and 12 years or generally in patients under 50 kg of body weight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , it is important that you read the section &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; When taking A@@ gener@@ ase with other medicines &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before you start taking A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot; &quot; &quot;
- In patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy , a re@@ distribution , accumulation or loss of body fat may occur .

it is recommended that HIV @-@ positive women should not breast@@ feed their children under any circumstances in order to avoid transmission of HIV .
transport efficiency and the operating of machines No studies have been carried out on the effect of ag@@ ase on driving ability or the ability to operate machinery .
please take this medicine only after consultation with your doctor if you are aware that you are suffering from certain sugar@@ s .
if you are taking Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , it is advisable that you take this more than one hour before or after A@@ gener@@ ase , otherwise the effects of A@@ gener@@ ase may be less@@ ened .
dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules amounts to 600 mg twice daily together with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
if your doctor decides that the intake of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not suitable for you , you will need to take higher doses ( 1200 mg of am@@ bri@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
if A@@ gener@@ ase benefits as much as possible , it is very important that you take the entire daily dose that your doctor has prescribed .

the application frequency and duration of treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the disease to be treated : • In case of small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , the cream is to be applied five times a week for six weeks . • In case of small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , it is possible to apply three times a week during one or two four @-@ week treatment cycles , with four weeks pause between the treatment cycles .
before bed@@ time , apply the cream to the affected areas of the skin so that they remain on the skin for a long time ( about eight hours ) before they are washed off .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared to a placebo ( the same cream but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies on 9@@ 23 patients with genital war@@ ts for 16 weeks each .
• Al@@ dar@@ a was also studied in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two studies in which patients were treated for six weeks and Al@@ dar@@ a or the placebo used either daily or five times a week .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the tum@@ ours after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies to a total of 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ oses .
• In all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than the placebo . • In the treatment of war@@ ts in the genital area , the total healing rate in all four main studies was 15 % to 52 % in patients treated with placebo . • The results of the two studies on bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas showed a total healing rate of 66 % to 80 % in the patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application area of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .

the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream has to be continued until all visible genital war@@ ts have disappeared in the genital or peri@@ anal area , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
inter@@ ruption in the treatment process described above should be considered if intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see Section 4.4 ) or if an infection is observed in the treatment area .
if follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period , the treated l@@ esi@@ ons are only incomplete , a different therapy should be started ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if a dose is om@@ itted , the patient should apply the cream as soon as he / she notices this and then proceed with the usual therapeutic plan .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is applied in a thin layer and must be rub@@ bed in the clean@@ sed skin area with f@@ eig@@ ni@@ ces until the cream is completely wrapped .
there should be a balance between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible wor@@ sen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease .
there should be a balance between the benefits of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft versus host reaction .
in other studies , in which no daily pre@@ h@@ emo@@ y@@ gi@@ ene was performed , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis were observed and a case with a disease leading to circumc@@ ision .
the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than recommended doses has increased risk of severe local irrit@@ ation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases severe local skin irrit@@ ation has been observed , which necess@@ itated a treatment and / or resulted in a temporary physical impair@@ ment .
in cases where such reactions occurred at the outlet of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine , which necess@@ itated emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area .
the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream immediately after treatment with other cut@@ aneous applied methods for the treatment of external genital war@@ ts in the genital and peri@@ anal area has not yet been clinical experience .
although limited data indicates an increased rate of secre@@ tion reductions in HIV positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream has shown lower effectiveness in this patient group with regard to the removal of the genital war@@ ts .
treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , nose , lips or hair@@ line was not examined .
local skin reactions are frequent , but the intensity of these reactions decreases in general during therapy or the reactions form after completion of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if it is necessary due to patient complaints or due to the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment period may be done several days .
the clinical outcome of the therapy may be assessed after regeneration of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
as there are currently no data on long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after treatment , other suitable forms of therapy should be taken into consideration in case of super@@ potent bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas .
in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs there is no clinical experience , therefore the use of pre @-@ treated tum@@ ours is not recommended .
data from an open clinical study suggest that large tum@@ ours ( &gt; 7,@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) are less likely to respond to I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not studied for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or ears or on the lip area within the cri@@ b .
only very limited data on the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ oses in anatom@@ ical places outside the face and scal@@ p are available .
the available data on the ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ ose on the for@@ ear@@ ms and hands do not support the effectiveness in this application , therefore such an application is not recommended .
local skin reactions often occur , but these reactions usually decrease in intensity over the course of therapy or go back after the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if local skin reactions cause great discomfort to the patient or are very strong , treatment may be suspended for a few days .
data from an open clinical study showed that patients with more than 8 l@@ esi@@ ons showed a lower total healing rate than patients with less than 8 l@@ esi@@ ons .
due to immun@@ o @-@ stimulating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be used with caution in patients receiving immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .
animal studies do not result in direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , de@@ binding or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) .
although quanti@@ fiable serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ n@@ g / ml ) were achieved neither after one @-@ time nor after repeated topical application , no recommendation can be given for the application during breast@@ feeding .
the most commonly shared and possibly or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in the studies with three @-@ week treatment were local reactions in the location of treatment of genital war@@ ts ( 3@@ 3.@@ 7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated patients ) .
among the most commonly reported and considered prob@@ able or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in the related side effects include discomfort on the application site with an incidence of 28.@@ 1 % .
side @-@ effects reported by 185 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream from a placebo @-@ controlled phase III clinical trial are shown below .
the most common adverse event , probably or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream , was a reaction to the application location ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated patients ) .
the side effects specified in 25@@ 2 in placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials of phase III with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream treated patients with ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ ose are listed below .
the evaluation of the clinical signs indicated by the test plan shows that in these placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with three @-@ week treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream frequently lead to local skin reactions including ery@@ thema ( 61 % ) , erosion ( 30 % ) , ex@@ cre@@ ori@@ ation / descent ( 23 % ) and o@@ e@@ dem@@ a ( 14 % ) ( see paragraph 4.4 ) .
the evaluation of the clinical signs indicated by the test plan shows that in these studies , five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream was very common to severe ery@@ thema ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and too severe scar@@ ring and c@@ em@@ ination ( 19 % ) .
in clinical trials for the treatment of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of the ac@@ tin ker@@ ato@@ sis , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was diagnosed with an incidence of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area .
the in@@ ad@@ vert@@ ent oral intake of 200 mg of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the content of approximately 16 bags , could result in nausea , vom@@ iting , head@@ ache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
the clin@@ ically serious side @-@ effect which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg consisted in hyp@@ ot@@ onia , which norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous fluids .
systemic concentrations of alpha @-@ interfer@@ ons and other cy@@ tok@@ ines have been detected in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic investigations according to the topical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od .
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al phase 3 efficacy studies could be demonstrated that the efficacy of a complete healing of the genital war@@ ts in I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment over 16 weeks of placebo treatment is significantly superior .
60 % of the patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated the genital war@@ ts completely ; this was the case with 20 % of the patients who were treated with placebo ( 95 % CI ) :
complete healing was achieved at 23 % of 157 treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated male patients , compared to 5 % of 161 treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) :
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od &apos;s effectiveness in five times per week over 6 weeks was investigated in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed individual primary artificial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
the data presented in an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years show that approximately 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.@@ 7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients were clin@@ ically cured and this remained for 48 months .
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od three times weekly application in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free period , was examined in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non @-@ hyper@@ ker@@ ato@@ id , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic ac@@ - l@@ esi@@ ons within a related 25 c@@ m2 treatment area on the un@@ ha@@ iry scal@@ p or face .
the one @-@ year data from two combined observation studies indicate a recur@@ r@@ ence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical radiation after one or two treatment periods .
the approved indications of external genital war@@ ts , ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ ose and super@@ fici@@ ent bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma usually do not occur in pedi@@ atric patients and have therefore not been studied .
Al@@ dar@@ a Cream was studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled trials involving children aged 2 to 15 with M@@ oll@@ us@@ c@@ um con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 3@@ 13 ) .
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies in the doses investigated there ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or respectively .
minimal systemic inclusion of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream through the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ ose was observed during the three @-@ week application during 16 weeks .
the highest drug concentrations in the serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 n@@ g / ml in the face ( 12.@@ 5 mg , 1 dispos@@ able bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 p@@ ou@@ ches ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 p@@ ou@@ ches ) .
the estimated obvious half @-@ life was about 10 times higher than the 2 hour half @-@ life after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in an earlier study ; this indicates an extended retention of the medicine in the skin .
data on systemic exposure showed that the res@@ or@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od after topical application on MC @-@ infected skin of patients aged 6 to 12 was low and comparable to that in healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ ose or super@@ bly bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
in a four month study on der@@ mal toxic@@ ity in rats doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg kg resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased sp@@ le@@ en weight ; a study of the der@@ mal application carried out four months also yiel@@ ded no similar effects for the mouse .
a two @-@ year study on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice on three days a week induced no tum@@ ours at the scope of application .
the appropriate mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od possesses only a low systemic ad@@ sorption of the human skin and is not mut@@ agen , it is a risk for humans to look very low due to systemic exposure .

patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions that are defined as any side effect occurring during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored , and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical setting in which re@@ vit@@ alization systems for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are immediately available .
due to the clinical phase 3 study , nearly all patients with Ig@@ G antibodies form against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the beginning of the treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
since there is little experience regarding the res@@ ump@@ tion of treatment after a longer break , due to the theore@@ tically increased risk of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions after an inter@@ ruption of treatment , it is necessary to proceed cau@@ ti@@ ously .
pre @-@ treatment 60 minutes before beginning of in@@ fusion with medication ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and / or anti @-@ py@@ re@@ agents ) in order to minimize the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
in case of a slight or medium @-@ severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ amo@@ l / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be considered and / or reduction of in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
in case of a single , severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are slow@@ ed down , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ amo@@ l / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is considered .
in@@ fusion can be re @-@ recorded by reducing the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ amo@@ l / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) and reduction of in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the previous reaction has occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or proc@@ aine , because there is a potential risk of interfer@@ ing with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular absorption of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
animal experimental studies do not indicate direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
since there are no data on new@@ bor@@ ns exposed to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase over breast milk , it is recommended not to breast@@ feed during treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
adverse events in clinical trials were mainly classified as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions , which were observed in 53 % of patients in phase 3 ( up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( duration of treatment up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me observed during the phase 3 study and its extension in a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older at a treatment duration of up to 4 years are presented in the following table according to the following frequencies : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre @-@ history severe reactions arose , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respiratory reli@@ ance and facial oil ( see Section 4.4 ) .
children Un@@ desirable drug interactions associated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 , with predominantly severe trial form and a treatment duration up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
most patients had a ser@@ o@@ con@@ ic version within 3 months of the beginning of the treatment , with a heavier follow @-@ up form in patients aged under 5 ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 years and older ) .
until the end of the Phase 3 study ( or up to a premature withdrawal from the study ) , no radio@@ immun@@ op@@ hili@@ c ( R@@ IP ) as@@ say showed det@@ ectable antibodies , including 3 patients with whom it never came to Ser@@ o@@ kon@@ version .
patients with a lack of up to low antibody levels demonstrated a robust decrease of the G@@ AG mirror in urine , while in patients with high antibody levels a variable reduction of G@@ AG in urine was determined .
four patients ( three in phase III study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a marginal to low neutr@@ al@@ ising inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic larv@@ ae activity in vitro , which did not appear to affect clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in urine .
the presence of antibodies did not appear to be associated with the incidence of adverse drug reactions , even if the incidence of adverse drug reactions were typically associated with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reason for the enzyme therapy is one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accum@@ ulative medium and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient enzyme activity .
after IV in@@ fusion , lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is quickly removed from the circulation and absorbed into the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely via mann@@ ose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors .
safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study to 45 patients aged 6 to 43 .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study that showed the entire disease spectrum , the majority of patients from the mean phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had an accelerated exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary efficacy end@@ points were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study where they received 100 E / kg of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me for another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) .
after 26 weeks of therapy , patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me showed improvement in lung function and the ability to sal@@ v@@ age treated in the following table .
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and 182 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as indicated in the following table .
the acceptance of the expected percentage FE@@ V is clin@@ ically not significant during this period and the absolute lung volumes increased propor@@ tionally to the body size of adults .
of the 26 patients with a h@@ ep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment 22 ( 85 % ) reached a normal liver size until the end of the study .
within the first 4 weeks , a clear decrease of the G@@ AG mirrors was detected in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) , which remained constant until the end of the study .
in view of the hetero@@ geneous disease incidence between the patients being taken into account by using a combined end point ( expected percentage of normal FE@@ V , distance in 6 @-@ minute walk , range of motion of the shoulder joint A@@ HI and visual acuity ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deterioration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) was observed .
a one @-@ year open phase 2 study was carried out , mainly investigating the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in 20 patients who were under 5 years old at the time of their inclusion ( 16 patients with severe course form and 4 with the mean follow @-@ up form ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to increased G@@ ag@@ - Mir@@ ror in Har@@ n in week 22 .
in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) were determined according to the Z score for this age group The younger patients with the mean follow @-@ up form showed a normal mental development rate , whereas in older patients with severe course of course only limited or no advances in cognitive development were determined .
in a phase 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dosing regi@@ mens were carried out on the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can be a reasonable alternative for patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing regi@@ mens is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review any new information available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the medicine will be updated .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients under the age of 5 was similar to those affected by older and less severely affected patients .
based on conventional safety har@@ mac@@ ology studies , toxic@@ ity in a single dose , toxic@@ ity in repeated dose and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot detect any particular dangers for humans .

A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another drug against cancer ) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy ( drugs against cancer ) and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( malign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) . • advanced or metastatic &quot; non @-@ small &quot; lung cancer that does not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used as sole treatment in patients who have not previously been treated in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chem@@ o@@ therapies .
to reduce side effects , the patients should take a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as foli@@ c acid ( a vitamin ) during the treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , an &quot; anti@@ em@@ etic &quot; ( medicines for vom@@ iting ) and liquids ought to be given before or after the administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( in order to prevent a lack of fluid ) .
in patients whose blood is changed or where certain other side effects occur , treatment should be delayed , removed or the dose should be less@@ ened .
the active form of P@@ tel@@ re@@ x@@ ed thus slow@@ s down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells being divided .
the transformation of p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed into its active form is easier in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the medicine and a longer active lifetime in cancer cells .
in a primary study , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in 4@@ 56 patients who had not previously received chemotherapy against their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer the A@@ lim@@ ta effects in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease , previously treated with chemotherapy , were compared with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another drug against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared to gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another drug against cancer ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study involving 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin survived on average 12.@@ 1 months , compared to 9.@@ 3 months in the all@@ otted administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
patients receiving chemotherapy prior to chemotherapy was the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta 8.3 months , compared to 7.@@ 9 months in doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
in both studies , however , patients in whom cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epitheli@@ al cells was longer survival times in the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta than with the comparison medication .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Eli Lil@@ ly Neder@@ land B.V. to launch A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union .
each flow bottle must be dissolved with 4.2 ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de inj@@ ections ( 9 mg / ml ) , resulting in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary dosage is taken from the flow bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de inj@@ ections ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see paragraph 6.@@ 6 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is indicated in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer , except for overl@@ apping plate @-@ epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with loc@@ alized or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer , except for overl@@ apping plate @-@ epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² of body surface ( KO@@ F ) is administered intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin amounts to 75 mg / m ² of KO@@ F as an in@@ fusion about a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after completion of the p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small cell lung cancer following previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is given as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
for the reduction of frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid must be given the day before and on the day after the treatment .
during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ tel@@ re@@ x@@ ed , a minimum of 5 doses of foli@@ c acid must be taken and the dose must be continued throughout the treatment period as well as for another 21 days after the last p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose .
patients must also receive an in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in the week before the first p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed dose , as well as after every third treatment cycle .
in patients receiving p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed , a complete blood picture should be created before each administration , including a differentiation of the leu@@ k@@ oc@@ ytes and a thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te count .
alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine @-@ trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ GP@@ T ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
a dose check must take place at the beginning of a new treatment cycle taking into account the N@@ adi@@ rs of the blood picture or the maximum non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the previous treatment cycles .
after recovery , patients need to be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 that apply for A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria are in line with the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 bleeding .
should patients develop non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ degree 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA has to be interrupted until the patient receives the value before the treatment
the treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA has to be canc@@ eled if a hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity degree 3 or 4 occurs in patients after 2 dose @-@ reduc@@ ti@@ o- or non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity level 3 or 4 or so - in case of Grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical studies showed no indication that in patients aged 65 years or above , an increased risk of side effects was increased compared to patients aged 65 years old .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy .
in clinical trials , no dose adap@@ tations were needed in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min , which go beyond the dose adap@@ tations recommended for all patients .
the data situation in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore , the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold upper B@@ ili@@ man@@ ia limit and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; the 3.0 @-@ fold upper limit value ( in case of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 times the upper limit value ( in presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not specifically investigated in the studies .
patients need to be sur@@ vei@@ lled with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression and P@@ tel@@ re@@ x@@ ed must not be given to patients before their absolute neutr@@ alisation returns a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ tes again has reached a value of ≥ 100.000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of the absolute number of neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils , thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ tes and maximum non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity observed in previous treatment cycles ( see section 4.2 ) .
a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction in level 3 / 4 ha@@ emat@@ ological and non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with degree 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was observed when a pre @-@ treatment with foli@@ c acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
therefore all patients with p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed need to be instructed to apply foli@@ c acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic measure to reduce treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to moderate ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid simultaneous use of non @-@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti @-@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds ) such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ s@@ ali@@ - cy@@ l@@ acid ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
all patients , for whom a therapy with P@@ tel@@ re@@ x@@ ed is intended , must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ life for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ tel@@ re@@ x@@ ed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
many patients with such occur@@ ren@@ ces had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing hyper@@ tension or diabetes .
in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid buil@@ du@@ p in the trans@@ cellular space a drainage of the eff@@ usion is planned before the P@@ tel@@ re@@ x@@ ed treatment .
5 severe cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials with p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed when this active ingredient is usually given in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance .
for this reason , the simultaneous use of atten@@ u@@ ated living vacc@@ ines ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of an ir@@ reversible degradation of the reproductive capacity by P@@ tel@@ re@@ x@@ ed , men should be advised against the treatment of the tin to obtain advice regarding the sperm conservation .
in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of non@@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage ( ≥ 1,3 g daily ) can lead to a reduced p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed ex@@ cre@@ tion with the result of an increased occurrence of side effects .
caution is advised if high doses of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or acet@@ amin@@ o@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid can be used in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days prior to therapy , to be avoided on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed ( see section 4.4 ) .
because there is no data regarding the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ life such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application with P@@ tel@@ re@@ x@@ ed must be avoided at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed .
the great in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of cl@@ ot@@ ting status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
no data is available for the use of emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - ren mul@@ timet@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites , serious birth defects are expected in the pregnancy .
tel@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed may not be used during pregnancy unless it is essential and after careful consideration of the benefit for the mother and the risk for the fo@@ etus ( see paragraph 4.4 ) .
since the possibility of an ir@@ reversible damage to the reproductive capacity by P@@ tel@@ re@@ x@@ ed , men should be advised to consult with regard to the sperm count .
it is not known whether p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed goes into breast milk and unwanted effects in the breast@@ fed baby can not be ruled out .
the following table shows the incidence and sever@@ ity of adverse effects reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma and the random@@ ised c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed , as well as 163 patients with mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma who were random@@ ized to receive c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy .

A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( P@@ tel@@ re@@ x@@ ed ) is an ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti@@ fol@@ ate that ex@@ erts its effect by interrup@@ ting the metabolic processes necessary for cell rep@@ lication .
in vitro studies showed that P@@ tel@@ re@@ x@@ ed acts as an anti@@ fol@@ ate with several points of attack by blocking the thy@@ roid syn@@ th@@ ase ( TS ) , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ u@@ cle@@ ot@@ ase ( DH@@ FR ) and Gly@@ cin@@ ami@@ dri@@ bon@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ d@@ for@@ - m@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase ( G@@ AR@@ FT ) , the following key enzymes in de nov@@ o bi@@ osyn@@ thesis of thy@@ mid@@ ine and pur@@ inn@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ des .
E@@ MP@@ HAC@@ IS , a multic@@ entre , random@@ ised , simple @-@ blind Phase 3 study of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA plus c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin against c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ous patients with mild ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma showed that patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin had a clin@@ ically significant advantage over those patients who were treated with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin alone .
the primary analysis of this study was conducted in the population of all patients receiving the treatment arm ( random@@ ized and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) in relation to the malign@@ ant ple@@ ural s@@ ell@@ eli@@ oma was shown in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the sole c@@ is@@ pla@@ yst@@ ine arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms were improved by improving lung function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and a wor@@ sen@@ ing of lung function over time in the control arm .
a multic@@ entre , random@@ ized , open phase III study with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSC@@ LC after chemotherapy , treated patients with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( Int@@ ent to treat population n = 28@@ 3 ) and from 7.@@ 9 months in patients treated with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( IT@@ T n = 28@@ 8 ) .
an analysis of the impact of hist@@ ology on the overall survival benefit of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in patients with NSC@@ LC with a predominantly non @-@ panel epitheli@@ al hist@@ ological type ( n = 3@@ 99 , 9.@@ 3 versus 7.@@ 4 months , adapted HR = 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 08 @-@ 2,@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) .
limited data from a separately random@@ ised controlled Phase 3 study indicate that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) pre @-@ treatment by doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el are similar .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analyses of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination to gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination .

the resulting solution is clear and the colouring varies from color@@ less to yellow or green@@ ish yellow , without compromising the quality of the product .
it is used in obes@@ e adults with a body mass index ( Body Mass Index - BM@@ I ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter combined with a low @-@ cal@@ orie , fatty diet .
patients who are taking allergy and are unable to lose weight after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if these enzymes are in@@ hibited , they can not break down some fats in the food , causing about a quarter of the fats led with food un@@ di@@ gest@@ ed the intest@@ ines .
in a third study , All@@ i was compared with placebo in 3@@ 91 over@@ weight patients with BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 .
in both studies in patients with BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who took All@@ i 60 mg took an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg in the intake of placebo .
in the study with All@@ i in patients with BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no relevant weight loss could be observed for patients .
the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily patches with the anus , fl@@ ur@@ inary tract ( winds ) with stu@@ g@@ lab@@ ia , stepped f@@ ume , gre@@ asy / o@@ ily chair , passage of o@@ ily secre@@ tion ( f@@ eces ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( winds ) and soft stools .
it must not be used in patients who are treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in transplan@@ t patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it may not be applied in patients suffering from long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syn@@ drom ( in which not enough nutrients are taken from the digestive tract ) or on cholesterol ( liver disease ) , and in pregnant or breast @-@ feeding mothers .
in July 2007 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o Group Limited to appro@@ ve the placing of Or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K in the European Union .
all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with over@@ weight ( Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a low hypo@@ cal@@ orie , fatty diet .
all@@ i must not be used by children and adolescents under 18 , as there is not enough data on efficacy and safety .
as Or@@ list@@ at is only minim@@ ally res@@ or@@ bed , it is not necessary to adjust the dosage to older persons and patients with reduced h@@ ep@@ atic and / or ren@@ al function .
• hyper@@ sensitivity to the active substance or any of the other components • Sim@@ ult@@ aneous treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see Section 4.6 ) • Chr@@ onic mal@@ absorption syn@@ drom • Cholest@@ asis • pregnancy ( see Section 4.6 ) • Sim@@ ult@@ aneous treatment with War@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see Sec@@ tions 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the probability of occurrence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) can increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich single @-@ meal or a fat @-@ rich diet .
as the weight reduction in diabetes can be associated with improved metabolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a therapy with all@@ i because the dose of anti@@ diabe@@ tic needs to be adapted if necessary .
patients who take all@@ i as well as medicines for hyper@@ tension or elevated cholesterol levels should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dose of these drugs has to be adapted .
it is recommended to take additional pregnancy @-@ prevention measures to prevent the possible failure of oral contrac@@ eption in case of severe diarr@@ ho@@ ea ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in a study on the interaction of pharmaceuticals as well as in several cases with simultaneous application of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , a decrease in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma glucose was observed .
when using war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick values ( international normal ratio , IN@@ R ) could be affected ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
most patients who were treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials up to 4 full years remained the concentration of vitamins A , D , E and K as well as beta @-@ car@@ ot@@ ene in the normal range .
however , the patient should be advised to take an additional mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time to ensure adequate vit@@ amine absorption ( see paragraph 4.4 ) .
after the administration of a one @-@ time dose A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one was observed with a limited number of healthy volunteers who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time , observed a slight decrease in the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration .
experimental studies showed no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal and are related to pharmac@@ ological effects of the drug , as the absorption of absorbed fat is prevented .
gastro@@ intestinal side effects were determined from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary .
the frequencies are defined as follows : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) .
the frequency of reported side @-@ effects noted after the introduction of or@@ list@@ at is not known , since these events were reported voluntarily by a population of a certain size .
† It is plau@@ sible that the treatment with all@@ i may lead to anxiety in terms of possible or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg of or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days in normal and over@@ weight subjects without significant clinical findings .
in most of the reported cases of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dose , no side effects or similar side effects were reported as reported at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on investigations on humans and animals , a rapid re@@ formation of possible systemic effects , which can be traced back to the li@@ sti@@ gu@@ ing properties of or@@ list@@ at , can be assumed .
the therapeutic effect prev@@ ails in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine by means of co@@ valent bonding to the active ser@@ ine remnant of ga@@ stri@@ c and p@@ ank@@ re@@ atic li@@ ds .
clinical studies have been derived that 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , have blocked absorption of approximately 25 % of the dietary fat .
two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , placebo @-@ controlled studies in adults with BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 att@@ est to the efficacy of 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ the@@ tical , fatty diet .
the primary parameter , the change in body weight compared to bas@@ eline ( at the time of random@@ ization ) , was evaluated as follows : a change in body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as part of those bor@@ ro@@ wers who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their original weight ( Table 2 ) .
although weight loss was observed in both studies over 12 months , the biggest loss of weight occurred in the first 6 months .
the average total dietary change in the Gesamt@@ cholest@@ erin occurred with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( bas@@ eline value 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 2.8 % ( bas@@ eline : 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average dietary change in LD@@ L cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( bas@@ eline value 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and placebo + 3.@@ 8 % ( bas@@ eline : 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average length of the waist was -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( starting value of 10@@ 3.@@ 7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( bas@@ eline 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non @-@ metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ urable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 n@@ g / ml ) .
7 In general , at therapeutic doses , non @-@ metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in plasma could only be detected spor@@ adic@@ ally and at extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 n@@ g / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of cum@@ ulation .
in a study of obes@@ e patients who administered the minimal systemic res@@ or@@ bi@@ ed dose , two main met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ zed Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after separation of the N @-@ form@@ yl @-@ leu@@ c@@ ine group ) , were identified , representing nearly 42 % of the total plas@@ ma@@ ize concentration .

please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the side effects listed will significantly affect you or notice any side effects that are not indicated in this information .
the most common side effects are related to the mode of action of the capsules and thereby result in increased fat leaving the body .
these side effects usually occur within the first few weeks of the treatment , as you may have not consistently reduced the fat percentage in your diet .
with the following basic rules you can learn to minim@@ ise nutritional supplements : start a few days or better a week before taking the capsules with a fatty diet . • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favourite foods and about the size of the portions that you normally take .
if you know exactly how much you eat , the likel@@ ihood of losing your fat limit decreases . • Distri@@ bute your recommended amount of fat evenly on daily meals .
save the amount of calories and fat that you may consume per meal , not to take them in the form of a fat @-@ rich main dish or a substantial dessert , as you may have done in other programs for weight reduction .

being over@@ weight has an impact on your health and increases the risk of developing various serious diseases such as : • hyper@@ tension • Diabetes • Heart disease • stroke • Cer@@ tain@@ ly cancers • Oste@@ o@@ arthritis Contact your doctor about your risk for these diseases .
permanent weight loss , for example by improving diet and more exercise , can prevent serious diseases and have a positive impact on your health .
choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients and gradually learn to eat heal@@ th@@ ily .
energy is also measured in kilo@@ j@@ oules , which you can also find in food packaging . • The recommended cal@@ orie intake indicates how many calories you should consume at maximum per day .
note the tables below in this paragraph . • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat that you should take with each meal .
take a look at the information below to determine the number of calories you need . • Due to the capsule &apos;s mode of action , compliance with recommended fat intake is crucial .
if you take the same amount of fat as before , this can mean that your body can not handle this amount of fat .
by adher@@ ing to the recommended fat intake , you can maximize the weight loss and at the same time reduce the likel@@ ihood of nutritional supplements . • You should try to decrease progres@@ sively and continuously .
this reduced cal@@ orie intake should allow you to gradually and continuously lose about 0.5 kg per week , without developing fru@@ strations and dis@@ appointments .
the more active you are , the higher your recommended cal@@ orie intake . • &quot; Lack of physical activity &quot; means that you do daily only little or no steps , work in the garden or perform other physical activities . • &quot; Medium physical activity &quot; means that you burn 150 k@@ cal per day , for instance by 3 km walk , 30@@ - to 45 @-@ minute gardening work or 2 km running in 15 minutes .
• For permanent weight loss , it is necessary to set realistic cal@@ orie and fat targets and also adhere to them . • Sinn@@ ers is a nutritional journal with information on the cal@@ orie and fat content of your meals . • T@@ ry to move more before you start taking all@@ i .
the all@@ i program supporting weight loss combines the capsules with a nutrition plan and a large number of other information materials that can help you nour@@ ish yourself with calcium and fatty acids and give guidelines to become more physically active .
in combination with a program tailored to your type to support weight loss , this information can help you develop a heal@@ thier lifestyle and achieve your target weight .
al@@ op@@ xi is used for chem@@ o@@ therapies which are strong triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , and chem@@ o@@ therapies which are moderate triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , d@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be increased by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid ( a drug that can be used as an anti@@ em@@ etic drug ) .
the use in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended as there is not enough information about the effects of this age group .
this means that the active ingredient is preventing the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines .
in three main studies , Alo@@ xi was examined in 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chem@@ o@@ therapies which are strong or moderate triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting .
chem@@ o@@ therapies , the strong cause of nausea and vom@@ iting , showed 59 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 132 by 2@@ 23 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 2@@ 21 ) .
chem@@ o@@ therapies , the moderate cause of nausea and vom@@ iting , showed 81 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 of 18@@ 9 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) .
in comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
March 2005 , the European Commission granted approval for the marketing of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union to the company Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd .
Alo@@ xi is indicated in the prevention of acute nausea and vom@@ iting in severely em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , as a result of cancer and for the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting in random@@ ly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , due to cancer .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi to prevent nausea and vom@@ iting , which is induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be enhanced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid before chemotherapy .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the col@@ on massage , patients with an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ an ob@@ sti@@ pation or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us should be closely monitored after the injection .
as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , however , caution is advised with the simultaneous administration of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients where the Q@@ t interval is extended or which tend to such an extension .
apart from chemotherapy , in the days following chemotherapy , Alo@@ xi is not to be used for prevention or treatment of nausea and vom@@ iting .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not in@@ hibit the activity of the five chem@@ o@@ therapeutic drugs examined for tum@@ ours ( c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) .
in a clinical study there was no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a ste@@ ady stat@@ e- concentration of oral met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ ami@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis showed that the simultaneous administration of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one and ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) as well as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 In@@ hibit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , D@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , Flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , R@@ ani@@ ti@@ dine , rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , Ser@@ tr@@ aline and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ ine ) had no significant effect on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experiences for the use of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies are not available , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the treating physician .
in clinical trials , the most common side effects observed at a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , possibly associated with Alo@@ xi , were head@@ ache ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ pation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the location ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing experience reports .
in the group with the highest dosage there were similar frequencies of adverse events as in the other dosage groups ; there were no dose @-@ activity relationships to be observed .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were conducted , but due to the large distribution volume , di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not effective in al@@ oh@@ xi@@ - over@@ dosing .
in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients receiving moderate to eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of dex@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 micro@@ grams of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were treated with patients who received 32 mg On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( half @-@ life : 7.@@ 3 hours ) , which was given day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one intraven@@ ously .
in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study , a total of 6@@ 67 patients receiving a strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and d@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ zin and 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were treated with patients who received 32 mg of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron , which were given intraven@@ ously on day 1 .
results from the studies of random@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study with strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summar@@ ised in the following tables .
in clinical trials for indication of chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were comparable to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ t@@ c interval with the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
following clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization and extend the duration of the action potential .
the aim of the study carried out in 2@@ 21 healthy volunteers was the evaluation of the EC@@ G effects of intraven@@ ous pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
following intraven@@ ous administration , a slow elimination of the plasma concentrations comes from the body with an average half @-@ life of approximately 40 hours on an initial decrease in the plasma concentrations .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area under the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally dose @-@ proportional in the entire dose range of 0.@@ - 90 m / kg in healthy and cancer patients .
following intraven@@ ous dosage of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean ( ± SD ) increase in the pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34 % between day 1 and day 5 .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simul@@ ations indicate that at once daily intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 25 mg of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable to a value measured after a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous dosage of 0.@@ 75 mg ; however , the C@@ MA@@ X was 0.@@ 75 mg higher .
about 40 % are eliminated by the kidneys and about another 50 % are converted into two primary met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites , which have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor compared to pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
in @-@ vitro studies on metabolism have shown C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , to a lesser degree , the is@@ o@@ enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elimination following an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , approximately 80 % of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine , pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as un@@ modified ingredient made about 40 % of the given dose .
after a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous bol@@ us injection , total body temperature was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
although in patients with severe liver dysfunction the terminal elimination diet and the average systemic exposure with pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are increased , however , a reduction of the dose is not justified by this .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions which are considered sufficient above the maximum human therapeutic exposure , suggest@@ ing little relevance for clinical use .
10 In prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , evidence has shown that pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block in very high concentrations of ion channels involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization and extend the duration of action .
high doses of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose was expressed in approximately the 30@@ x of the therapeutic exposure in humans ) , which were given daily for over two years resulted in increased incidence of liver tum@@ ors , en@@ doc@@ rine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid , p@@ itu@@ itary , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al mar@@ row ) and skin tum@@ ors in rats , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but because of the high dos@@ ages used and since Alo@@ xi is determined by humans for one @-@ time use , the relevance of these results is regarded as low for humans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the owner of this approval for placing on the market must inform the European Commission on the plans for placing the drug approved in the framework of this decision . &quot; &quot; &quot;

June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) approved a negative report recommended by the Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution prescribed for the treatment of hepatitis C for the treatment of hepatitis C .
this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should resem@@ ble a biological medicinal product called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same veter@@ an ingredient that is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; Reference for Reference for Reference for Reference for Reference for Reference for Reference for Reference for Reference for Reference for Reference for Reference . &quot;
Al@@ ph@@ el@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long lasting ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease caused by viral infection ) .
in a micro@@ scopic examination the liver tissue damage , in addition , the liver enzymes of Alan@@ in Amin@@ o ran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are ab@@ norm in the blood .
it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which stimulates them to form the active substance .
the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon presented data showing the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( drug structure , composition and purity of the drug , effectiveness , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) .
in the study on patients with hepatitis C , the efficacy of Al@@ ph@@ eon was compared with the efficacy of the reference drug to 4@@ 55 patients .
the study measured how many patients responded to the drug after 12 of a total of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after the treatment was stopped ( i.e. no evidence of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Au@@ thor@@ ised for non business purposes only provided the E@@ MEA is acknowledged .
in addition , concerns have been expressed that data on the stability of the drug and the drug being marketed are not sufficient .
the number of patients with hepatitis C that responded to treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eas@@ ant and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in the clinical study .
after treatment with Al@@ ph@@ el@@ eon , the disease was more likely to appear in more patients than with the reference drug , Al@@ ph@@ eon has had more side effects .
apart from this , the test used in the study was to determine the extent to which the medication triggers an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - specific proteins - against the medicine ) , not sufficiently vali@@ dated .
it can be used to treat im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection with cr@@ ust formation ) and small infected la@@ ins ( crack or cut wounds ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ wn wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections that have been proven or likely caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lin@@ drug @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ con may not work against this type of infections .
al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients at the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years of age , the skin area to be treated should not exceed 2 % of the body surface .
if the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial Ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced ) and thereby in@@ hi@@ bits the growth of bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was cleared after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients under placebo matched the treatment .
in the treatment of infected skin wounds , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : when the results of both studies were taken together at home rounds , approximately 90 % of patients in both groups responded to treatment .
in these two studies , however , it was found that Al@@ tar@@ go was not effective enough in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( ice @-@ filled cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or of infections caused by MR@@ SA .
the most frequent side effect with al@@ tar@@ go ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is an irrit@@ ation at the order .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go out@@ weigh the risks in the short @-@ term treatment of the following superficial skin infections : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small in@@ firm@@ ations , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o Group Ltd. to appro@@ ve Al@@ tar@@ go in the European Union .
patients with no improvement within two or three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in case of a sensi@@ tization or serious local irrit@@ ation by using ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment , the treatment is broken off , the o@@ int@@ ment is carefully wi@@ ped and an appropriate alternative treatment of the infection is started .
retin@@ am@@ ulin is not to be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known as patho@@ gen or is suspected ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials of secondary infected open wounds the efficacy of retin@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) was insufficient .
alternative therapy should be considered if there is no improvement or deterioration of the infected spot after a 2 to 3 day treatment .
the effects of the simultaneous use of retin@@ os@@ ulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface have not been examined and the simultaneous use of other topical pharmaceuticals is not recommended .
due to the small plasma concentrations that were achieved in humans after topical application on sk@@ ul@@ ed skin or infected superficial wounds , a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not expected ( see Section 5.2 ) .
3 After the simultaneous oral administration of 2 times daily 200@@ mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole the mean retin@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ X increased after topical application of 1 % retin@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment on sk@@ ul@@ ed skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to the low systemic exposure after topical application in patients , dosage adjustment is not considered necessary if topical re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is applied during systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral ing@@ es@@ tion and are inadequate in relation to a statement on effects on the birth and fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
retin@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment should only be used during pregnancy if a topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of retin@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the administration of a systemic antibiotic .
in deciding whether breast@@ feeding will continue / stop or cease treatment with Al@@ tar@@ go , it is necessary to weigh between the benefit of breast@@ feeding for the inf@@ ant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for woman .
in clinical trials involving 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections , the Al@@ tar@@ go was the most widely reported side @-@ effect irrit@@ ation at the location , which affects approximately 1 % of the patients .
mode of action Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deri@@ v@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance isolated by fermentation of cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ wort tet@@ anus ( formerly P@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ angled ) .
the action mechanism of retin@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding point of the 50 s sub@@ unit of the bacterial Ri@@ bos@@ ome , which differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicates that the binding site ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L@@ 3 is involved and lies in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding site and the pe@@ p@@ tide transfer centre .
binding on this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line in@@ hi@@ bits pe@@ p@@ tide transfer , blocking partially P @-@ binding interactions and prevents the normal formation of active 50@@ s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units .
if the local pre@@ valence of resistance specifies the use of retin@@ am@@ ulin at least some types of infection , advice should be as@@ pi@@ red by experts .
there were no differences in the in @-@ vitro activity of retin@@ am@@ ulin to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in case of non @-@ response to the treatment with S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tr@@ unks with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valent@@ ine leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
or@@ ption In a study with healthy adults , 1 % retin@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment was applied daily with oc@@ clu@@ sion to intact and lac@@ ed skin for up to 7 days .
of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % retin@@ os@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary @-@ infected traum@@ atic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained .
sampling was performed on days 3 or 4 in adult patients before the medication and the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual systemic inclusion in humans after topical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment on 200 c@@ m2 of S@@ cra@@ cked skin ( C@@ MA@@ X = 22 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 n@@ g · h / ml ) 6@@ 60 times lower than the retin@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for the P@@ GP inhibit@@ or .
metabolism The in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of retin@@ os@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ s was primarily conveyed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , lower participation of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in studies of oral toxic@@ ity to rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ roid changes .
in @-@ vitro analysis on gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in mouse @-@ lymph@@ oma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes as well as in rats micro @-@ nucle@@ us for in @-@ vi@@ vo study of chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
there was neither male nor female rats signs of reduced fertility in oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , whereby exposure to 5 times higher exposure was achieved than the highest estimated exposure in humans ( topical application on 200 c@@ m2 of sk@@ ewed skin ) :
in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study on rats at oral dos@@ ages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( according to the ≥ 3 times of estimated human exposure ( see above ) , development ox@@ ic@@ ity ( decreased body weight of fet@@ us and delayed Os@@ si@@ fication ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity were determined .

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children between 1 and 15 years , which are not immune to these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is used as part of a two @-@ dose vacc@@ ination plan , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered .
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during imm@@ uni@@ zation and ensures that the existing vacc@@ ination plan can be brought to an end by two doses .
if a refres@@ her dose is desired against hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix or other hepatitis B or B vaccine may be given .
vacc@@ ines act by contributing to the immune system ( the body &apos;s natural defence ) , as it can defend itself against a disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system detects viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; foreign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and produces antibodies against it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ambi@@ rix contains the same ingredients as the vacc@@ ination approved since 1996 , which has been approved since 1996 and the vacc@@ ination I have approved since 1997 .
the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , however , Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix are given children as part of an existing vacc@@ ination plan .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ rix adults were also used as evidence for the application of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator of efficacy was the share of vacc@@ inated children , who had developed a protective antibody concentration a month after the last injection .
in an additional study with 20@@ 8 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six month and a 12 month gap between the two inj@@ ections .
Ambi@@ rix caused a month after the last injection to develop protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B , between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ ani was similar in six and a 12 month gap between the inj@@ ections .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed with more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses ) are head@@ ache , loss of appetite , pain at the injection point , redness , fatigue , and irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix may not be applied in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other ingredients or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
in August 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit to the Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ c@@ als Company .
the certificate for basic imm@@ uni@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ ines , the first dose is given at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a refres@@ her vacc@@ ination is desired for both hepatitis A and hepatitis B , vacc@@ ination vaccine or combination vaccine may be vacc@@ inated with the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
the anti @-@ hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus are in the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
it is not yet fully assured whether immun@@ o@@ competent individuals who have addressed a Hepatitis A@@ - vacc@@ ination need a refres@@ her vacc@@ ination as protection , since they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory in case of no longer det@@ ectable antibodies .
3 As with all injection vacc@@ ines , appropriate medical treatment and monitoring options should always be available for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after vacc@@ ination .
if a quick protection against hepatitis B is required , the combination vaccine is recommended with the combination vaccine that contains 360 ELISA units form@@ alin @-@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in the case of hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with immune system disorders , there may be no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody @-@ value , so that in these cases the administration of further vacc@@ ines may be necessary .
since an intra@@ der@@ mal injection or in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular administration could result in a sub@@ optimal in@@ efficacy in glut@@ eal muscles , these injection path@@ ways should be avoided .
in the case of thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or blood cl@@ ot@@ ting , Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneously , because in these cases the in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular administration can lead to ble@@ ed@@ ings .
when Ambi@@ rix was administered in the second year of life with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ a- , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ us@@ - , in@@ activated pol@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis and Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type b vaccine , the immune response was sufficient for all anti@@ gens ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects it must be assumed that there may be no adequate immune response .
in a clinical study conducted with 3 vacc@@ ines of this formulation in adults , the incidence of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ch@@ iness , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , head@@ ache and fever was similar to the frequency observed in the earlier thi@@ omer@@ isation and preser@@ v@@ ative @-@ containing vaccine formation .
in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ines were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines ranging from 1 to 15 years .
in a study with 300 participants aged 12 to 15 years , the toler@@ ability of Ambi@@ ani was compared to that of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and fatigue on a basis of calculation per V@@ acc@@ dose Ambi@@ rix , but not on a basis of calculation per person .
pain was observed after the administration of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 0.@@ 7 % of subjects , compared with 3@@ 9.@@ 1 % in subjects following the dose of a 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
after the complete vacc@@ ination , 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of the subjects who received Ambi@@ rix were about pain , versus 6@@ 3.@@ 8 % in subjects vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
the frequency of mat@@ ch@@ iness was , however , comparable highly per pro@@ band ( i.e. over the entire vaccine cycle at 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of subjects who received Ambi@@ rix , compared with 3@@ 6.2 % in subjects who received the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine ) .
the frequency of pronounced pain and mat@@ ch@@ iness was low and comparable to those observed after the combination vaccine was observed with the 3 @-@ dose regi@@ mental diagram .
in a comparative study at 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ old vacc@@ ines , the incidence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ group was comparable to that observed when ad@@ minist@@ ering with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in the 6@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix a more frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , was reported .
the share of vacc@@ ines reported on severe side effects during the 2 @-@ dose regi@@ men with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ dose vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was not statisti@@ cally different .
in clinical trials conducted in the age of 1 to 15 years , the serum levels of anti @-@ HA@@ V were 9@@ 9.1 % one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second dose to be administered ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the serum levels for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4.2 % one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second , to the month 6 given dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study conducted between 12@@ - and 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 were given the standard combination vaccine with three doses .
in the 28@@ 9 people whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was worth@@ less , the Ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ect@@ ins ( SP in the table below ) against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 were significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix in the month of 2 and 6 after administration of the 3 @-@ can vaccine .
the responses received in a clinical comparative study at 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds one month after completion of the full vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. in month 7 ) are listed in the following table .
in both studies , the vacc@@ ines received either a 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies was detected at least 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination .
the immun@@ ological reaction observed in this study versus both anti@@ gens was comparable to that observed after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds could be demonstrated that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies is comparable 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme compared to the in the 0 @-@ 12 months vacc@@ ination scheme .
if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix in the second year of life was administered simultaneously with the discovery of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ a- , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ e- , in@@ activated pol@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis and 8 Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type b vaccine , the immune response was sufficient for all anti@@ gens .
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the present formulation in adults showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ect@@ al and serum recommendations similar to previous formulation for the current formulation .
the vaccine is to be examined both before and after the res@@ us@@ pen@@ ing of any foreign particles and / or physically visible changes .
according to article 114 of Directive 2001 / 83 / EC , the State batch release is carried out by a state laboratory or a laboratory authorized for this purpose .

the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted by viral ingredients and beverages , but can also be transmitted by other means , such as water contaminated by waste water .
you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( ja@@ un@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may make a stationary treatment necessary .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix can not protect completely from infection with Hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vacc@@ ination series has been completed with 2 doses .
if you / your child is already infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus prior to the administration of both doses ( even though you / your child feel un@@ well or sick at the time of the vaccine ) , vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those of hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection cannot be medi@@ ated .
• If you / your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any component of this vaccine including Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction can manifest through it@@ chy skin ras@@ hes , breath or swelling of your face or tongue . • If you / your child has already performed an allergic reaction to a previous vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B , if you / your child has a severe infection with fever .
• If you want to have a quick protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and prior to the scheduled administration of the second dose ) .
at a possible risk of hepatitis B infection between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you on vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix .
instead , it will recommend 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per vacc@@ ination ( 360 ELISA units of a de@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ) .
the second vacc@@ ination of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually given one month after the first dose and is likely to give you / your child a vacc@@ ination before ending the vaccine series .
sometimes Ambi@@ rix is inj@@ ected with persons suffering from severe blood cl@@ ots , under the skin and not in the muscle . • If you / your child is weakened due to illness or treatment in your / her body &apos;s immunity / is or if you / your child sub@@ tract or sub@@ tract a hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis .
Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals on vacc@@ ination may not be sufficient so that a blood test may be necessary to see how strongly the response to vacc@@ ination is .
21 Tell your doctor if you / your child takes more medicine ( including those that you can get without prescription ) or if you / your child has been vacc@@ inated or has been given immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ine ( antibodies ) or has planned this in the near future .
however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine is to be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate areas and as different limbs as possible .
if Ambi@@ rix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually , Ambi@@ rix will not be given pregnant or breast@@ feeding women unless it is urgently needed to be vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B. &quot; &quot; &quot;
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix . please inform your doctor if you have already demonstrated an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
if you miss the agreed date for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible .
♦ very often ( more than 1 case per 10 im@@ min@@ ed doses ) : • pain or discomfort on the insertion site or redness • Mat@@ ching • irrit@@ ability • head@@ ache • lack of appetite
♦ often ( up to 1 case per 10 im@@ min@@ ed doses ) : • swelling at the injection point • fever ( above 38 ° C ) • drow@@ sin@@ ess • gastro@@ intestinal complaints
other side effects that were reported days or weeks after vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or single vacc@@ ines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B are very rare ( less than 1 case per 10,000 de@@ generated doses ) are reported :
these include spati@@ ally limited or extended ras@@ hes , which can be it@@ chy or ves@@ ar @-@ shaped , swelling of the eye area and face , start@@ ling breathing or swal@@ lowing , sudden blood pressure drop and un@@ consciousness .

23 . inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if one of the side effects listed you / your child will significantly affect you or you notice any side effects that are not indicated in this package .
Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
on the basis of the data , which have become known since the issu@@ ance of the first permit for placing on the market , the CH@@ MP assumed that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ ani remains positive .
since Ambi@@ rix was only placed in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this medicine is limited due to the low patient exposure .
ammon@@ ia can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with in@@ complete enzyme defect or with hyper@@ ammon@@ ium ende@@ mic en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage as a result of high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in the pre@@ history .
ammon@@ ia is distributed - divided into several single doses at meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed into food or administered via a gastro@@ stom@@ i@@ es@@ l@@ auch ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach leading tube ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose into the stomach leading tube ) .
it was not a comparative study , because Am@@ mon@@ t@@ aps could not be compared with another treatment or placebo ( a placebo ( i.e. without active ingredient ) .
Am@@ mon@@ t@@ aps can also lead to loss of appetite , abnormal levels of acid in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , head@@ ache , f@@ ain@@ ting , fluid retention , stomach pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ pation , rash , unpleasant body odor or weight gain .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that ammon@@ ia was effectively prevented from high ammon@@ ia levels in patients suffering from disorders of the ure@@ a cycle .
ammon@@ ia was approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; because of the r@@ arity of the disease at the time of admission only limited information on this medicine was available .
the use is indicated in all patients with a complete enzyme shortage already manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with a late @-@ manifest form ( incomplete enzyme defect , which mani@@ fests itself after the first life month ) there is an indication for the use if hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis exists .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form for infants , for children who are unable to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disorders .
the daily dose is calculated individually , taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake needed for growth and development .
according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of more than 20 kg , as well as in adolescents and adults .
for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of carb@@ am@@ eth@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ in@@ tran@@ scar@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e , the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required .
patients with ar@@ gin@@ ine u@@ cc@@ inate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must receive ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be given to patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , as there is a risk for the formation of es@@ op@@ hag@@ us ul@@ cer@@ a when the tablets do not immediately enter the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used only with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency as well as with sodium retention and est@@ rogen production .
since metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at are carried out via the liver and kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should be used only with extreme caution in patients with liver or ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
the significance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats at high dosage ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) resulted in slow@@ ing neur@@ onal proliferation and increased neur@@ on loss .
there was also a delayed mat@@ ur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a hin@@ dran@@ ce to brain growth .
it could not be as@@ cer@@ tained whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted by humans into the mother &apos;s milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during breast@@ feeding ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , 56 % of patients had at least an adverse event ( AE ) and 78 % of these adverse events was assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1.000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an anom@@ al@@ ous 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ect@@ al disease , which developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in combination with lac@@ t@@ azi@@ dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , tank top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
an over@@ dose case occurred at a 5 month old inf@@ ant with an accidental total dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms proceed with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity in intraven@@ ous doses up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabolic active compound which is con@@ jug@@ ated by acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , which is ex@@ cre@@ ted via the kidneys .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 Pati@@ ents with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is produced for every gram between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival and clinical outcome .
the prog@@ nosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the appearance of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ aust , and the disease itself led to death even in the treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free analog@@ a in the first year of life .
ha@@ emo@@ di@@ aly@@ sis , the utilization of alternative methods of nit@@ ro@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced food and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ bor@@ ns in post@@ part@@ al ( but within the first life month ) diagnosed diseases to 80 % .
patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of the pregnancy and which were already treated before the first appearance of a hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even with these patients it came with time with many to mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its .
in patients with a late @-@ manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ got@@ es form of the or@@ ni@@ in@@ tran@@ scar@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e deficiency ) , which recovered from hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy and treated permanently with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and a protein @-@ reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible and in some patients a further wor@@ sen@@ ing of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur .
phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at is ox@@ idi@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ jug@@ ated to glut@@ amine in the liver and kidneys , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined after administration of a single dose of 5 g. of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at for so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in metabolism , and repeated doses of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( un@@ controlled studies ) .
phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites were also studied in cancer patients following intraven@@ ous administration of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral dose of 5 g. of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in tablet form 15 minutes after intake , meas@@ urable plasma concentrations were determined by phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
in the majority of patients with ure@@ a disease or hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) could not be phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in the next morning after ni@@ ghtly fasting .
in three out of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the liver , treated repeatedly with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three single doses ) the mean phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in the plasma gas label were five times higher on the third day than after the first gifts .
ex@@ cre@@ tion The drug is ex@@ cre@@ ted within 24 hours to about 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ jug@@ ated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
according to the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , NSC 631570 treated with toxic and non @-@ toxic dos@@ ages treated rats with no en@@ doc@@ rine effects ( examination 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules are either taken or@@ ally ( babies and children who can &apos;t swal@@ low tablets , or patients with hi@@ cc@@ ups ) or via a gastro@@ stom@@ i@@ es@@ kin or a nas@@ al probe .
according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of more than 20 kg , as well as in adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum protein in the plasma should be kept within the normal range .
for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of carb@@ am@@ eth@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ in@@ tran@@ scar@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e , the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5.4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium di@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
when rat fl@@ utes were exposed before the birth of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabolism of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ) , l@@ esi@@ ons in the pyr@@ am@@ idal cells of the cereb@@ ral cor@@ tex occurred .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an anom@@ al@@ ous 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ect@@ al disease , which developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in combination with lac@@ t@@ azi@@ dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , tank top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess
based on investigations on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at can be produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible for treatment , and in some patients a further wor@@ sen@@ ing of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur .
after an oral dose of 5 g. of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in gran@@ ular form 15 minutes after intake , meas@@ urable plasma concentrations were determined by phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
during the period of durability , the patient can keep the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of no more than 25 ° C .
in this procedure , the small measuring spoon contains 0.@@ 95 g , the mean measuring spoon 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
if a patient has to receive the medicine above a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ubil@@ ity of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at amounts to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing so that they cannot ex@@ crete the nit@@ ro@@ genous waste products that accum@@ ulate in the body after eating proteins .
if laboratory tests are carried out , you must inform the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS since sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at may affect the results of certain laboratory tests .

during breast@@ feeding you must@@ n &apos;t use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS since the medicine can blend into breast milk and harm your baby .
in rare cases also confusion , head@@ ache , taste disturbances , ob@@ struction of hearing , dis@@ orientation , memory impair@@ ment and a deterioration of existing neuro@@ logical conditions were observed .
if you encounter any of these symptoms , contact your doctor immediately or with the emergency room of your hospital for the purpose of initi@@ ating a suitable treatment .

An@@ gi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( ACS , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example in un@@ stable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the thor@@ ax with different starch ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; stress &quot; ( an anom@@ al@@ ous measured value in electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) .
if an@@ gi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients undergoing a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
nearly 14@@ ,000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of an@@ gi@@ ox was compared with sole administration or in conjunction with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another drug for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) compared to conventional combination therapy with He@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a GP@@ I .
during the PCI , the patient often became a st@@ ent ( a short tube left in the ar@@ tery to prevent a sh@@ utter ) and additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as Ab@@ ci@@ x@@ ima@@ b and aspir@@ in .
in the treatment of ACS , An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without the use of GP@@ I - was effective in preventing new events ( deaths , heart attacks or rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or a year altogether as effective as conventional treatment .
in patients undergoing a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was as effective as He@@ par@@ in in relation to all indicators , except for severe bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than He@@ par@@ in .
angi@@ ox may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , other brain p@@ ud@@ ine or any of the other ingredients .
it may not be used in patients who recently had a bleeding , as well as people with severe high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or heart infection .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that An@@ gi@@ ox during the treatment of ACS and during a PCI is an acceptable replacement for He@@ par@@ in .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd to appro@@ ve the launch of An@@ gi@@ ox in the entire European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( un@@ stable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ up@@ lift inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in case of emer@@ gen@@ cies or early intervention .
the recommended initial dose of an@@ gi@@ ox in patients with ACS is an intraven@@ ous bol@@ us of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if a PCI is additionally carried out for the patient , an additional bol@@ us of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery is increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
according to the PCI , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours after clinical needs .
immediately before the procedure a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the surgery .
the recommended dosage of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous bolt of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and an immediate intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
the safety and efficacy of any bol@@ us administration of An@@ gi@@ ox has not been examined and is not recommended even if a short PCI operation is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to less than 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should be achieved .
in order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted pharmaceuticals should be carefully mixed before application and the bol@@ us dose should be administered intraven@@ ously .
as soon as the ACT is more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1,@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly .
for patients with severe kidney function restriction ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to a PCI ( whether treated with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din vs. ACS or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT is less than 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0,3 mg / kg must be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dose is checked again .
in patients with severe kidney damage which were included in the Phase II PCI Study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which resulted in admission , the ACT is 5 minutes after administration of the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din @-@ Bol@@ us with no dose adaptation at an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients angi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
treatment with An@@ gi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after completion of IV administration of un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated He@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low molecular he@@ par@@ in .
• serious hyper@@ sensitivity to active substance or other constitu@@ ents or against brain ud@@ ine • active ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ sis and / or ir@@ reversible cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders . • severe un@@ controlled hyper@@ tension and sub@@ acute bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and in di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially if bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see Section 4.5 ) .
even though most bleeding in arter@@ ial points occur in PCI patients under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) can occur in principle throughout bleeding .
in patients who are taking War@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ ine , a monitoring of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) should be considered to ensure that the value after the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din returns the level before the treatment .
from the knowledge of the mechanisms of action of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te aggregate ) , it can be assumed that these agents increase the risk of bleeding .
the combination of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din with thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ations or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants is the clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ ase@@ ology parameters in each case to be monitored regularly .
in relation to effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , dis@@ connection or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .

in both the bi@@ valent group and the groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women and patients over the age of 65 were more likely to have adverse events than in male or younger patients .
severe bleeding has been defined in accordance with AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i standards for severe hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges as defined in table 2 foot@@ notes .
both light and severe bleeding occurred under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din alone significantly less frequently than in groups with He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ - In@@ hibit@@ or plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ - In@@ hibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
an AC@@ U@@ ITY heavy bleeding was defined as one of the following events : in@@ trac@@ ran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular bleeding or bleeding in the point area , reduction of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in levels of ≥ 3 g / dl with known blood cell , re@@ operation due to bleeding , application of blood products for trans@@ fusion .
other , less frequently observed blood loc@@ ali@@ zations , which occurred at more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) , were &quot; other &quot; point positions , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or throat .
the following information about side effects is based on data from a clinical trial with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI .
in both the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din Group and the groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women and patients over 65 years were more likely to have adverse events than in male or younger patients .
both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less among bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ ine than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
the following side effects , which are not listed above , have been reported in practice after exhaus@@ tive use and are grouped by system organ@@ classes in Table 6 .
in case of over@@ dose , the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din is to be stopped immediately and the patient is close mes@@ hed with regard to signs of bleeding .
angi@@ ox contains bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , a direct and specific aroma inhibit@@ or that bin@@ ds both the cataly@@ tic centre and the ani@@ on binding region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , regardless of whether it is trapped in the liquid phase or cl@@ ot@@ ting .
the Bin@@ ding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din to Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and with it its effect , is reversible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is slowly spl@@ itting up the bond of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , which re@@ generates the function of the active centre of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in .
in addition , it was not possible to indu@@ ce a thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ie / he@@ par@@ in@@ indu@@ ci@@ ated thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ie / he@@ par@@ in@@ indu@@ ci@@ ated thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ie / he@@ par@@ in@@ indu@@ ci@@ ated thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ indu@@ ci@@ ated thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ indu@@ ci@@ zed thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) .
in healthy volunteers and in patients , Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din shows a dose and concentration @-@ dependent an@@ tic@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect that is demonstrated by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT .
if a PCI was subsequently carried out below , an additional bolt of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din was to be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery is increased to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h .
in arm A of the AC@@ U@@ VC study un@@ frac@@ tional He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( ACS ) in patients with un@@ stable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ up@@ lift inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in Arm A and B were also random@@ ized to obtain a GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or prior to angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ ization ) or with the PCI .
in the AC@@ U@@ VC study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients who required angi@@ ography in 72 hours were spread evenly over the 3 arms .
about 77 % of patients had a recurring isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EK@@ G changes or increased cardiac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and about 99 % of all patients underwent angi@@ ography within 72 hours .

clinical trials with a small number of patients provided limited information on the application of angi@@ ox in patients with H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din were evaluated in patients subjected to a perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) and in patients with ACS .
it is expected that Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din is running a cat@@ aboli@@ sm in its amino acid components with subsequent re@@ valuation of amino acids in the body pool .
the primary metabolism resulting from the split of the AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 binding of the N @-@ terminal sequence through thro@@ mb@@ in is not effective because of the loss of its aff@@ inity to the cataly@@ tic center of thro@@ mb@@ in .
the elimination is done in patients with normal ren@@ al function after a first order process with a terminal half @-@ life of 25 ± 12 minutes .
based on conventional safety har@@ mac@@ ology studies , toxic@@ ity in repeated dose , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity or reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data does not reveal any particular dangers to humans .
the toxic@@ ity in animals with repeated or continuous exposure ( 1 day to 4 weeks at exposure to 10 @-@ fa@@ des of the clinical Ste@@ ady @-@ state plasma concentration ) was limited to over@@ shooting pharmac@@ ological effects .

diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate the glucose level ( sugar ) in the blood or the insulin is unable to work effectively .
insulin C@@ sin differs very slightly from human insulin , and the change means it works faster and has a shorter active lifetime than a short @-@ acting acting insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra was used in combination with a long @-@ term insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study involving 5@@ 72 children aged four to 17 years .

the main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood which indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
in the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes , a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was observed after six months compared to a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin resistance .
in adults with type 2 diabetes the lowering of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % in human normal insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin stimul@@ ant or any of the other ingredients , or in patients who already suffer from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may have to be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other drugs that may affect blood glucose levels .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Germany GmbH a licence for placing A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra is used as a sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of the abdominal wall , th@@ ig@@ h or the delta muscle or sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous in@@ fusion in the area of the abdominal cavity .
due to the reduced glu@@ con@@ ogen@@ esis capacity and the reduced insulin metabolism , the insulin requirement in patients with a restriction of the liver function can be reduced .
any change of the active strength , the brand ( producer ) , the insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc @-@ ret@@ ar@@ ded etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can change the insulin requirement .
3 An inadequate dosing or breakdown of a treatment , especially in patients with insulin @-@ based diabetes , may result in hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis . these conditions are potentially life @-@ threatening .
switching from one patient to another insulin type or an insulin belonging to another manufacturer should be carried out under strict medical supervision and can necess@@ itate a change in dosing .
the time of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia occurrence depends on the mode of activity of the insulin used and can therefore change when the treatment scheme is changed .
substances that increase blood sugar lowering activity and increase the inclin@@ ation to hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia include oral anti@@ diabe@@ tics , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ converting enzyme ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors , pent@@ ox@@ if@@ yl@@ ates , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , s@@ ali@@ z@@ yl@@ ates and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics .
in addition , under the effects of sympath@@ oly@@ tics like beta block@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ i@@ din , Gu@@ an@@ thi@@ din and reserves the symptoms of the adren@@ ergi@@ c anti@@ regulation can be weakened or missing .
experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ .@@ li@@ sin and human insulin regarding pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether insulin delivery occurs in human breast milk , but in general , insulin is not absorbed into breast milk , nor is it res@@ or@@ bed to oral use .
following the list of un@@ desirable drugs known from clinical trials , grouped by system organ@@ classes and ordered by decreasing frequency of their occurrence ( very common : ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10.000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10.000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10.000 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10 ; rarely estimated ( frequency based on the data available ) .
cold - wel@@ lia , cool and pale skin , fatigue , nerv@@ ousness or trem@@ ors , anxiety , unusual exhaus@@ tion or weakness , confusion , lack of concentration , ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness , excessive dog , head@@ ache , nausea and pal@@ pit@@ ations .
pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy A@@ chi@@ pped to continuously change the injection point within the injection unit , a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy may occur at the injection point .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias with un@@ consciousness can be treated by an in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , given by a su@@ itably trained person or treated by intraven@@ ous doses of glucose by a doctor .
after an injection of glucose , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and avoid similar episodes .
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose absorption ( especially skel@@ etal muscle and fat ) as well as by in@@ hibition of glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that at sub@@ cut@@ aneous ga@@ - be of insulin @-@ pleas@@ ers the effect occurs more quickly and the duration is shorter than with hu@@ - man@@ em normal insulin .
in a study with 18 male individuals aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes , insulin sensitivity in the therapeu@@ tically relevant dosing range of 0.0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg showed a dose of proportion@@ ate glu@@ cos@@ m lowering effect , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a dispro@@ portion@@ ate increase in the glu@@ cos@@ m lowering effect , just like human insulin .
insulin C@@ sin has a twice as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves the complete glu@@ cos@@ sing effect approximately 2 hours earlier than Human insulin .
from the data it was obvious that in an application of insulin @-@ lu@@ li@@ sin 2 minutes before the meal a comparable post @-@ pran@@ dial gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is reached , such as with human insulin analog , which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
if insulin assimil@@ ation was acquired 2 minutes before the meal , a better post@@ pran@@ dial control was achieved than with human insulin analog , which was given 2 minutes before the meal .
if insulin is turned 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal , a comparative gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved , such as the human insulin analog , which is given 2 mi@@ ds before the meal ( see Figure 1 ) .
insulin delivery in gift 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before the start of the meal compared to human common insulin , which was given 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min ) before the meal begins ( figure 1A ) before a meal was given ( Figure 1@@ B ) .
insulin stimul@@ ant in administration 15 minutes ( afterwards ) after the beginning of the meal compared to human tin @-@ insulin analog , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the beginning of the meal ( Figure 1@@ C ) .
