<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Safety Report (EPP), which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has evaluated the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need more information about your disease or treatment, please read the package insert (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you would like more information on the basis of CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, and 30 mg tablets, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as a solution for intake (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. wirl thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), distrust and insanity; • Bipolar I disorder, a mental disorder in which the patients have abnormal episodes (periods of abnormal calcidity) alternating with periods of normal atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for quick control of increased restlessness or behavioural disorders, if oral intake of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">For both diseases, the solution can be used for inserting or melting tablets in patients who have difficulty swallowing tablets.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who are taking other drugs as well as Abilify, the dose of Abilify should be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="10">This impairs the signal transmission between brain cells by "neurotransmitters," i.e. chemical substances that enable communication of nerve cells to one another.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazol is thought to be a "partial agony" for the neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazol acts like 5 hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but to a lesser degree than the neurotransmitters to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">As dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazol contributes to normalize the activity of the brain, thus preventing psychotic or manic symptoms and preventing their recurrence.</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of Abilify to prevent the recurrence of symptoms has been studied in three studies over up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar disorders, which suffered from increased unrest over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study Abilify was compared to 347 patients with haloperidol, in another study the effectiveness of Abilify and placebo to prevent recurrence to 160 patients, in which the manic symptoms had already been stabilized with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The effectiveness of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study to 301 patients with bipolar disorder that suffered from increased restlessness, compared to Lorazepam (another antipsychotic) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies the change in the symptoms of patients was examined using a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients responding to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies to examine how the body absorbs the melting tablets and the solution to take up.</seg>
<seg id="20">In both studies with the injection solution, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg, showed a significantly greater reduction in symptoms of increased restlessness compared to those who received placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the treatment of bipolar disorder Abilify decreased in four of the five short-term studies manic symptoms more effective than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">In addition, Abilify prevented the recurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients for up to 74 weeks and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10 or 15 mg doses also reduced more effective than placebo the symptoms of increased restlessness and were similarly effective as lauazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify for taking (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disorders (uncontrolled Zucken), somnolency (dizziness), seizure (distipation), seizure (increased saliva production), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and moderate to severe manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder and in the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and in which the manic episodes were related to the treatment with Aripiprazol versus the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the committee came to the conclusion that the advantages of the injection solution in quick control of increased restlessness and behavioural disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar I disorder, if oral therapy is not suitable, outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">June 2004, the European Commission granted approval to the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. for placing Abilify in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and whose manic episodes were related to the treatment with Aripiprazol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">Increased efficacy in dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven, although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once daily, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">Efficacy of Abilify in treating schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">Due to the greater sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors warrant this (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from the combination therapy, the recommended dosage should be reduced to the recommended dosage (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after the change of an antipsychotic therapy, even in treatment with Aripiprazol (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder there was no increased risk of suicide with Aripiprazol compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazol should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose to hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolaemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including acute and maligne form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Spätdyskinesia: in clinical studies lasting one year or less, there were occasional reports about dyskinesia performing with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="39">If signs and symptoms of late dysphfoliation occur in a patient treated with Abilify, should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">When a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of a mn, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be dismissed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Aripiprazol should be used with caution in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or in conditions associated with seizures.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazol in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients treated with Aripiprazol had an increased risk of death compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, there were in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant correlation between dosage and response to undesirable cerebrovascular events in patients treated with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with etoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no accurate risk assessments for hyperglycemia-related adverse events in patients treated with Abilify and other atypical antipsychotic agents who allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsy, polyurie, polyphagia and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be regularly monitored in relation to worsening glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar mania due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, where weight gain is known as a side-effect or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Aripiprazol on the central nervous system, caution is advised if Aripiprazol is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally active drugs with side effects such as sedation (see paragraph 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist famotidin, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the absorption rate of aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidine) increased the AUC of Aripiprazol by 107% while the CMAX remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore should be made similar dose reductions.</seg>
<seg id="52">In CYP2D6 'poor' (= 'poor') Metabolism the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazol compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="53">If one considers the joint administration of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3s inhibitors with Abilify, potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as istraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="55">After replacing the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitor, the dose of Abilify should be raised to the dose level before starting the adjuvant therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram or CYP2D6, together with Abilify, can be attributed with a moderate increase in aripiprazole concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical studies doses of 10-30 mg of aripiprazol per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the mediums of CYP2D6 (Dextrometamoran / 3-methoxymorphine-ratio), 2C19 (warfarin), 2C19 (obblezol) and 3A4 (Dextrometorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or planning a pregnancy during the treatment with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to the insufficient data situation for safety in humans and due to the concerns created in the reproduction studies at the animal, this drug may not be used during pregnancy unless the potential benefits clearly justifies the potential risk for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned against dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are certain that Aripiprazol has no negative influence on it.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following adverse events were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than under placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of side effects listed below is defined by the following criteria: frequent (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study over 52 weeks, patients treated with Aripiprazol showed a total reduced incidence (25.8%) of EPS including Parkinsonism, Akathisie, Dystonia and Dyskinesia, compared to patients treated with haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study for 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% in patients with Aripiprazol treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study for 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% in patients treated with Aripiprazol was 15.1% in patients with onicicle therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes in bipolar I disorder - In a controlled trial for 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 23.5% in patients with Aripiprazol- treatment and 53.3% in patients with haloperidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26.6% in patients with Aripiprazol treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">During the long-term study lasting more than 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 18.2% for patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% for placebo treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazol and placebo with potentially clinically significant changes in routine laboratory parameters did not reveal any medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Enhancements of CPK (creatine phosphosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed at 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazol compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">Adverse events related to antipsychotic therapy and their occurrence also reported in the treatment with Aripiprazol include malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and varicosis, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch unintentional or deliberate acute overdosages with Aripiprazol were observed alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and no deaths.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although there is no information on the efficacy of a hematalysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripiprazol; however, it is unlikely that hematalysis is beneficial in the treatment of an overdose because Aripiprazol has a high plasma protein binding.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of Aripiprazol in schizophrenia and bipolar I disturbance on the combination of a partial agonistic effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a-receptors is mediated.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripiprazol showed in vitro a high affinity to the dopamine D2- and D3 receptor and a moderate affinity to dopamine D4-, serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7, to alpha-1-adrenergic and histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">Using Aripiprazol in doses from 0.5 to 30 mg once daily over 2 weeks to healthy subjects, the positron emission tomography showed a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-Racloprid, D2 / D3 receptor ligands, at the nucleus caudatus and at the putstream.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) at 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazol showed a statistically significant improvement in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a haloperidol-controlled trial, 52 percent of responder patients with a response to the study were similar (Aripiprazol 77% and haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from measurement scales, defined as secondary study goals, including PANSS and Montgomery-Asberg- depression rate scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement than for haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study for 26 weeks in stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazol showed a significantly higher reduction in the rate of relapse, which was 34% in the Aripiprazol group and 57% under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Ostanzapine-controlled, multinational double blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks that included 314 patients and in which the primary study target 'weight gain' was, an increase of at least 7% compared with baseline (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg with an average weight of ca.).</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosage for 3 weeks with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, Aripiprazol showed a superior effectiveness in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, Aripiprazol showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo and active controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, Aripiprazol showed a placebo superior effectiveness in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">In week 12 Aripiprazol showed a comparable share of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania such as lithium or haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic features which partially did not apply to lithium or valproate monotherapy in therapeutic serum levels, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazol revealed a superior effectiveness in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproate.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled trial for 26 weeks followed by a long-term extension period for 74 weeks in manic patients who had remission with Aripiprazol during a stabilization phase before randomization, Aripiprazol showed superiority to placebo for prevention of a relapse into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the hydroxyprofiling and hydroxyprofiling of Aripiprazol, the N dealkyness is catalyzed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean elimination average is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazol in extensive metabolism via CYP2D6 and at nearly 146 hours at 'bad' (= 'poor') Metabolism via CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripiprazol there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy volunteers, as did pharmacokinetic investigation of schizophrenic patients show no gender-dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A stimulation-specific evaluation of pharmacokinetics did not reveal any clinically significant differences with respect to ethnic origin or the effect of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="92">Pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazol and Dehydro-Aripiprazol were similar in patients with severe renal insufficiency in comparison to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study in subjects with different hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of the liver function on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazol and Dehydro-Aripiprazol, but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of the class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional safety harmacology studies, toxicity in repeated dose, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential, the preclinical data could not reveal any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only in doses or expositions which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans so they have limited or no meaning for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included a dose-dependent by-kidney toxicity (lipofuscin-pigment accumulation and / or parenchymal loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 60 mg / kg / day (10 times the average steady state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, a cholelithiasis was detected as a result of the precipitation of sulphate conjugates of the hydroxy- metabolites of aripiprazol in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1- to 3 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, the concentrations found in the human bile at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg of the sulphate conjugates of hydroxy- aripiprazol do not exceed 6% of concentrations found in the study more than 39 weeks in the bile of apes and lie far below the limit values (6%) of in vitro-solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits, these effects were observed after doses, which lead to exposure of 3 and 11 times the middle steady state AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dosage.</seg>

<seg id="156">Nevertheless, the intensity of sedation was greater compared with the single dose of Aripiprazol, in a study where healthy volunteers aripiprazol (15 mg dose) was intramuscularly used and which at the same time received Lorazepam (2 mg doses) intramuscularly.</seg>
<seg id="157">The H2 antagonist famotidin, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the absorption rate of aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="158">In CYP2D6 'poor' (= 'poor') Metaboliers, the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="159">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as istraconazole and HIV- protease inhibitors, should have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made.</seg>

<seg id="167">During the long-term study lasting more than 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 18.2% for patients with Aripiprazol treatment and 15.7% for placebo treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="168">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazol and placebo with potentially clinically significant changes in routine laboratory parameters did not reveal any medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="169">Enhancements of CPK (creatinphosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed at 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazol compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>

<seg id="172">In a placebo-controlled short-term study (24 h) with 291 patients with bipolar disorder as well as angioptightness and behavioural disorders, the Aripiprazol injection solution was associated with a statistically significant greater improvement in symptoms of aggravation and behavioural disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lorazepam- reference arm.</seg>
<seg id="173">The mean improvement from the initial value observed on the PANSS Excitement Component score was 5.8 for placebo, 9.6 for Lorazepam and 8,7 for Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="174">In analyses of subgroups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe agility, a similar effectiveness has been observed in relation to the overall population, but a statistical significance could be determined on the basis of a reduced number of patients.</seg>
<seg id="175">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) at 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazol (oral) showed a statistically significant improvement in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="176">In a haloperidol-controlled trial, 52 percent of responder patients who were attending the study were similar in both groups (Aripiprazol 77% (oral) and haloperidol 73%).</seg>

<seg id="180">111 In a placebo-controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic features which partially did not apply to lithium or valproate monotherapy in therapeutic serum levels, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazol revealed a superior effectiveness in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproate.</seg>
<seg id="181">In a placebo-controlled study for 26 weeks followed by a 74-week study extension in manic patients who had achieved remission with Aripiprazol during a stabilization phase before randomization, Aripiprazol showed superiority to the prevention of a bipolar retreat, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="182">In the first 2 hours after intramuscular injection, the AUC Aripiprazol AUC is 90% larger than the dose of the same dose as tablet; the systemic exposure was similar between the two formulations.</seg>
<seg id="183">In 2 studies with healthy volunteers the average time of plasma treatment was 1 to 3 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="184">The administration of Aripiprazol injection solution was well tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxicity of a target organ after repeated dose in systemic exposure (AUC), which was intramuscular in 15- or 5 times above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg.</seg>
<seg id="185">Studies on reproductive toxicity after an intravenous application showed no safety-related concerns after maternal exposure, which was 15- (rats) and 29 times (rabbits) over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg.</seg>
<seg id="186">Based on conventional studies with Aripiprazol (oral) for safety harmacology, toxicity with repeated dose, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential, the preclinical data could not reveal any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="187">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only in doses or expositions which clearly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans; therefore they have limited or no meaning for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="188">The effects included a dose-dependent by-kidney toxicity (lipofuscin pigment accumulation and / or parenchymal loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 60 mg / kg / day (10 times the average steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="189">In addition, a cholelithiasis following the precipitation of sulphate conjugates of the hydroxy- metabolites of Aripiprazol has been detected in the gall of apes after repeated oral dose of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2).</seg>

<seg id="267">The effectiveness of Abraxane was investigated in a major study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer, three quarters of which had received an anthracycline.</seg>
<seg id="268">The effect of Abraxane (in sole administration or monotherapy) was compared with a medication containing a conventional paclitaxel (given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects).</seg>
<seg id="269">In total, 72 (31%) of 229 patients with Abraxane responded to the treatment, compared to 37 (16%) of the 225 patients who received conventional paclitaxel medicines.</seg>
<seg id="270">Only those patients who were treated for the first time in metastatic breast cancer have no difference in the efficacy indicators such as time to worsening disease and survival.</seg>
<seg id="271">In contrast, patients receiving other treatment of their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel treatments.</seg>
<seg id="272">It must also not be used in patients who have low neutrophils in the blood before the treatment begins.</seg>
<seg id="273">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) found that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel and that unlike other drugs, it should not be given to other medicines to reduce side effects.</seg>
<seg id="274">In January 2008, the European Commission issued a licence to the company Abraxane in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="275">Abraxane-Monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast carcinoma in patients with first-line treatment for metastatic disease and is not indicated for a standard anthracycline-containing therapy (see also section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="276">In patients with severe neutropenia (neutrophilology &lt; 0.50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer) or severe sensory neuropathy during the Abraxane therapy, the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series.</seg>
<seg id="277">In the case of sensorial neuropathy, the treatment must be interrupted until an improvement is reached on degree 1 or 2, and the dose must be reduced in all subsequent cycles.</seg>
<seg id="278">There is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adaptation in patients with mild to moderate liver function (see Section 4.4. and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="279">There were no studies with patients with impaired renal function and there is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adaptation in patients with impairment of kidney function (see Section 5.2).</seg>

<seg id="281">Abraxane is an albumin-bound nanoparticle formulation of Paclitaxel which could have significantly different pharmacological characteristics than other forms of paclitaxel (see section 5.1 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="282">If an allergic reaction occurs, the medicine should be removed immediately and a symptomatic treatment is initiated, and the patient must not be treated again with paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="283">In patients no new abyane treatment cycles should be initiated until the neutrophurism increased again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the thrombocyte count rises again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l.</seg>

<seg id="286">If nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea occur in patients after the administration of Abraxane, these can be treated with the usual antiemetic and constilling methods.</seg>
<seg id="287">Abraxane should not be used in pregnant women or women in childbearing age, who do not practice effective contraception, except for the treatment of the mother with paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="288">Women in childbearing age should apply a reliable contraception method during and up to 1 month after treatment with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="289">Male patients treated with Abraxane will be advised to not witness during and up to six months after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="290">Male patients should be advised of a sperm count prior to treatment, since the treatment with Abraxane is the possibility of irreversible infertility.</seg>

<seg id="292">Listed below are the most common and most important incidents of adverse events reported in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer, which were treated once every three weeks at 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane in the pivotal clinical phase III study.</seg>
<seg id="293">Neutropenia was the most prominent hematological toxicity (reported in 79% of patients) and was quickly reversible and dose-dependent; leukopenia was reported in 71% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="294">Anaemia (Hb &lt; 10 g / dl) was observed in 46% of patients treated with Abraxane and was severe in three cases (Hb &lt; 8 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="295">Side effects listed in Table 1 are the adverse events associated with the administration of Abraxane as monotherapy at each dose and indication in studies (N = 789).</seg>
<seg id="296">Very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100); rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1.000); very rare (&lt; 1 / 10.000).</seg>
<seg id="297">Occasionally: increased blood pressure, weight gain, increased lactic dehydrogenase in the blood, increased creatine in the blood, increased blood sugar, increased phosphorus in the blood, reduced potassium in the blood heart disease:</seg>
<seg id="298">Dysphagia, flatulence, tongue-burning, dry mouth, tender gums, loose stool, oesophagitis, sores in the lower abdomen, sores in the mouth, oral pain, rectal bleeding diseases of the kidneys and urinary tract:</seg>
<seg id="299">Pain in the chest wall, weakness of the muscles, neck pain, groin pain, muscle spasms, pain in skeletal muscles, back pain, discomfort in the limbs, muscle weakness Very common:</seg>
<seg id="300">Restlessness 1 The frequency of hypersensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definite case in a population of 789 patients</seg>
<seg id="301">Since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimate of actual incidence is possible and no causal connection with these occurrences has been established.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an antimikrotubules agent that promotes the consolidation of the microtubules from the tubule and stabilises the microtubules due to inhibition of their polymerisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to an inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganisation of the microtubular network, which is essential for the vital interphase and the mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that albumin mediates the transytosis of plasma components into endothelial cells and in the framework of in-vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of albumin promotes the transport of paclitaxel by endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this improved transendocorneal transport is mediated through the gp-60 albumin receptor and due to the albuminous protein SPARC (secreted protein acidic rich in cysteine), a paclitaxel accumulation occurs in the area of the tumor.</seg>
<seg id="306">The use of Abraxane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data of 106 patients in two single-arm unfaded studies and 454 patients treated in a randomized Phase III study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In a study 43 patients with metastatic breast carcinoma were treated with Abraxane, which was given in the form of an infusion about 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study, a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as infusion for about 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multicentre study was conducted in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received a monotherapy with paclitaxel every 3 weeks, either in the form of solvent containing paclitaxel 175 mg / m2 as a 3 hour infusion with pre-medication for preventing an allergic reaction (N = 225) or in the form of Abraxane 260 mg / m2 as 30-minute infusion without premedication (N = 229).</seg>
<seg id="310">In the study, 64% of patients had a compromised general condition (ECOG 1 or 2), 79% had visceral metastases and 76% had more than 3 metastases.</seg>
<seg id="311">14% of patients had previously not received chemotherapy, 27% had only one adjuvant chemotherapy, 40% only because of metastasis and 19% due to metastasis and adjuvant treatment.</seg>
<seg id="312">9 The results for the general response rate and time until progression-free survival and survival for patients receiving &gt; first-line therapy are shown below.</seg>
<seg id="313">Neurotoxicity compared to paclitaxel was evaluated by improving one degree for patients who experienced peripheral neuropathy at a time during therapy.</seg>
<seg id="314">The natural course of peripheral neuropathy to sound on baseline due to the cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and is still unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">The pharmacokinetics of the total paclitaxel after 30- and 180-minute infusions of Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="316">Exposure to active substances (AUC) increased linearly from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml, analogous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 After IV administration of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast carcinoma at the recommended dose of 260 mg / m2, the paclitaxel plasma concentration decreased in a multi-phase mode.</seg>
<seg id="318">The mean distribution volume was 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume points to far-reaching extravascular distribution and / or tissue binding of Paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study with advanced solid tumours, the pharmacokinetic properties of paclitaxel were compared to intravenous 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane with the values following a 3-hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">The Clearance of Paclitaxel was higher (43%) after the Abraxane dose (43%) than after a solvent containing paclitaxel injection, and the volume of distribution was higher at Abraxane (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In the published literature on in vitro studies of human liver microsome and tissue layers, it is reported that Paclitaxel is metabolized primarily to 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and to two smaller metabolites (3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3" -p-droxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast carcinoma, the mean value for cumulative urinary excretion of the unchanged drug was 4% of the given total dose of 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel, which points to far-reaching non-renal clearance.</seg>
<seg id="323">However, only a few data were available on patients at the age of more than 75 years, since only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmacokinetic analysis.</seg>
<seg id="324">Chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in the original box and above light light over 8 hours.</seg>

<seg id="359">This means that Abseamed is similar to a biodrug that is already approved in the European Union (EU) and contains the same active ingredient (also called "reference drug medicine").</seg>
<seg id="360">It is used in patients with normal blood transfusion values, in which complications may occur in connection with blood transfusion, if a blood circulation is not possible before the procedure and a blood loss of 900 to 1,800 ml is expected.</seg>
<seg id="361">Treatment with Abyamed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with illnesses for which the medicine is indicated.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make a blood donation, Abseamed has been injected into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="363">The injection can also be carried out by the patient or his supervisor, provided that they have received appropriate instructions.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency or in patients receiving chemotherapy, the haemoglobin values should always be recommended (between 10 and 12 grams per deciliter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron levels of all patients must be checked before treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency, and iron supplements should be administered during the entire treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients receiving chemotherapy, or in patients with kidney problems, anaemia may be caused by a erythropoietal defect or that the body does not adequately respond to the body's erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thereby reduce the consequences of a loss of blood.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced, which it empowers to the formation of epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">Abseamed was compared as injections into a vein as part of a major study involving 479 patients suffering from kidney problems caused anemia, compared with the reference drug.</seg>
<seg id="370">All patients participating in this study had been injected into a vene for at least eight weeks before being either renamed to Abseamed or continued receiving Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main indicator for the efficacy was the change in haemoglobin values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period in the weeks 25 to 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of Abseamed, injected under the skin, were analysed with those of Eprex / Erypo at 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study with patients suffering from kidney problems caused anaemia, the haemoglobin values of patients who were renamed to Abseamed were the same as those who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">In comparison, the patients who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo showed an increase of 0.063 g / dl of the starting value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common side effect of Abyamed is an increase in blood pressure, which can occasionally lead to symptoms of encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, stabbing migraine like headache and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">Abyamed may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to epoetin alfa or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="377">Abyamed as an injection under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems as further studies are required to ensure that no allergic reactions are caused.</seg>
<seg id="378">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that, according to the European Union regulations, it has been proved that the medicine has a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile such as Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="379">The company that manufactures abyamed will provide information packages to healthcare professionals across all Member States, including information on the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="380">In August 2007, the European Commission granted Medice Medicines Pütter GmbH & Co KG a licence for the placing of Abseamed in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="381">Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion needs in adults with solid tumours, malignant lymphoma or multiplier myeloma who receive chemotherapy and in which the risk of transfusion is due to the general condition (such as cardiovascular status, pre-existing anaemia prior to chemotherapy).</seg>
<seg id="382">Treatment should be performed only in patients with moderate anaemia (haemoglobin [Hb] 10 - 13 g / l], no iron deficiency), if blood-saving measures are not available or insufficient, in case of planned larger surgical procedures that require a large amount of blood (4 or more units of blood in men; 5 or more units of blood in men).</seg>
<seg id="383">For the reduction of foreign blood Abseamed can be used prior to a large elective orthopedic intervention in adults with no iron deficiency, in which a high risk of transfusion complications can be expected.</seg>
<seg id="384">HB 10-13 g / dl) and an expected drop of blood of 900-1800 ml will be used, which cannot participate in an autologous blood donation program.</seg>
<seg id="385">The haemoglobin target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl (6.2 - 7,5 mmol / l), except for pediatric patients, where the hemoglobin concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="386">Symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age, gender and overall disease burden; therefore, the evaluation of the individual clinical course and condition of disease by the physician is necessary.</seg>
<seg id="387">An increase in haemoglobin by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients, individual hemoglobin values can be observed over or below the haemoglobin target concentration in a patient.</seg>
<seg id="389">Given this hemoglobin variability, a corresponding dose management should be tried to achieve the haemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the haemoglobin value increases by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or if the persistent hemoglobin value exceeds 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epoetin alfa dose is reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is used in the lowest permitted dosage required for control of anaemia and anemia.</seg>
<seg id="392">The clinical results suggest that patients with initial very low Hb value (&lt; 6g / dl or &lt; 3,75 mmol / l) may require higher maintenance doses than patients with initial anaemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">The clinical results suggest that patients with initial very low Hb value (&lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.25 mmol / l) may require higher maintenance doses than patients with initial anaemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.25 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="394">Starting dose 50 I.U. / kg three times a week using an intravenous application, if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.U. / kg (three times a week) until the desired target value is reached (this should take place in steps of at least 4 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="395">Symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age, gender and overall disease burden; therefore, the physician's assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of disease is necessary.</seg>
<seg id="396">Given this hemoglobin variability, a corresponding dose management should be tried to achieve the haemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="397">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is used in the lowest permitted dosage required for controlling the anaemia.</seg>
<seg id="398">If after 4 weeks of the hemoglobin value increased by at least 1 g / dl (0,62 mmol / l) or the actual number of antibodies to ≥ 40,000 cells / µl compared to the baseline value, the dose of 150 I.U. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.U. / kg once a week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the haemoglobin rise &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0,62 mmol / l) and the reticulocyte figure of &lt; 40.000 cells / µl is increased compared to the baseline value, the dose should be increased to 300 I.U. / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="400">If after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.U. / kg three times a week the haemoglobin value has increased by ≥ 1 g / dl (≥ 0,62 mmol / l) or the number of antibodies to ≥ 40,000 cells / µl, the dose of 300 I.U. / kg should be maintained three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="401">If the haemoglobin value is increased by &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0,62 mmol / l) resp. the number of reticulocytes increased by &lt; 40.000 cells / µl opposite the baseline value, a response to epoetin-alfa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be aborted.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with mild anaemia (haematocrit 33 - 39%), in which the precautionary deposit of ≥ 4 blood-preserved foods is required, Abseamed should receive at a dose of 600 I.U. / kg body weight twice weekly for 3 weeks before surgical procedure.</seg>
<seg id="403">Iron substitution should be started as early as possible - e.g. a few weeks before the start of the autologous blood donation program, so that large iron reserves are available before the beginning of the tamed therapy.</seg>
<seg id="404">6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.U. / kg of epoetin alfa which should be given once a week over three weeks (day 21, 14 and 7) before surgery and on the day of surgery (day 0).</seg>
<seg id="405">Epoetin alfa should be preoperatively 300 I.U. / kg of 10 consecutive days, on the day of surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="406">Alternatively, the injection can be given at the end of dialysis through the hose of a fistula needle, followed by 10 ml of isotonic salt solution to rinse the hose and ensure adequate injection of the drug in the circulation.</seg>
<seg id="407">Patients who suffer from the treatment with some erythroblastoenie (Pure Red Cell Aplasia, PRCA) should not receive a abystreamed or another erythroposterenie (see section 4.4 - erythroblastoenia).</seg>
<seg id="408">Heart attack or stroke within one month before the treatment, unstable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep venous thrombosis (e.g. anamnestically known venous thromboembolia).</seg>
<seg id="409">The application of epoetin alfa is contraindicated in patients who are not able to participate in an autologous blood donation program: severe coronary artery disease, peripheral arterial occlusion, vascular disease of the carditis or cerebrovascular disorder; in patients with recently occurred heart attack or cerebrovascular event.</seg>
<seg id="410">Erythroblastoenie (PRCA) Very rare was reported about the occurrence of an antibody-mediated PRCA after months to long treatment with subcutaneous erythropoetin.</seg>
<seg id="411">In patients with sudden loss of activity, the reduction of haemoglobin values (1 - 2 g / dl per month) with increased need of transfusions should be determined and the usual causes for a non-contact (iron, folic acid or vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminium poisoning, infections or inflammations, blood loss and hemolysis) are examined.</seg>
<seg id="412">If the reticulocyte value, taking into account anaemia (i.e. the Reticocytes "Index"), is reduced (&lt; 20.000 / mm3 or &lt; 0,5%), the thrombocytes and leukocytes are normal, and if no other cause of a loss is found, the anti-erythropoetin-antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone marrow for diagnosis of a PRCA should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="413">Data on immunogenicity in subcutaneous usage of Abseamed in patients with a risk for an antibody induced PRCA (patients with renal anaemia) are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="414">8 In patients with chronic renal insufficiency, the upper limit of haemoglobin target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="415">In clinical trials, increased mortality risk and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed when erythropoesis-stimulating agents (ESA) were given with a haemoglobin target concentration of more than 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="416">Controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit attributable to the administration of epoeines, if the haemoglobin concentration is increased by the concentration required to control the symptoms of anemia and the prevention of blood transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="417">The haemoglobin increase should be about 1 g / dl (0,62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month to minimise the risk of increasing blood pressure.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency and clinically evident coronary heart disease or congestion insufficiency, maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of haemoglobin target concentration in maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="419">According to the time available, the treatment of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adults with renal insufficiency, which are not dialysis, does not accelerate the progression of renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="420">In the case of tumour patients under chemotherapy, a 2-3-week delay between epoetin-alfa-fetal and erythropoetin-response should be considered (patients that may need to be transliterated).</seg>
<seg id="421">If the Hb increase is exceeded than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or a hb value of 13 g / dl (8,1 mmol / l), the dose must be adjusted according to section 4.2 to minimise the risk of possible thrombotic events (see section 4.2 treatment of patients with chemotherapy-related anemia - dosage adjustment with the aim of keeping the haemoglobin value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision to apply recombinant erythropoetine should be based on a benefit-risk weighing involving the involvement of the respective patient, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">In patients who are intended for a larger elective orthopaedic surgery, if possible, prior to the beginning of epoetin-alfa therapy the cause of anaemia should be examined and treated accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="424">Patients undergoing major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive appropriate thrombosis prophylaxis, as they have an increased risk of thrombotic and vascular diseases, especially in case of underlying cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="425">In addition, it cannot be ruled out that in the treatment with epoetin alfa for patients with an initial hemoglobin value of &gt; 13 g / dl, an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic / vascular events can exist.</seg>
<seg id="426">In several controlled trials, it was not proven for epoetics to improve overall survival in tumor patients with symptomatic anaemia or reduce the risk of tumour progression.</seg>
<seg id="427">4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy was returned if haemoglobin target concentration was aspired from 12 - 14 g / dl (7.5 - 8.4 mmol / l)</seg>
<seg id="428">If epoetin alfa is used together with Ciclosporin, the blood levels of Ciclosporin should be controlled and the Ciclosporindose should be adapted to the rising haematocrit.</seg>
<seg id="429">In vitro studies on tumor tissues, there are no indications of interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF in relation to hematological differentiation or proliferation.</seg>
<seg id="430">Thrombotic, vascular events such as myocardial ischaemia, myocardial ischemia, cerebral thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, arterial thrombosis and 11 blood clots.</seg>
<seg id="431">The most frequent side-effect during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or the deterioration of an existing hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="432">Increased incidence of thrombovascular events (see Section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General) was observed in patients under treatment with erythropoetins.</seg>
<seg id="433">Regardless of erythropoetin treatment, surgical patients with cardiovascular disease can lead to thrombotic and vascular complications after repeated blood donations.</seg>
<seg id="434">The genetically determined epoetin alfa is glycosilized and is identical with the endogenous human erythropoetin, which was isolated from the urine of anaemia patients.</seg>
<seg id="435">It could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone marrow cells that epoetin alfa specifically stimulates erythropoesis and does not affect leukopoesis.</seg>
<seg id="436">389 patients with haemblastoses (221 multiple myelomes, 144 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and 24 other haemblastoses) and 332 patients with solid tumours (172 breast cancer tumors, 23 lung cancer, 22 gastrointestinal carcinomas, 21 gastrointestinal carcinomas and 30 more).</seg>

<seg id="438">Survival and progression of tumour were examined in five major controlled trials involving 2833 patients; four of these studies were double-blind placebo-controlled trials.</seg>
<seg id="439">In the open study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with recombinant human erythropoetin and the control patients.</seg>
<seg id="440">In these studies, patients with anaemia associated with recombinant human erythropoetin found a more consistent, statistically significant higher mortality than in the controls.</seg>
<seg id="441">Overall survival in studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thrombosis and related complications in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoetin and in checks satisfactory.</seg>
<seg id="442">There is an increased risk of thromboembolic events in tumour patients treated with recombinant human erythropoetin and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="443">It is not clear how far these results are applied to the application of recombinant human erythropoetin in tumor patients who are treated with chemotherapy with the aim of achieving a haemoglobin value below 13 g / dl since too few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data.</seg>
<seg id="444">Epoetin-alfa determinations after repeated intravenous application showed a half-life of about 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a somewhat extended half-life of approximately 5 hours in patients with renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="445">After subcutaneous injection, the serum levels of epoetin alfa are much lower than the serum levels obtained after an intravenous injection.</seg>
<seg id="446">There is no accumulation: the serum levels remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first dose or 24 hours after the last gift.</seg>
<seg id="447">Bone marrow fibrosis is a well-known complication of chronic renal insufficiency in humans and could be attributed to secondary hyperparathyreoidism or unknown factors.</seg>
<seg id="448">In a study of hematalysis patients treated three years with epoetin alfa, the incidence of bone marrow fibrosis was not increased compared to the control group with dialysis patients who were not treated with epoetin alfa.</seg>

<seg id="543">A 2-3-week delay between epoetin-alfa administration and the desired effect should be considered for assessing the efficacy of Abyamed.</seg>
<seg id="544">200 Your doctor will regularly determine your levels of the red blood-dye (haemoglobin) and adjust your Abseamed dose accordingly to minimize the risk of thrombosis (thrombotic event).</seg>
<seg id="545">This risk should be weighed very carefully against the benefits derived from the treatment with epoetin alfa, especially if you are obese (obese) or if thrombotic vascular events have occurred in the past (e.g. deep venous thrombosis or pneumembolism).</seg>
<seg id="546">In case you are cancer patient, remember that Abyamed is like a growth factor for blood cells, and under certain circumstances can affect the tumour in a negative way.</seg>

<seg id="552">Depending on how your blood arm (anemia) refers to the treatment, the dose can be adapted approximately every four weeks until your condition is under control.</seg>
<seg id="553">If necessary, your doctor will arrange regular blood tests to check the treatment success and ensure that the medicine works properly and your haemoglobin value does not exceed a certain value.</seg>
<seg id="554">As soon as you are well set, regular doses of Abseamed between 25 and 50 I.U. / kg are given twice weekly, spread on two equally large injections.</seg>

<seg id="567">Acupa is used to treat the following diseases: osteoporosis (a disease that makes the bones brittle) both in women after menopause and in men.</seg>
<seg id="568">It is used in patients with a high fracture risk (fractures), including patients who have recently suffered a short-traumatic hip fracture as in Hinfections; • Morbus Paget of the bone, a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth.</seg>
<seg id="569">In addition, patients with adult morbus Paget should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment; prior to the first infusion, patients with hip fracture should receive a large dose of vitamin D (50 000 to 125 000 IE) orally or by injection into a muscle.</seg>
<seg id="570">The administration of paracetamol or ibuprofen (remedy against inflammation) shortly after the application of Accredited can reduce the symptoms appearing in the three days following the infusion, such as fever, muscle pain, flu-like symptoms, joint pain and headache.</seg>
<seg id="571">For the treatment of the Morbus Paget, Accredited may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease.</seg>
<seg id="572">As the active ingredient in Acupa is the same as in Zometa, a part of the data material for Zometa was used to evaluate Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="573">In the first study nearly 8 000 elderly women were involved with osteoporosis, and the number of spine and hip fractures was investigated over a period of three years.</seg>
<seg id="574">The second study included 2 127 men and women with osteoporosis over 50 years who recently suffered a hip fracture; the number of fractures was investigated over a period of up to five years.</seg>
<seg id="575">In the case of Morbus Paget, Aclasta was tested in two studies to a total of 357 patients and compared with Risedronat (another bisphosphonate) for six months.</seg>
<seg id="576">The main indicator of the efficacy was whether the content of alkaline phosphatase in serum (an enzyme that breaks bone substance) normalized in the blood or decreased by at least 75% compared to baseline.</seg>
<seg id="577">In the study with older women, the risk of spinal fractures in patients under Aclasta (without other osteoporosis treatment) was reduced by 70% over a period of three years compared to those under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="578">In comparison with all patients under Aclasta (with or without other osteoporosis treatment) with those under placebo the risk of hip fractures was reduced by 41%.</seg>
<seg id="579">In the study involving men and women with hip fracture 9% of the patients under Aclasta had a fracture (92 of 1 065) compared to 13% of those under placebo (139 of 1 062).</seg>
<seg id="580">Most of the Alasta side effects occur within the first three days of infusion and are less frequent with repeated infusions.</seg>
<seg id="581">Aclasta may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to oledronic acid or other bisphosphonate or any other ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="582">As with all bisphosphonates, patients with acroba are subject to the risk of kidney problems, reactions to infusion and osteodeficiency (death of bone tissue) in the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="583">Aclasta manufactures information for physicians who prescribe Accredited for the treatment of osteoporosis, which explains how to use the medicine, as well as similar material for patients in which the side effects of the medicine are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor.</seg>

<seg id="589">For the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis and osteoporosis in men, intravenous infusion of 5 mg aclasta is recommended once a year.</seg>
<seg id="590">In patients with a low-traumatic hip fracture the administration of Aclasta infusion is recommended two or more weeks after the operative care of the hip fracture (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="591">For the treatment of the Morbus Paget, Accredited should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Morbus Paget.</seg>
<seg id="592">After a treatment of the disease with Aclasta, a long period of remission was observed in patients who responded to the therapy (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="593">In addition, it is advisable to ensure an adequate intake of calcium in patients with Morbus Paget for at least 500 mg of elementary calcium per day for at least 10 days after the administration of Aclasta (see paragraph 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="594">In patients with a low-traumatic hip fracture, an initial dose of 50,000 to 125,000 I.U. of oral or intramuscular vitamin D is recommended before the first Aclasta infusion.</seg>
<seg id="595">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of Aclasta may be reduced by adding paracetamol or ibuprofen just after the application of Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="596">Patients with kidney function disorder (see Section 4.4) In patients with a Kreatinin Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min, Aclasta is not recommended as limited clinical experience is available for this patient group.</seg>
<seg id="597">Older patients (≥ 65 years) A dosage adjustment is not necessary because the bioavailability, distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="598">Children and adolescents Activia are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age, as data on safety and effectiveness are missing.</seg>
<seg id="599">Aclasta is not recommended in patients with severe renal insufficiency (Kreatinin-Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min), since only limited clinical experience exists for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="600">Pre-existing hypokalemia must be treated with sufficient intake of calcium and vitamin D before starting the therapy with Aclasta (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="601">Because of the rapid settling of the effect of zoledronylic acid on bone structure, a temporary, sometimes symptomatic hypokalemia may develop, whose maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days after the infusion of aclasa (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="602">In addition, it is advisable to ensure an adequate intake of calcium in patients with Morbus Paget for at least 500 mg of elementary calcium per day for at least 10 days after the administration of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="603">Cancer, chemotherapy, treatment with corticosteroids, poor oral hygiene, should be examined before applying bisphosphonates with appropriate preventive dental treatment.</seg>
<seg id="604">No data is available to patients who need dental interventions, whether the interruption of treatment with bisphosphonates reduces the risk of osteoporosis in the jaws.</seg>
<seg id="605">Clinical evaluation by the treating physician should be the basis for each patient's treatment plan and based on an individual benefit / risk assessment.</seg>

<seg id="610">Renal function disorder cioledronic acid was associated with kidney function disorders that expressed itself as a decrease in kidney function (i.e. an increase of serum carcininin) and in rare cases as acute renal failure.</seg>
<seg id="611">The change in Kreatinin Clearance (measured annually before administration) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as limited renal function were compared with osteoporosis over three years compared to the placebo and placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="612">A temporary increase in serum guinea flaw within 10 days after administration was observed at 1.8% of patients treated with placebo over 0.8% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="613">Based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings, the temporary asymptomatic calcium values, which were below the normal fluctuation range (less than 2.10 mmol / l), showed up to 21% of the patients treated with Aclasta in a large clinical study compared to 21% of the patients treated with Aclasta in the Morbus Paget trials.</seg>
<seg id="614">All patients received supplementary sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the postmenopausal osteoporosis study, in the study to prevent postmenopausal osteoporosis, in the study to avoid fractures after a hip fracture and in the disease-Paget studies (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="615">In the study on preventing clinical fractures after a recent hip fracture, the vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to the administration of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="616">Local reactions after the administration of zoledronylic acid in a large clinical study was reported on local reactions to the infusion site, such as redness, swelling and / or pain (0.7%).</seg>
<seg id="617">Osteoecrosis in the orthodontic area was used, especially in cancer patients, about osteoeirosis (primarily in the jaw area), which were treated with bisphosphonates, including zoledronic acid.</seg>
<seg id="618">Many of these patients had signs of local infections including osteomyelitis, and most of the reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental interventions.</seg>
<seg id="619">Seven patients with 7.736 patients showed an orthonekrose in the jaw area in one with Aclasta and in a placebo treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="620">In case of overdose which leads to clinically relevant hypokalemia, a compensation of calcium and / or intravenous infusion of calcium gluconate can be equated.</seg>
<seg id="621">Clinical effectiveness in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PFT) The effectiveness and safety of acetylation 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was indicated in post-menopausal women (7.736 females aged 65 and 89 years) with either a bone density correction (BMD) or a BMD-T score for the femoral neck ≤ -2.5 with or without signs of an existing vertebral fracture.</seg>
<seg id="622">Effects on morphometric spine fractures Aclasta decreased significantly over a period of three years as well as the frequency of one or more new vertebral fractures after one year (see Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="623">Aclasta-treated patients aged 75 years and older had a 60% reduced risk of vertebral fractures compared to placebo patients (p &lt; 0.0001).</seg>
<seg id="624">Effects on acetylation fractures showed an equally lasting effect over three years, resulting in a reduced risk of hip fractures in a 41% (95% CI, 17% to 58%).</seg>
<seg id="625">Effect on bone density (BMD) Aclasta significantly increased bone density in lumbar spine, hip and distal radius compared to placebo treatment at all times (6, 12, 24 and 36 months).</seg>
<seg id="626">9 Increase of the bone density of the lumbar spine by 6.7%, the total hip by 6.0%, the femoral neck around 5.1% and the distal radius by 3.2%.</seg>
<seg id="627">Bone histology In 152 postmenopausal osteoporotic patients treated with acropa (N = 82) or placebo (N = 70), bone biopsies from the pelvic crest were taken one year after the third annual dose of bone biopsies.</seg>
<seg id="628">In Aclasta, a microcomputer tomographic (µCT) analysis showed an increase in the trabeculous bone volume compared to placebo and the receipt of the trabeculous bone architecture.</seg>
<seg id="629">Bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), the N-terminale propeptide of type I- collagen (P1NP) in serum and the beta-C telopeptid (b-CTx) in serum were determined in sub-groups of 517 to 1,246 patients in periodic intervals during the duration of the study.</seg>
<seg id="630">The treatment with an annual 5 mg dose aclasta reduced BSAP significantly by 30% after 12 months compared to baseline and was held at 28% below the baseline value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="631">P1NP was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52% below the baseline value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="632">B-CTx was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 55% below the baseline value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="633">Vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received a starting dose of vitamin D (50,000 to 125,000 I.U. of orally or intramuscular) 2 weeks before infusion.</seg>
<seg id="634">Total mortality was 10% (101 patients) in the group treated with Aclasta compared to 13% (141 patients) in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="635">Effects on bone mineral density (BMD) In the HORIZON RFT study, the Acupa treatment increased the BMD compared to placebo treatment at all time points.</seg>
<seg id="636">Acupa treatment led to an increase in BMD by 5.4% over 24 months compared to placebo treatment and 4.3% on the neck neck.</seg>
<seg id="637">Clinical effectiveness in men In HORIZON RFT study 508 men were randomized and in 185 patients the BMD was assessed after 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="638">The study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical fractures in men; the frequency of clinical fractures was 7.5% in Aclasta-treated men compared to 8.7% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="639">In another study in males (Study CZOL446M2308) the once annual administration of Aclasta was not inferior to the once weekly administration of alendronate related to the percentage change in the lumbar vertebrae BMD after 24 months compared to the baseline value.</seg>
<seg id="640">Clinical effectiveness of the treatment at Morbus Paget of the bone Aclasta was examined in patients aged over 30 years with radiologically confirmed, especially light to moderately heavy morbus paste of the bone (mean serum levels of alkaline phosphatase in accordance with 2.6x to 3.0 times higher than normal value when inclusion in the study).</seg>
<seg id="641">11 The effectiveness of an infusion of 5 mg of zoledronic acid in comparison to the intake of 30 mg of risedronate once daily during 2 months was demonstrated in two six months comparison studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">In the combined results, a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain influence was observed after 6 months compared to the baseline value for Aclasta and Risedronat.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients who were classified as Responder at the end of the six-month main study (responded to the therapy) could be included in an observation phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">From 143 with Aclasta and 107 patients treated with risedronate, the therapeutic response to 141 of the patients treated with Aclasta, compared with 71 of the patients treated with Risedronate, could be maintained at an average duration of the observation period of 18 months after application.</seg>
<seg id="645">Infusion of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg of coledron acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmacokinetic data, which proved to be a dose-independent.</seg>
<seg id="646">Then the plasma gas rose rapidly to &lt; 10% of the top value after 4 h and &lt; 1% after 24 h followed by a long phase very low concentration, no more than 0.1% of the maximum value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Rapid biphasic disappearance from the large cycle with half-life t ½ α to 0,24 and t ½ β 1.87 hours, followed by a long period of exclusion with a terminal elimination period t ½ g 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early stages of distribution (α and β, with the above 3 ½ values) presumably represent rapid resorption in the bones and excretion over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 hours 39 ± 16% of the administered dose can be found in the urine while the rest is mainly bonded to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The total body-Clearance is 5.04 ± 2.5 l / h independently of the dose and remains unaffected by gender, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion period from 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease of the tin-acid concentration by 30% at the end of the infusion, but had no effect on the surface under the curve (plasma concentration at time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A reduced clearance of the metabolized by cytochrom-P450-enzyme systems is unlikely, because zoledronic acid is not metabolized in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or irreversible, substance-dependent inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient groups (see section 4.2) The renal Clearance of zoledronic acid correlated with the Kreatinin Clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of the Kreatinin Clearance, and was 84 ± 29 ml / min in the 64 examined patients (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">This results in an easy (clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and a regular renal function disorder right down to a creatinin-Clearance up to 35 ml / min no can adjustment of the coledronic acid required.</seg>
<seg id="655">As for severe kidney function disorder (Kreatinin Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min) only limited data is available, no statements are possible for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest non-lethal intravenous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight in mice and rats 0,6 mg / kg body weight.</seg>
<seg id="657">In the case of studies on dogs, single doses of 1.0 mg / kg (based on the AUC, threefold the recommended human-therapeutic exposure) were administered over a period of 15 minutes, well and without a renal influence.</seg>
<seg id="658">Chronic and chronic toxicity In trials with intravenous application, the renal tolerability of zoledronylic acid was determined in rats by doses of 0.6 mg / kg in 3-day intervals, administered in intervals of 2 - 3 weeks (a cumulative dose that corresponds to the 7times of human-therapeutic exposure to AUC).</seg>
<seg id="659">In long-term studies with repeated use at cumulated expositions, which exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure, toxicological effects appeared in other organs, including the gastrointestinal tract and the liver, as well as at the intravenous injection point.</seg>
<seg id="660">The most common findings in repeated use was an increased primary Spongiosa in the metaphysis of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all doses, an infection which reflects the pharmacological, anti-absorptive action of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="661">Rats observed a teratogenicity in doses from 0.2 mg / kg as external and internal (visceral) abnormalities and such a skeleton.</seg>
<seg id="662">No teratogenic effects or embryo-fetal effects were observed on rabbits, although the maternal toxicity of 0.1 mg / kg was pronounced as a result of a low serum-calcium level.</seg>

<seg id="749">Summary of the EPP for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Safety Report (EPP), which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has evaluated the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be used alone (monotherapy) in patients (in particular overweight patients) in which metformin (a diabetes drug) is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="751">It can be used in addition to metformin in patients (in particular overweight patients) that cannot be satisfactory with metformin alone in the highest tolerated dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with sulfonyl resinous or insulin, the previous dose of sulphonyl resinous or insulin may be maintained with the beginning of the treatment, except in patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); this should reduce the dose of sulphonyl alcohol or insulin.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases, whereby type 2 diabetes can be better adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of Actos in tripletherapy was investigated; in addition, the patients received a combination of metformin with a sulphonyl resinous, in addition they were either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylated hemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured, indicating how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos has led to a reduction in HbA1c value, which causes blood sugar levels to be reduced in doses of 15 mg, 30 mg, and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the tripletherapy study, the effect of the additional administration of Actos for existing treatment with metformin and sulfonyl resins showed a decrease in HbA1c values by 0.94%, while the additional dose of placebo led to a decrease of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study where the combination of Actos and insulin was examined in 289 patients, patients who took Actos in addition to insulin reported a decrease in HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months, compared with 0.14% in patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common side effects associated with Actos were visual disturbances, upper respiratory tract infections (colds), weight gain and hypothesis (reduced sensitivity to stimuli).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive to pioglitazone or any of the other ingredients, nor in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high ketone level - acid levels - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It was decided that Actos should serve as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin in patients with metformin, as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission granted the company Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited to approve the placing of Actos in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">"" "the tablets are white to whitish, round, curved and carry on one side the mark" "" "15" "" "and on the other side the inscription" "" "Actos" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin and is unsuitable for metformin due to contraindications or intolerance (see paragraph 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">There are no data available for the use of pioglitazone in patients under 18 years of age, so the application is not recommended in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients who are at risk of developing at least one risk factor (e.g. past cardiac infarction or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or oedema, especially those with reduced cardiac reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain, and oedema when pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">Cardiovascular atcome study with pioglitazone in patients under the age of 75 with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced makrovascular illness was performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">This study showed an increase in heart failure reports, but this did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased initial liver enzymes (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range) or with other signs of liver disease, pioglitazone may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT mirror is increased to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range, the liver enzymes are to be checked again as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient develops symptoms which indicate a hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, loss of appetite and / or dark urine, the liver enzymes are to be checked.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision, whether the treatment of the patient with pioglitazone continues, should be presided by clinical appraisal until the laboratory parameters are found.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical studies with pioglitazone a dose-dependent weight gain has been demonstrated, which can be stirred by fatty deposits and is associated with fluid retention in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="776">A slight reduction of mean haemoglobin values (relative reduction by 4%) and haematocrits (relative reduction by 4.1%) occurred as a result of hemodilution.</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative controlled studies with pioglitazone in patients under metformin (relative reduction of haemoglobin by 3-4% and haematocrits by 3.6-4.1%) and to a lesser extent in patients suffering from sulfonyl resin and insulin (relative reduction in haemoglobin by 1-2% and haematocrits by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin sensitivity, patients who receive pioglitazone as oral or triple-combination therapy with a sulfonyotropic or as two-layer combination therapy with insulin receive the risk of dose-dependent hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the market launch, a reduction in visual acuity was reported in thiazoldindia, including pioglitazone, a occurrence or worsening of diabetic macular edema.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pioglitazone and the occurrence of macular edema, but condonating physicians should be aware of the possibility of a macular edema if patients report about disorders of visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmological examination should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of adverse events related to fractures from randomised controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazone</seg>
<seg id="782">Calculated fractures totaled 1,9 fractures per 100 patient years at the women treated with pioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the ProActive study, a study of over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures of 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) of patients treated with pioglitazone were compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy, and if a patient desires a pregnancy or this happens, the treatment is to be stopped (see Section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies on the interactions have shown that pioglitazone does not have any relevant effects on pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with medicines that are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptives, cyclosporine, calcium channel blockers and HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous use of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8- inhibitor) resulted in an increase in the AUC of pioglitazone by 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous use of pioglitazone with rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a reduction in the AUC of Pioglitazone by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the fact that the treatment with pioglitazone reduces the fetal insulin resistance and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal by reducing the availability of the metabolic substrates for fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; frequently &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; rare &gt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, individual cases: unknown (not estimable from this data).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change in the turgor and the index index of the lens, as observed in other hypoglycemic agents.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical trials with pioglitazone ALT ascents beyond the triples of the upper limit of the normal range were often found as under placebo, however more rarely than in comparison groups under metformin or sulfonyl resin.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an outcome study in patients with advanced makrovascular disease, the incidence of severe congestive heart failure under pioglitazone was 1.6% higher than placebo, if pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch, insufficiency was rarely reported under pioglitazone, but more often when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summarizing analysis of adverse events in bone fractures from randomised controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients in the groups treated with Pioglitazone and over 7,400 patients in the treated groups treated with comparative media.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the ProActive study conducted over a period of 3.5 years, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with pioglitazone, compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients treated with a comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="797">If the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day lasted for four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days no symptoms appeared.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazone appears to function by activating specific core receptors (Peroxisome Proliferation activated Receptor-γ (PPAR-γ)), which leads to an increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells in the animal model.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be demonstrated that Pioglitazon reduces the production of glucosamine in the liver and increases the peripheral glucoseversion in the event of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with Pioglitazon versus Gliclazid as monotherapy was carried out over two years to investigate time until after the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 months of treatment).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time of two years after the beginning of the therapy a blood glucose control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) could be maintained by pioglitazone in 69% of the treated patients (compared to 50% of the patients under Gliclazid).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo controlled trial for over 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was insufficient with insulin despite three months of optimization, were randomized to Pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under pioglitazone the mean HbA1c was reduced by 0.45% compared to those who continue to receive insulin; a reduction in insulin dosage in the group treated with Pioglitazone was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over a year, a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / Kreatinin ratio was statistically significant compared to baseline values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of pioglitazone (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was examined in a small study of type 2 diabetes patients on 18 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials compared to placebo, a reduction in total plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids and an increase in HDL- cholesterol levels as well as slight but clinically not significantly elevated LDL cholesterol levels have been observed.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical studies over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazone reduced the total plasmatylglycerides and free fatty acids in comparison to placebo, metformin or gliclazid and increased the HDL Cholesterinspiegel.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to placebo, no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol was detected in Pioglitazone, whereas lower levels of metformin and Gliclazid were observed.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazon reduced not only the triglyceride level, but also improved the post-prandial elevated triglyceride level, both on the triglyceride concentrations and the hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the ProActive study, a cardiovascular outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced pharmacological disease were randomized to receive either Pioglitazone or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral use pioglitazone is absorbed quickly, with the peak concentrations of unaltered pioglitazone in plasma usually 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">This is based on the contribution of M-IV to the effectiveness of about three times the effectiveness of pioglitazone whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies it has been proven that pioglitazone does not have any relevant effect on pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">Simultaneous use of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inhibitor) or with rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) increases respectively lowers the plasma concentration of pioglitazone (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After oral use of radioactively marked pioglitazone in humans, the constraint was found mainly in the waste (55%) and to a lesser extent in the urine (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The mean plasma elimination round of unaltered pioglitazone is 5-6 hours in humans, and all active metabolites are 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">Plasma concentrations of pioglitazone and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects, but the rates of oral Clearance resemble the mother substance.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies occurred in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys in accordance with repeated administration plasma volume enlargement with hemodilution, anemia and reversible eccentric heart hypertrophy.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the fact that the treatment with pioglitazone reduces the fetal insulin resistance and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal by reducing the availability of the metabolic substrates for fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years) increased incidence of hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumours (in male rats) of the urinary bladder was induced.</seg>
<seg id="821">In an animal model of the family adenomatous polyposis (FAP), the treatment with two other thiazolidindies led to an increased frequency of colontumours.</seg>

<seg id="824">In the ProActive study, a study of over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures of 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) of patients treated with pioglitazone were compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study over two years the effects of combination therapy of metformin were examined with pioglitazone or gliclazid.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical trials over 1 year, a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / Kreatinin ratio was statistically significant compared to baseline values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study of 20 weeks Pioglitazon reduced not only the Nüchtern triglycerides, but also improved the post-prandial elevated triglyceride level, this has an effect on the triglyceride absorption as well as the hepatic Tryglizerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study lacked the goal of its primary endpoint, which constituted a combination of total mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, leg amputation above the ankle, coronary revascularization and revising of the leg arteries, suggests that the intake of pioglitazone does not involve cardiovascular long-term risks.</seg>

<seg id="865">In the study, the concentration of a substance (glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was measured after 12 weeks, indicating how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="866">Actrophane led to a decrease in the HbA1c mirror, suggesting that the blood sugar level was similarly severe as with another human insulin analog.</seg>
<seg id="867">Actraphane should not be used in patients who may be susceptible to hypersensitive (allergic) to human insulin (rDNA) or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="868">In addition, the doses of actraphane may be adapted when administered together with a number of other medicines which may affect blood sugar (the complete list is to be found in the package insert).</seg>
<seg id="869">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Actraphane overlap the risks in the treatment of diabetes.</seg>

<seg id="1193">Colchicin / Indometacin / hydrochlorothiazide / Warfarin Febuxfocus can be used together with Colchicin or Indometacin, without the need for a dosage adjustment for febuxstate or the other active ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="1194">In a study with subjects, 120 mg of ADENURIC 1 x daily showed an average 22% increase in the AUC of Desipramine, a CYP2D6 medium, indicating a possible weak inhibitor effect of Febuxstat on the CYP2D6 enzyme in vivo.</seg>
<seg id="1195">Tazida It could be shown that the simultaneous consumption of an antacid which contains magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide, delays the absorption of febuxstat (about 1 hour) and reduces the CMAX by 32%, but does not cause any significant change in the AUC.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Pregnancy data over a very limited number of exposed pregnancies can not be limited to side effects of Febuxstat on pregnancy or the health of the fetus / newborn.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Animal experimental studies do not include direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development or birth (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="1198">Patients should be careful when controlling a vehicle, operating machines or in the exercise of hazardous activities until they can reasonably be certain that ADENURIC does not adversely affect their performance.</seg>
<seg id="1199">A numerically higher incidence of the results reported by the investigator was observed in the overall febuxostatectgroup in Phase 3 (1,3 versus 0.3 events per 100 patient years) and in long-term extension studies (1.4 versus 0.7 events per 100 patient years) although no statistical significant differences were found and no causal relationship with Febuxstat could be detected.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The risk factors determined in these patients were arteriosclerosis and / or myocardial infarction or abnormal heart failure in the medical history.</seg>
<seg id="1201">Frequent (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10), occasional (≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000) and rare (≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000) side effects that could be associated with the medicine and which were reported more than once in all Febuxstat treatment groups, are listed below.</seg>
<seg id="1202">Diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting are more common in patients who are treated with colchicine at the same time. * * In clinical trials no serious rashes or severe hypersensitivity reactions have been observed.</seg>
<seg id="1203">7 Open long-term extension studies In the open long-term extension studies 906 patients up to 1 year were treated, 322 patients up to 2 years, 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients up to 4 years treated with Febuxstat 80 mg / 120 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1204">The events related to long-term extension studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies (see Table 1).</seg>
<seg id="1205">The following treatment-related events were reported in all Febuxostat- treatment groups altogether more than once and occurred in patients receiving febuxstat 80 mg / 120 mg in long-term extension studies (up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,900 patient-years), according to indications.</seg>
<seg id="1206">The following treatment-related events were either not reported in the pivot studies phase 3 for these doses or with a lower frequency:</seg>

<seg id="1210">Clinical trial results The effectiveness of ADENURIC was shown in two pivot studies of Phase 3 (APEX study and FACT study as described below), which were performed with 1,832 patients with hyperuricaemia and gout.</seg>
<seg id="1211">The primary efficacy endpoint was in every study the proportion of patients in which the last three month-specific serum resection levels &lt; 6,0 mg / dl (357 µmol / l) were.</seg>

<seg id="1216">The reduction in serum resaw rate to &lt; 6,0 mg / dl (357 µmol / l) was observed during the visit to the doctor in week 2 and permanently maintained over the entire treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1217">509 patients received alumlauinol 300 mg 1 x daily; 10 patients with serum incremental values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2,0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Primary endpoint in the subgroup of patients with renal function The APEX study evaluated the efficacy in 40 patients with renal function restriction (i.e. D).</seg>
<seg id="1219">With ADENURIC the primary efficacy endpoint was 44% (80 mg 1 x daily), 45% (120 mg 1 x daily) and 60% (240 mg 1 x daily) of patients.</seg>
<seg id="1220">There were no clinically significant differences in the percentage return of serum resins in subjects, irrespective of kidney function (58% in the group with normal kidney function and 55% in the group with severe kidney function disorders).</seg>
<seg id="1221">Primary endpoint in the subgroup of patients with serum resins concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl Etwa 40% of patients (baseline) had a serum aspiration concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl.</seg>
<seg id="1222">The data from the Phase 3 open extension study showed that the permanent reduction of the serumina acid levels to &lt; 6mg / dl (&lt; 357 µmol / l) showed a decrease in incidence of gout attacks (i.e. more than 97% of patients did not require treatment against a rake).</seg>
<seg id="1223">This was associated with a reduction in the size of the gout node, resulting in 54% of the patients a complete disappearance of the gout nodes up to 24.</seg>
<seg id="1224">Increased TSH values (&gt; 5.5 µIE / ml) were observed in patients receiving long-term treatment with Febuxstat (5.0%) and also in patients receiving Allopurinol (5.8%) in open long-term extension studies (see paragraph 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1225">In healthy volunteers the maximum plasma concentrations (CMAX) and the area below the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) of Febuxstat increased dose-proportional doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dosages.</seg>
<seg id="1226">For doses between 120 mg and 300 mg, an increase in AUC is observed for Febuxstat, which is larger than the dose-proportional rise.</seg>
<seg id="1227">After taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily, the CMAX amounts to about 2.8-3.2 µg / ml and 5.0-5.3 µg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1228">However, no clinically significant change was observed in the percentage decline in serum residnacial concentration, provided that this was tested (multiple doses of 80 mg).</seg>
<seg id="1229">Distribution The seeming steady state distribution volume (Vss / F) from Febuxstat lies in the range from 29 to 75 l after intake of doses of 10-300 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1230">The plasma release of Febuxstat amounts to around 99.2% (primary binding to albumin) and is consistent across the concentration width achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1231">In vitro studies in human liver microsoms showed that these oxidative metabolites are mainly formed by CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2C8 or CYP2C9, and that Febuxostatglucuronid is mainly produced by UGT 1A1, 1A8 and 1A9.</seg>
<seg id="1232">After taking a 80 mg dose of 14C-marked Febuxstat, about 49% of the dose found in urine as unmodified Febuxstate (30%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugate (13%) as well as other unknown metabolites (3%).</seg>

<seg id="1239">These findings are seen as a result of specific purine metabolic and urine composition and are considered not relevant for clinical application.</seg>
<seg id="1240">It has been found that in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day, Febuxstat has no effect on fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats.</seg>
<seg id="1241">In high doses, which were about 4 times the human therapeutic exposure, maternal toxicity occurred, which accompanied by a decrease in the breeding performance and a developmental delay in the offspring of rats.</seg>

<seg id="1276">The patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water (no mineral water) at least 30 minutes before eating, drinking or taking other drugs (including antazida, calcium and vitamin supplements).</seg>
<seg id="1277">In order to avoid irritation of the oesophagus, the patient must not lie down until after the first food intake of the day, which should take place 30 minutes after taking the tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1278">As alendronate and vitamin D3 are already being used separately in pharmaceuticals that are approved in the European Union, the Company presented data originating from previous studies and published literature.</seg>
<seg id="1279">The company also conducted a study with 35 men and 682 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis in order to verify the efficacy of ADROVANCE concerning the increase in vitamin D levels.</seg>
<seg id="1280">After a 15-week treatment, the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in patients treated with ADROVANCE was lower (11%) than those who only took alendronate (32%).</seg>
<seg id="1281">The company also submitted data suggesting that the alendronate dose contained in ADROVANCE is exactly the dose required to prevent bone loss.</seg>
<seg id="1282">The most common side effects (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are headaches, pains of the musculoskeletal system (muscles, bones or joints) and symptoms of the digestive system, such as abdominal pain, dyspepsia (diarrhea), flattening, dysphagia (swallowing), trimmed abdomen (bloated abdomen) and acidic pitching.</seg>
<seg id="1283">In patients with hypersensitivity to alendronate, vitamin D3 or any of the other ingredients ADROVANCE cannot be applied.</seg>

<seg id="1288">The following indications are to be observed precisely to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and associated side effects (see paragraph 4.4):</seg>
<seg id="1289">• ADROVANCE should be swallowed once the day with a full glass of water (at least 200 ml). • The patients should not chew the tablet or leave the tablet in the mouth, as there is a risk for oropharyngeal ulcera. • The patients should not lie before the first food intake of the day that should take 30 minutes after taking the tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1290">B. peptic ulceration, active gastrointestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper gastrointestinal tract compared to pyloroplasty, only be given special caution (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1291">Esophageal responses, such as esophagitis, esophageal ulcera and esophageal erosions, rarely followed by esophageal strokes, were reported in patients under the intake of alendronate (partly these were severe and required a hospitalization).</seg>
<seg id="1292">The doctor should therefore draw attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible esophageal reactions, and patients should be advised to suspend the appearance of symptoms of esophageal irritation such as dysphagia, pain in swallowing or resoystal pain or new or worsening heartburn (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1293">3 The risk of severe esophageal side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or continue taking other symptoms after the occurrence of symptoms indicative of esophageal irritation.</seg>
<seg id="1294">It is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1295">Whereas in large-scale clinical studies with alendronat no increased risk was detected, stomach and duodenal ulcera, including some severe and with complications, were reported (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1296">Osteodeficiency of the jaw, commonly associated with tooth extraction and / or local infection (including osteomyelitis), was reported in cancer patients whose therapeutic regimen mainly contain intravenous bisphosphonate.</seg>
<seg id="1297">There are no data available which indicates whether bisphosphonate therapy is reduced in patients who need a slate surgical procedure, reducing the risk of osteoporosis of the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="1298">The clinical evaluation by the treating physician is decisive for the treatment plan in each patient based on an individual benefit-risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Patients should be instructed that when taking a ADROVANCE dose they should take the tablet next morning after having noticed their failure.</seg>
<seg id="1300">You should not take two tablets the same day, but continue taking one tablet per week as originally planned on the day of the week intended for it.</seg>
<seg id="1301">Other diseases affecting the metabolism (such as vitamin D deficiency and hypoparathyreoidism) should also be adequately treated before beginning of therapy with ADROVANCE.</seg>
<seg id="1302">Alendronate foods and beverages (including mineral water), calcium supplements, antacids and some oral medicines can interfere with the resorption of alendronat when taken at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1303">Therefore, after taking alendronate, patients must wait at least 30 minutes before taking other drugs (see Sections 4.2 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1304">Although specific interaction studies were not performed, alendronate was taken in clinical trials together with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines without clinically relevant interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1305">ADROVANCE is only intended for postmenopausal women and is therefore neither used during pregnancy nor lactating women.</seg>
<seg id="1306">Animal studies with alendronate do not indicate directly damaging effects with regard to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal or postnatal development.</seg>

<seg id="1402">Since Tacrolimus and Prograf / Prograft are already used in the EU, the company has presented the results of previously carried out studies with Prograf / Prograft and data from published literature.</seg>
<seg id="1403">In addition, the results of a clinical study were submitted to 668 patients with kidney transplant, with the use of Advagraf with Prograf / Prograft or Ciclosporin.</seg>
<seg id="1404">The main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplant was repelled after a treatment duration of one year (for example, by examining how often a new organ transplant or a resumption of dialysis was required).</seg>
<seg id="1405">In addition, shorter further studies were conducted in 119 patients with kidney transplant and 129 patients with liver transplant and examined how Advagraf is absorbed by the body compared to Prograf / Prograft.</seg>

<seg id="1410">Only physicians who are familiar with immunosuppressive therapy and treatment of transplant patients should prescribe this medicine or make changes in immunosuppressive therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Clinically relevant variations of the systemic exposure of Tacrolimus can lead to graft rejection or increased incidence of adverse events, including immunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage; reformulation of the formulation or the regime should only be performed under close-meshed control of a physician experienced in transplantation (see Sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">As a result of a change to an alternative formulation, a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adaptation must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of Tacrolimus remains intact.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The dosage of Advagraf should be based primarily on clinical assessment of rejection and tolerability in individual cases and on blood-level measurement (see below "Recommendations</seg>
<seg id="1415">After switching from Prograf to Advagraf, the tacrolimus levels should be controlled before the changeover and over two weeks after conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1416">On Day 4, systemic exposure, measured as a level mirror, with both formulations was comparable to both kidney and liver transplanted patients.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated controls of the tacrolimus valley mirror are recommended during the first two weeks of transplantation on Advagraf to ensure proper substance exposure in the immediate post-transplant phase.</seg>
<seg id="1418">Since Tacrolimus is a low clearance substance, an adaptation of the Advagraf can take several days until the Steady State is reached.</seg>

<seg id="1420">Duration of application To suppress the transplant rejection, immunosuppression must be maintained; consequently, a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1421">Dose recommendations - kidney transplant prophylaxis of graft rejection The oral adjuvant therapy should begin at 0.20 - 0.30 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1422">Further dosage adjustment can be required later because the pharmacokinetics of Tacrolimus can change after the transplant in the course of stabilization of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Dose recommendations - liver transplant prophylaxis of transplant rejection Actual Advagraf therapy should start with 0.10 - 0.20 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Dosage recommendation - conversion from Prograf to Advagraf Must a transplant receiver of twice daily dosage of Prograf capsules can be changed to a once daily intake of Advagraf, this conversion has to take place in ratio 1: 1 (mg: mg), relative to the entire daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1425">Renal and liver transplant After switching from other immunosuppressants to Advagraf once a day, the treatment with the oral Initialdose recommended in Kidney and liver transplant should begin for the prevention of graft rejection.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Heart transplant in adult patients who are switched to Advagraf is an oral initial dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day once daily in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1427">Other transplant recipients, although there is no clinical experience with Advagraf in lung, pancreatic and colorectal grafted patients, was used in an oral initial dose of 0.10 - 0.15 mg / kg / day, in a oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and for colon recipients in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Dose adjustment in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function For maintenance of blood serum levels in the targeted area, a reduction of the dose may be required in patients with severe liver dysfunction.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced kidney function Since the renal function does not affect the pharmacokinetics of Tacrolimus, it can be assumed that a dosage adjustment is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1430">Due to the nephrotoxic potential of Tacrolimus, however, a careful monitoring of the renal function (including regular determination of the serum cholesterol level, a calculation of the creatine inand a monitoring of the urinary volume) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Conversion from Ciclosporin to Advagraf When switching from a Ciclosporin to a Tacrolimus-based therapy caution is advised (see Sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">Recommendations for the blood level in full blood The dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rejection and tolerability in individual cases using full blood Tacrolimus talkback controls.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended to perform frequent checks of tacrolimus levels during the first two weeks after transplant followed by periodic controls during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood-level mirror from Tacrolimus should also be controlled after switch from Prograf to Advagraf, dosage adjustment, changes in immunosuppressive therapy or while applying substances that could change the tacrolimus blood circulation (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since Advagraf is a medicine with a low clearance, adjustments to the dose may take several days until the Steady State has entered.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical trials suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases when the blood level in the blood is not exceeding 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice the blood levels of tacrolimus in the first time after liver transplants are usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and with kidney and heart transplanted patients with 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver, kidney and heart transplant recipients, blood concentrations were generally used in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to serious adverse events including graft rejection or other side effects which may occur as a result of tacrolimus sub- or over-exposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage; reformulation of the formulation or the regime should only be performed under close-meshed control of a physician experienced in transplantation (see Sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 For the treatment of adult patients with graft rejection which proved to be therapy resistant to other immunosuppressants, there are no clinical data for the retarded formulation of Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1442">Clinical data for the retarded formulation of Advagraf is not yet available for prophylaxis of graft rejection in adult heart transplant recipients and graft receivers in pediatric patients.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Due to possible interactions leading to a reduction in the tacrolimus levels in the blood and a weakening of the clinical effect of tacrolimus, taking herbal supplements containing St. John's wort (hypericum perforatum) or other herbal remedies during treatment with Advagraf (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, a particularly careful monitoring of the Tacrolimus- concentrations in the blood is offered, since the Tacrolimus blood levels can be subject to considerable variations in such conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, a corneal or septum-hypertrophie referred to as cardiomyopathy was observed under Prograf, which can therefore also occur under Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease, a treatment with corticosteroids, high blood pressure, kidney or liver function disorders, infections, fluid overload and edema.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosuppressants, exposure to sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of malignant skin lesions due to suitable clothes or use of a sun protective device with a high protection factor.</seg>
<seg id="1448">If patients who are taking Tacrolimus, symptoms of PRES such as headache, altered states of consciousness, convulsions, and vision disturbances should show a radiological examination (e.g.</seg>
<seg id="1449">Since Advagraf contains hard capsules, retarded, lactose, special caution is required in patients with rare hereditary galactose intolerance, lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption.</seg>
<seg id="1450">Simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies, known as inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4, can affect Tacrolimus's metabolism and consequently increase or decrease the blood values of Tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1451">It is therefore recommended to monitor the Tacrolimus blood levels while adding substances that can alter the CYP3A metabolism and adjust the Tacrolimus dose to maintain uniform concentrations (see Sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1452">A strongly distinctive interaction became with antimycotics such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole and Voriconazole as well as with the Macroyelid antibiotic erythromycin and HIV protease inhibitors (z).</seg>
<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetic studies revealed that the increase in blood levels was mainly due to the increased oral bioavailability of Tacrolimus due to the inhibition of gastrointestinal metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1454">Highly dosed prednisolone or methylprednisolone, as used in acute rejection reactions, can increase or decrease the concentration of tacrolimus in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The effect of tacrolimus on the metabolism of other Tacrolimus drugs is known as CYP3A4 inhibition; therefore, the simultaneous application of tacrolimus with medicines that are metabolized by CYP3A4 may affect their metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Since Tacrolimus can reduce the Clearance of steroid contraceptives and therefore increase hormone exposure, decisions on contraceptive measures must be particularly cautious.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal studies have shown that Tacrolimus can potentially lessen the clearance of pentobarbital and phenazon and increase their half-life.</seg>
<seg id="1458">The results of a small number of tests on transplant patients do not indicate that in contrast to other immunosuppressants, there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1459">In utero exposure a monitoring of the newborn is recommended for possible adverse effects of tacrolimus (especially regarding its effect on the kidneys).</seg>
<seg id="1460">There is the risk of premature birth (&lt; week 37) and a hypercalemia of the newborn (incidence 8 of 111 newborns, i.e.:</seg>

<seg id="1466">Cases of BK-Virus-associated nephropathy and JC virus-associated progressive multifocal leukencephalopathy (PML) were reported in patients with immunosuppressive therapy, including therapy with Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1467">Benign or malignant neoplasms including EBV-associated lymphoproliferative diseases and skin tumors were reported in connection with the treatment with Tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Due to its high molecular weight, low water solubility and high binding of erythrocytes and plasma proteins, it can be assumed that Tacrolimus is not dialyable.</seg>
<seg id="1469">The action mechanism and pharmacodynamic effects on the molecular level are likely to mediate the effects of tacrolimus by binding to a cytosolic protein (FKBP12), which is responsible for the enrichment of the connection in the cellular nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="1470">This leads to a calciumdependent inhibition of signal transduction channels in the T cell and thus prevents the transcription of a certain series of lymphocytic genes.</seg>

<seg id="1482">Overall, the safety profile of oral Prograf in these published studies corresponded to observations in the large studies in which Prograf was used for primary immunosuppression in liver, kidney and heart transplant recipients.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Lung transplantation In an interim analysis of a recent, multicentre study with oral Prograf, more than 110 patients were reported, who received either Tacrolimus or Ciclosporin as part of a 1: 1 randomization.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Chronic graft rejection, the obliteration of the bronchiolitis, was less common in the first year after the transplant (2.86% versus 8.57%).</seg>
<seg id="1485">The survival rate after one year was 80.8% in the Tacrolimus- and 83% in the Ciclosporin group (Treede et al., 3rd ICI San Diego, USA, 2004; Abstract 22).</seg>
<seg id="1486">In patients treated with Tacrolimus, it occurred in 21.7% of the cases for the emergence of a bronchiolitis obliterans compared to 38.0% under Ciclosporin (p = 0.025).</seg>
<seg id="1487">The number of cases in which of Ciclosporin had to be changed to tacrolimus (n = 13) was significantly larger (p = 0.02) than the number of patients switched from tacrolimus to ciclosporin (n = 2) (Keenan et al., Ann Thoracic Surg 1995; 60: 580).</seg>
<seg id="1488">The number of cases in which there was no acute rejection of transplants was higher after 6 months (57.7% versus 45.8%) and after 1 year (50% versus 33.3%) for patients of the Tacrolimus group (Treede et al., J Heart Lung transplant 2001; 20: 511).</seg>
<seg id="1489">In one study the incidence of bronchiolitis obliteration was significantly lower in patients treated with Tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1490">A multicentre study with oral Prograf was performed on 205 patients undergoing pancreatic and renal transplantation following a randomised tacrolimus (n = 103) or Ciclosporin (n = 102).</seg>
<seg id="1491">The oral initialdose (per protocol) of Tacrolimus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then reached after reaching the desired level level of 8 to 15 ng / ml per 5.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The published clinical results of a monocentric study with oral Prograf as primary immunosuppressant after colon transplants showed an updated survival rate of 75% after 1 year under Tacrolimus and prednisone, 5% after 5 years and 42% after 10 years.</seg>

<seg id="1494">Factors such as a low hematocrit value and low protein concentrations that lead to an increase in the disconnected fraction of Tacrolimus, or a strengthening of metabolism induced by treatment with corticosteroids, should be responsible for the higher clearance rates observed after transplant.</seg>
<seg id="1495">This causes the tacrolimus to be almost completely metabolized before excretion, whereby the excretion occurs mainly via the bile.</seg>
<seg id="1496">In case of stable patients diagnosed with Prograf (twice daily) on Advagraf (once daily) in relation to the total daily dose, the systemic exposure of Tacrolimus (AUC0-24) under Advagraf was approximately 10% lower than under Prograf.</seg>

<seg id="1530">Advata is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (a congenital blood clotting disorder caused by the lack of factor VIII).</seg>
<seg id="1531">The dosage and frequency of the application depend on whether advocates are used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding in surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with haemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency, which causes blood clots such as bleeding in joints, muscles or inner organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma, but produced by a method called recombinant DNA:</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) has been introduced, which enables them to form the human scent factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advata is similar to another medicine approved in the European Union named Recombinate, but is made differently so that the medicine does not contain proteins of human or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate haemophilia A, including a study with 53 children under six years, the use of the medicine was investigated for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1537">The main study evaluated the efficacy of supplements in the prevention of bleeding in 86% of 510 new blood types with "excellent" or "good."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common side effects of advata (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are dizziness, headache, pyrexia (fever) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Advocate may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the human clotting factor VIII, mouse or hamster protein, or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission granted the company Baxter AG a permit for the placing of lawyers in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage and duration of substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, the location and extent of the bleeding and the patient's clinical condition.</seg>
<seg id="1542">In the case of the following haemorrhagic events, the factor VIII activity in the corresponding period is not reduced to the specified plasmash (in% of the standard or in I.E. / dl).</seg>
<seg id="1543">Injection every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years) for 3-4 days or longer until the pain and acute impairment are eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Repeat the injection every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years) until the risk for the patient is over.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During the treatment course, an appropriate determination of the factor VIII plasma is recommended to control the dose and the frequency of injections.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients may differ in their response to factor VIII, different in vivo recovery and have different half-value times.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 Prophylaxis For long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe hemophilia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.U. of factor VIII per kg body weight within 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor VIII plasma activities are not reached or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose, a test must be carried out in order to verify an inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors, it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective, so that other therapeutic measures have to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The speed of administration should be directed to the patient's condition whereby the maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) against factor VIII is a well-known complication in the treatment of patients with haemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always against the procoagulatory activity of Factor VIII-directed IgG immunoglobulins, which are quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml plasma using modified Bethesda assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of developing inhibitors correlates with the extent of exposure to factor VIII, whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure days is greatest and depends on genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In pretreated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 excuses and anamnestic-known inhibitor development, after conversion from a recombinant factor VIII product to another, the recurrence of (lowest) inhibitors was observed.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Due to the rare occurrence of hemophilia A in women, there are no experiences regarding the application of factor VIII during pregnancy and lactation.</seg>
<seg id="1556">In the largest number of patients, ADRs were inhibitors against factor VIII (5 patients), which showed a higher risk of the formation of inhibitors, headaches (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).</seg>
<seg id="1557">Very common (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10), sometimes (≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000), rarely known (frequency based on available data is not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="1558">A) The percentage of patients was calculated based on the sum of individual patients (234). the unexpected drop in the blood coagulation factor VIII-Spiegels was performed postoperatively (10 - 14 post-operative day) in a patient under continuous ADVATE infusion.</seg>
<seg id="1559">The blood clotting was maintained throughout the time and both the factor VIII- mirror in plasma and the Clearance rate showed sufficient values on the 15th day of the day.</seg>
<seg id="1560">In clinical trials with ADVATE to 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed severe to moderate hematiophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) and previous exposure to factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 150 days), only one patient after 26 exposure days with ADVATE showed a low inhibitor (2.4 B.E. in modified Bethesda-Approach).</seg>
<seg id="1561">In addition, none of the 53 paediatric patients with an age of less than 6 years and diagnosed heavy to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%), after previous exposure to factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 50 days), found a FVIII inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="1562">In previously untreated patients of an ongoing clinical trial, 5 of 25 (20%) with ADVFA were treated with inhibitors against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The patient's immune response to traces of contaminated proteins was analysed by examining the antibody titer against these proteins, laboratory parameters and reported side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1564">A patient showed both a statistically significant uptrend as well as an persistent peak of the antibody level against anti-CHO cell proteins, otherwise there were no signs or symptoms indicative of an allergic reaction or hypersensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="1565">In four patients, the presence of Urtikaria, Pruritus, rash and increased number of eosinophiles granulocytes was reported in several repeated product expositions within the study.</seg>
<seg id="1566">7 As with other intravenous products, allergic reactions of the allergic type were reported in ADVATE, including anaphylactic / anaphylactoider reactions (frequency not known).</seg>
<seg id="1567">The activated factor VIII acts as a factor factor for the activated Factor IX and accelerates the formation of activated factor X by factor X.</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available from the initial approval, the CHMP continues to evaluate the benefit-risk weighing as a positive, but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, the CHMP has decided on the basis of the safety profile of ADVATE, which makes a filing of PSURs every 6 months, decided that the authorisation holder should apply for another extension procedure in 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">December 2008 Gendux Molecular Limited was officially granted the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) that the company has received its application for the approval of Advexin for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Usually, however, the chest, the brain, the bones or the soft tissues (tissue that connects, surrounds and supports other structures in the body) are affected.</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a type of virus genetically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">The virus in Advexin is an "Adenovirus," which has been modified in such a way that it cannot produce copies of itself and thus cannot trigger infections in humans.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advexin would have been injected directly into the tumors and thus enable the cancer cells to form the normal p53 protein again.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53-protein produced from the defective p53 gene in the human body normally contributes to the restoration of damaged DNA and killing cells, if the DNA cannot be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1646">In the case of Li-Fraumeni cancer, in which the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein does not work properly, and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company presented data from a study with a patient where Li-Fraumeni-Krebs stood in the area of the underbelly, the bones and the brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP had checked the company's answers to the questions he asked, there were still some questions unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the review of the submitted documents, the CHMP will generate a list of questions sent to the company on day 120.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to the CHMP, it was not sufficiently proven that the injection of Advexin in Li-Fraumeni tumours brings benefits to patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The Committee also had concerns about the processing of the drug in the body, the type of administration and the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that Advexin can be established in a reliable way and that it is neither harmful to the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company did not inform the CHMP if the withdrawal has consequences for patients currently participating in clinical trials or "compassionate-use" programs with Advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "" "" "altered active ingredients" "" "means that the tablets are composed so that one of the effective components is released immediately and the other is released slowly over a few hours." ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, inflammation of the nasal passages caused by allergy to pollen) in patients with nasal mucous swelling (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and adolescents aged 12 and over, the recommended dose of aerinaze is twice daily a tablet, which is to be taken with or without food entirely with a glass of water.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and be terminated once the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (clogged nose), are cleared.</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medicine can be reduced to the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main effective measures were the changes in the severity of the symptoms of hay fever, which were reported by the patients before the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed using a standard scale, how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">When considering all hay fever symptoms other than obstruction of the nose, the patients who took Aerinaze reported a decrease in symptoms by 46.0%, compared with 35.9% in patients who took pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">When only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was seen, the patients under aerinaze showed a relief of symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in patients who took loss of desloratadin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of aerinaze (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are tachycardia, mouth-dryness, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (restlessness), constipation, headache, fatigue, insomnia (sleeplessness), somnolency (sleepiness), sleep disorders and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to desloratadin, pseudoephedrine or any of the other ingredients, against adrenergic agents or laura adin (another medicine for the treatment of allergies).</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze should also not be used in patients suffering from a congenital glaucoma (elevated intraocular pressure), cardiac or vascular disease including hypertension (hypertension), hyperthyrosis (hyperthyrosis) or hypertension (cerebral stroke) or a risk of hemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe for the transport of Aerinaze throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, but it is swallowed whole (i.e. without breaking it, breaking or chewing).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy (see Section 5.1), Aerinaze should not be used in children under 12 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is to be kept as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms finish.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the use time to 10 days, as long-term use can decrease the activity of pseudoephedrine with time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory tract, the treatment can be continued with either desloratadin as a monotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Because Aerinaze contains pseudoephedrine, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients treated with a mono-oxidase (MAO) inhibitor or within 2 weeks after completion of such a therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to alphamimetic activity in combined application of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstrictors such as bromocripitin, pergoddess, ergotamine, dihydroergotamine or other deongestiva, which can be attributed to peroral or nasal as a wave of Rhinology (phenylpropanolamine, phenymetazoline, Naphazolin, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and efficacy of this combination therapy have not been tested for this patient population and the data is not sufficient to provide appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and efficacy of aerinaze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver function disorders and the data were not sufficient to provide appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed that the treatment must be abused in case of hypertension or tachycardia or palpitations, cardiac arrhythmia, nausea or any other neurological symptoms (such as headache or amplification of headache).</seg>
<seg id="1677">Patients with hypertension • Patients with hypertension • Patients with a myocardial infarction in anamnesis, diabetes mellitus, bladder neck, or bronchospasm in anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze must be disposed of at least 48 hours prior to the performance of dermatological tests as antihistamines otherwise can prevent or reduce positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In the course of clinical trials with desloratadin in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were administered, no clinically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of the loratadin were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The results of the psychomotor test showed no significant differences between those treated with desloratadin and those treated with placebo, regardless of whether the loratadin alone or with alcohol was taken.</seg>
<seg id="1681">Enzyme responsible for the loss of the loratadin has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be excluded completely.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadin does not inhibit in vivo CYP3A4, and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 is not inhibitory and is neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The harmlessness of the use of aerinaze during pregnancy is not assured, experiences from a large number of affected pregnancies, however, do not increase the frequency of abnormalities compared to the frequency of the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproductive studies on animals are not always transmitted to humans and due to the vasoconstrictive properties of pseudoephedrine, aerinaze should not be used during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should be advised that in very rare cases it may lead to a dizziness which may result in impaired mobility or ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1686">Symptoms may vary between CNS depression (sedation, apnea, decreased mental alertness, cyanose, coma, cardiovascular collapse) and CNS stimulation (sleeplessness, hallucinations, tremor, convulsions) with possible lethal routines.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headache, anxiety, weakened Miktion, muscular weakness and increased muscle tension, euphoria, arousal, breath insufficiency, heart rhythm disorders, tachycardia, palpitations, thirst, tinnitus, ataxia, vision disturbances and hypertension or hypotonia.</seg>
<seg id="1688">A CNS stimulation is particularly likely in children, as well as atropine-typical symptoms (mouth-dry, pupil starre and - dilatation, skin redness, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include both the inhibition of release of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 of human mast cells / basophiles and the inhibition of the expression of the adult P-selectin on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In a single dose study with adults, Desloratadin 5 mg has no influence on standard measurements of the flight line including the amplification of subjective sleepiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical trials at the recommended dosage of 5 mg a day there was no increased incidence of drowsiness compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage can cause further sympathetic effects, such as increasing blood pressure, tachycardia or manifestations of CNS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">1,248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years took part in seasonal allergic rhinitis with 414 patients receiving Aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies histamine antagonistic effectiveness of aerinaze tablets, determined by the overall score for the symptoms (except nasal mucosa swelling), was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoephedrine via the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The effectiveness of aerinaze tablets with regard to the swelling effect, determined by the nasal mucosal swelling, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with desloratadin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The effectiveness of aerinaze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender, age or ethnic origin.</seg>
<seg id="1697">In the context of an individual dose study for pharmacokinetics of aerinaze, Desloratadin has been detectable within 30 minutes of administering in the plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the oral application of aerinaze in healthy volunteers for 14 days, the flow equivalent of Desloratadin, 3-hydroxydesloratadin and pseudoephedrine was reached on day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">In the context of a pharmacokinetic multiple dose study carried out as a tablet in healthy adult volunteers, it was found that four volunteers were badly metabolised.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interaction study shows that the exposure (CMAx and AUC) of pseudoephedrine after the sole administration of pseudoephedrine was bioequivalent to the exposure after administration of an Aerinaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on conventional safety harmacology studies, toxicity in repeated doses, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, however, the preclinical data with the loratadin cannot detect any particular dangers for humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity than its individual constituents, and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive toxicity studies the combination of Loratadin / Pseudoephedrine was not teratogenic in the oral administration of rats at a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and in rabbits at a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1704">March 2007 and in Module 1.8.1 of the authorisation application described pharmacovigilance system is established and works before and while the product is on the market.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Antihistamines contribute to alleviating the allergic symptoms by preventing histamine, a body's own substance, its effect.</seg>
<seg id="1706">Aerinaze tablets relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever), such as sneezing, running or itchy nose and watering or itchy eyes with concurrent constipation of the nose.</seg>

<seg id="1709">Tell your doctor if you are experiencing or diagnosed with the following symptoms or diseases when using Aerinaze: • hypertension • heartbeat, palpitations • heart rhythm disorders • nausea and headache or amplification of existing headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Take Aerinaze with other medicines Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you take other medicines or have recently taken it, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Transport and handling of machines When used in the recommended dosage, it is not to be expected that Aerinaze leads to lightheadedness or lowers the attention.</seg>
<seg id="1712">If you have taken a larger amount of Aerinaze than you should inform your doctor or pharmacist immediately if you have taken a larger amount of Aerinaze than you should.</seg>
<seg id="1713">If you forgot the dosage of Aerinaze if you forgot to take a dose in time, get the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the scheduled time.</seg>
<seg id="1714">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if any of the side effects listed will significantly affect you or notice any side effects that are not indicated in this information.</seg>
<seg id="1715">Heart chasing, restlessness with increased physical activity, thinginess, dizziness, sore throat, loss of appetite, constipation, sugar in the urine, increased blood sugar levels, thirst, fatigue, headache, sleep disorders, nervousness, and dizziness.</seg>
<seg id="1716">Heart palpitations or cardiac arrhythmias, increased physical activity, redness, heat flushes, confusion, blurred vision, nasal bleeding, nasal bleeding, nasal irritation, heartburn, reduction of odor, conspicuous liver values, restlessness, anxiety and irritability.</seg>
<seg id="1717">After the market launch of Desloratadin has been very rare reported on cases of severe allergic reactions (breathing difficulties, whistling breathing, itching, nettle rash and swelling) or skin rashes.</seg>
<seg id="1718">Cases of palpitations, heart chase, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, diarrhoea, hallucinations, dizziness, nausea, seizures, restlessness with increased physical activity, cases of liver inflammation and cases of conspicuous liver values were also very rare.</seg>
<seg id="1719">It is available as 5 mg tablet, 5 mg- lyophilisate (soluble tablet), 2.5 Mg- and 5 mg melting tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), 0.5 mg / ml syrup and 0.5 mg / ml solution.</seg>
<seg id="1720">For children aged one to five years, the dose is 1.25 mg once a day, in the form of 2.5 ml syrup or respectively.</seg>
<seg id="1721">For children aged six to eleven years, the dose is 2.5 mg once a day, either in the form of 5 ml syrup or syrup.</seg>
<seg id="1722">Aerius was examined in a total of eight studies involving about 4,800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (including four studies of seasonal allergic rhinitis and two studies to patients who also had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">The effectiveness was measured by identifying changes in symptoms (itch, number and size of paddles, impairment of sleep and performance during the day) before and after six weeks of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies have been submitted to prove that the body utilizes the syrup, the solution to inhale and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In case of allergic rhinitis, if the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg of Aerius increased by 25 to 32%, compared to the decrease of 12 to 26% in patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In the two studies in Urtikaria the decrease of the symptom sheet after six weeks of treatment with Aerius 58 and 67%, compared with 40 and 33% in the patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Erius may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to loratadin, laura adin or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1728">In January 2001, the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe for the placing of Aerius in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">One tablet once a day, with one or without a meal, for alleviating symptoms in allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persisting allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the application of desloratadin in adolescence from 12 to 17 years (see Sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">The treatment of the intermittent allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks) should be done according to the previous disease progression and may be terminated after the symptoms are cleared and resumed upon resuming.</seg>
<seg id="1732">The persisting allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks) can be recommended to the patient during the allergy period a prolonged treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions have not been determined in clinical studies with Disloratadin tablets, in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were given in addition (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical pharmacological study, the performance reduction effect of alcohol was not enhanced while taking Aerius and alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">However, patients should be advised that in very rare cases it may be assumed that there may be an interference with transport or ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1736">In clinical trials in various indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, 3% more side effects were reported in patients with Aerius daily than in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most commonly reported side effects reported more often than placebo were fatigue (1.2%), mouth-dry (0.8%) and headache (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study involving 578 juvenile patients from 12 to 17 years, the most common side effects were headaches, which occurred at 5.9% of patients treated with Disloratadin and 6.9% of patients who were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">No clinically relevant effects were observed in a multiple dose study, which was administered up to 45 mg of desloratadin (nine times clinical dose).</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes inhibiting the release of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 of human mast cells / basophiles as well as the inhibition of the expression of the adult P-selectin on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">As part of a clinical study involving multiple doses of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical pharmacological study, in which desloratadin was administered at a dose of 45 mg daily (the nine times of the clinical dose) over ten days, there was no extension of the Qtc interval.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In a single dose study with adults, Desloratadin 5 mg has no influence on standard measurements of the flight line including the amplification of subjective sleepiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius was effective in alleviating symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, tear fluid and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis may also be divided into intermittent allergic rhinitis and persisting allergic rhinitis depending on the duration of the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persistent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As demonstrated by the total score of the questionnaire for quality of life at Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius effectively reduces the stress caused by the seasonal cause of allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronically idiopathic urticaria was investigated for further forms of urticaria, as the underlying pathophysiology, despite the aetiology, is similar to the different forms and can be easily prospectively recruited for chronic patients.</seg>
<seg id="1750">As histamine release is a causative factor in all urticarial diseases, it is expected that Disloratadin, apart from chronic idiopathic urticaria, also leads to an improvement in the symptoms in other forms of the urticaria; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving the number and number of paddling at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamines in chronic idiopathic urticaria the minority of patients who did not react to antihistamines were excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">Improved itching by more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with Disloratadin compared to 19% of patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">The treatment with Aerius significantly reduced the disturbance of sleep and waking, as measured by a 4-point scale to evaluate these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetic study, in which patients were comparable to the general seasonal allergic rhinitis population, 4% of patients reached a higher concentration of Disloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no clues for clinically relevant accumulation after once daily application of loratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the enzyme responsible for the diabolism of Desloratadin has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines are not completely ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="1758">Desloratadin does not inhibit CYP2D6 in vivo and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 is not inhibitory and is neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dose study with desloratadin at a dose of 7.5 mg, meals (fatty, calorie rich breakfast) did not affect the availability of the loratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1760">The preclinical studies carried out with Disloratadin and Loratadin showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxicity profile of Desloratadin and Loratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Based on conventional safety harmacology studies, toxicity in repeated dose, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data with the loratadin cannot reveal any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1762">Coloured film (contains lactose monohydrate, HyPortless, Titanium dioxide, Macrogol 400, Indigo carmin (E 132)), colourless film (includes Hyunpromo, Macrogol 400), carnauba wax, bleached wax.</seg>
<seg id="1763">Erius can be taken independently of meals, for alleviating symptoms in allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persisting allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The prescribing physician should be aware that most cases of rhinitis in children under 2 years of age are caused by infection (see section 4.4) and that there are no data which support a treatment of infectious Rhinitis with Aerius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">Apart from the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatomic abnormalities, anamnesis, physical examinations and corresponding laboratory and skin tests should play a role in the diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="1766">About 6% of adults and children between 2 and 11 years of age are restricted to metabolic desloratadin and experience higher substance exposure (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">The safety of Aerius syrup in children between 2 and 11 years, which has to be metabolized, is identical to that of children who metabolise normally.</seg>
<seg id="1768">This medicine contains sucrose and sorbitol; therefore, patients with hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose absorption or sucrose isomaltastic insufficiency of this medicine should not take this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1769">Clinically relevant interactions have not been determined in clinical studies with Aerius tablets, in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were given in addition (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1770">In a clinical pharmacological study, the performance reduction effect of alcohol was not enhanced while taking Aerius tablets and alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1771">The overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the Aerius syrup group as in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="1772">In clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in different indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, the recommended dose of 3% reported more side effects in patients with Aerius than in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1773">No clinically relevant effects were observed in a multi-dose study for adults and adolescents with up to 45 mg of desloratadin (nine times clinical dose).</seg>
<seg id="1774">Children between the ages of 1 and 11 who came into question for antihistamine therapy received a daily desloratadindose of 1.25 mg (between 1 and 5 years) or 2.5 mg (aged between 6 and 11 years).</seg>
<seg id="1775">Because the course of allergic rhinitis / chronic idiopathic urticaria and the profile of desloratadin are similar in adults and children, the efficacy data of desloratadin in adults can be extrapolated to the children's population.</seg>
<seg id="1776">As part of a clinical study involving multiple doses of adults and adolescents, in which desloratadin was applied in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1777">In a clinical pharmacological study of adults and adolescents, in which desloratadin was used in a dose of 45 mg daily (the neofold of the clinical dose) over ten days in adults, there was no extension of the Qtc interval.</seg>
<seg id="1778">In controlled clinical studies, the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents showed no increased incidence of drowsiness compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1779">At a single dose of 7.5 mg, Aerius tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical trials did not affect psychomotor activity.</seg>
<seg id="1780">In clinical pharmacological studies in adults, it was neither alcohol-induced nor impaired to increase drowsiness by taking alcohol at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In adult and adolescent patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius tablets were effective in alleviating symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, tear fluid and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1782">As demonstrated by the total score of the questionnaire for quality of life at Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius tablets reduce the effectiveness caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis</seg>
<seg id="1783">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving the number and number of paddling at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The spread of this restricted metabolic phenotype was comparable in adults (6%) and children between 2 and 11 years (6%) and in both populations greater in black (18% adults, 16% children) than in Caucasians (2% adult, 3% children).</seg>
<seg id="1785">Similar pharmacokinetic parameters were observed in a pharmacokinetic multidose study with the syrup formation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhinitis, which may be restricted.</seg>
<seg id="1786">The strain (AUC) by Desloratadin was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the CMAX approximately 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half-life of approximately 120 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1787">There are no clues for clinically relevant active substance accumulation after once daily application of loratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days in adults and adolescents.</seg>
<seg id="1788">12 In various single dose studies, AUC- and CMAx values for pediatric patients were comparable with the recommended doses of pediatric patients with those of adults who received desloratadin syrup in a dose of 5 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1789">However, the enzyme responsible for the diabolism of Desloratadin has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out.</seg>

<seg id="1793">Immediately before application, the blister must be carefully opened and the dose of the lyophilisate must be taken for taking, without damaging it.</seg>
<seg id="1794">Clinically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with Aerius tablets, in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally applied (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1795">In clinical trials in various indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, 3% more side effects in patients with Aerius tablets were reported daily, than in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1796">No clinically relevant effects were observed in a multiple dose study, which had up to 45 mg of desloratadin (nine times clinical dose).</seg>
<seg id="1797">In two single dose studies, Aerius Lyophilisat was well tolerated; this was documented by clinical laboratory results, medical examinations, vital signs and ECG interval data.</seg>
<seg id="1798">As part of a clinical study involving multiple doses of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1799">In a clinical pharmacological study, in which desloratadin was used in a dosage of 45 mg daily (the neofold of the clinical dose) over ten days, there was no extension of the Qtc interval.</seg>
<seg id="1800">In controlled clinical trials at the recommended dosage of 5 mg a day there was no increased incidence of drowsiness compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1801">For a 17 single dose study with adults, Desloratadin 5 mg has no influence on standard measurements of the flight line including amplification of subjective sleepiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1802">In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius tablets were effective in alleviating symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, tear fluid and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1803">As demonstrated by the total score of the questionnaire for quality of life at Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius effectively reduces the stress caused by the seasonal cause of allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1804">18 In a pharmacokinetic study, in which the patients were comparable to the general seasonal allergic rhinitis population, 4% of patients reached a higher concentration of Disloratadin.</seg>

<seg id="1811">The efficacy and safety of Aerius 2.5 mg melting tablets in the treatment of children under 6 years have not been proven yet.</seg>
<seg id="1812">Overall frequency of adverse events between the loratadine syrup and the placebo group was the same and did not differ significantly from the safety profile observed in adult patients.</seg>
<seg id="1813">At the recommended dose, Aerius was used as a bioequivalent to the Aerius 5 mg conventional tablet formulation and the Aerius 5 mg Lyophilisat for the decreasing formulation of Desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1814">As part of a clinical study with multiple doses, in which desloratadin was applied in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically significant</seg>
<seg id="1815">In a single dose study with adults, Desloratadin 5 mg has no influence on standard measurements of the flight line including the amplification of subjective sleepiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1816">The spread of this poorly metabolized phenotype was comparable to adult (6%) and pediatric patients between 2 and 11 years (6%), and under black (adults 18%, children 16%), the safety profile of these patients was however not different from that of the general population.</seg>
<seg id="1817">The formulations were bioequivalent in single dose-crossover studies by Aerius Melting tablets with Aerius 5 mg conventional tablets or Aerius 5 mg lyophilisate.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Aerius 2.5 mg tablets were not studied in pediatric patients, in connection with the dose-finding studies in children, however, the pharmacokinetic data for Aerius melting tablets support the use of 2.5 mg dosage for children from 6 to 11 years.</seg>
<seg id="1819">Food has no significant influence on AUC and CMAX by Aerius Aerius Lyophilisate, while Food Tmax of Desloratadin is extended from 2.5 to 4 hours and Tmax of 3-OH desloratadin from 4 to 6 hours.</seg>

<seg id="1893">June 2008 Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics S.r.l. officially announced the Committee for Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) to prevent aqueous H5N1 influenza in adults and elderly people.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against flu caused by the strain (type) H5N1 of the influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special kind of vaccine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A pandemic outbreak occurs when a new strain of the flu virus appears, which can easily spread from man to person, because humans have not built up immunity (no protection) against it.</seg>
<seg id="1897">When the vaccine is administered, the immune system detects the parts of the flu virus contained in the vaccine as "foreign to the body" and forms antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">As a result, the immune system will later be able to produce antibodies quickly in contact with a flu virus.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently, the membrane cover of the virus with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface, which the human body recognises as a body foreign) has been removed, cleaned and used as part of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">An inspection of some of the study centres showed that the study was not conducted according to the "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>
<seg id="1901">The scope of the clinical data base was not sufficient to assess the safety of the vaccine in order to meet the requirements of the EMEA guidelines for pre-pandemic vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="1902">If you are interested in participating in a clinical trial and require further information regarding your treatment, please contact your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="1903">If you would like more information regarding the CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="1904">It is used in combination with other antiviral drugs for the treatment of adults and children over four years infected with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), which causes the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).</seg>
<seg id="1905">For patients who cannot swallow the capsules, Agenerase is available as a solution for taking the capsules, but this cannot be taken together with Ritonavir as the safety of this combination was not investigated.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Agenerase should only be prescribed when the doctor has checked the antiviral drug the patient has previously taken and the likelihood that the virus is addressed to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years amounts to 600 mg twice daily, which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg of ritonavir and with other antiviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1908">In children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of Agenerase depends on the body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">In combination with other antiviral medicines, Agenerase decreases the HIV-amount in the blood and keeps it at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">Aids do not cure, but may delay the damage to the immune system and thus the development of AIDS related infections and diseases.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenerase was investigated in combination with other antiviral drugs, but without detritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adults, previously not treated with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1912">The dose intensified with low dose ritonavir was compared with other protease inhibitors in 206 adults who used protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non-detectable levels of HIV in the blood (viral load) or the change in the viral load after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies with patients who previously had no protease inhibitors, after 48 weeks under Agenerase, more patients had a viral load of less than 400 copies / ml than placebo, but Agenerase was less effective than indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children Agenerase also reduced the viral load, but only very few of the children who had been treated with protease inhibitors were only very few in the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the adults study previously treated with protease inhibitors, the treatment with Ritonavir increased the viral load after 16-weeks treatment just as effective as other protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other protease inhibitors, Agenerase, together with Ritonavir, came to a stronger decrease in the viral load after four weeks compared to the patients who took up their previous protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of Agenerase (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headaches, diarrhoea (diarrhea), flatulence (flatulence), nausea, vomiting, rash and fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenerase may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to ambriavir or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Agenerase may not be used in patients with St. John's Wort (a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression) or medicines that are degraded just like athermatism and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other drugs against HIV, patients who are taking aspirin are the risk of lipodystrophy (changes in the distribution of body fat), osteodeficiency (death of bone tissue) or immune reactivation syndrome (symptoms of infection caused by the recovered immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Agenerase in combination with other antiretroviral medicines for treatment of HIV-1 infected adults and children over four years outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Agenerase is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetic Ritonavir, but the committee noted that the use of Agenerase in combination with Ritonavir in patients who had not previously taken any protease inhibitors is not proven.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"" "Agenerase was originally licensed under" "" "extraordinary circumstances" "", "because only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Limited to approve the transport of Agenerase across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Agenerase is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral medicines for the treatment of HIV-1, protease inhibitors (PI) pretreated adults and children from 4 years onwards.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Usually, Agenerase capsules are to be given to pharmacokinetic boosters of ambriavir together with low doses of Ritonavir (see Sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of Amprenor should be carried out taking into account the individual viral resistance pattern and pre-treatment of the patient (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of ambriavir as a solution to intake is 14% less than from ambriavir as capsule; therefore, Agenerase capsules and solution for taking on a milligram per milligram basis are not exchangeable (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules amounts to 600 mg of ambriavir twice a day along with 100 mg of ritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Agenerase capsules are used without the amplifying supplement of Ritonavir (booster), higher doses of Agenerase (1200 mg twice daily) need to be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules amounts to 20 mg of ambriavir / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of ambriavir, which should not be exceeded (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">Pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of asgenerase in combination with low doses of ritonavir or other protease inhibitors were not examined in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Agenerase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age, due to lack of data on safety and efficacy (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetic data, the dose of Agenerase capsules in adult patients should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function disorders to 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">Simultaneous use should be taken with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction, in patients with severe liver dysfunction they are contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Agenerase should not be used simultaneously with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and can also present substrates from the cytochrome P450-Isoenzer 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal preparations containing St. John's wort (hypericum perforatum) may not be used because of the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a diminished therapeutic effect of ambriavir during the intake of ambriavir (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be informed that Agenerase or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure of the HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy including the treatment with asgenerase does not prevent the risk of transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Usually, Agenerase capsules are used together with low doses of ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral medicines (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with antiretroviral combination therapy have an increased risk of serious liver side effects, potentially fatal.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the case of an simultaneous antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C, please read the relevant specialist information of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with previously reduced hepatic functions, including chronic hepatitis, showed an increased frequency of hepatic dysfunctions under antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored in accordance with clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">Simultaneous use of asgenerase and ritonavir with fluticasone or other glucocorticosteroids, which are metabolized via CYP3A4, is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment outweigh the risk of systemic corticosteroids including Cushing and Suppression of the adrenal function (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Since the metabolism of the HMG CoA reductase inhibitor lovastatin and Simvastatin is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, a simultaneous administration of agenerase with lovastatin and simvastatin is not recommended because of the increased risk of myopathies including rhabdomyolysis.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some drugs that may cause serious or life-threatening side effects, such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under surveillance of the International Regular Ratio), methods are available for determining the drug concentration.</seg>
<seg id="1948">For patients taking this medicine at the same time, Agenerase may be less effective because of the reduced plasma levels of Ambuavir (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with ampavir, the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives can be altered, but the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadone is simultaneously given with ampavirus at the same time, the patients should therefore be monitored for opthalate symptoms, especially if even lower doses of ritonavir are administered.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Due to the possible risk of toxicity due to the high propylene glycol content of the Agenerase solution, this formulation is contraindicated in children under 4 years of age and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Agenerase should be set for 5 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mucous membranes are involved (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">Patients receiving antiretroviral therapy including protease inhibitors were reported on the occurrence of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia or an existing diabetes mellitus.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other diseases to which drugs were required to be associated with the development of diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. higher age, and associated with drug-dependent factors, such as prolonged antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Hemophilic patients (Type A and B) treated with protease inhibitors are reports of an increase in bleeding, including spontaneous cell haematoma and hemorrhosis.</seg>
<seg id="1957">In HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect, an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART) may develop an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections leading to severe clinical conditions or worsening of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although a multifactorial eology is adopted (including the use of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, heavy immunosuppression, higher Body-Mass-Index), cases of osteodeficiency are particularly reported in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long-term treatment of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with a low therapeutic width of Agenerase should not be used simultaneously with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and can also present substrates from the cytochrome P450-Isoenzer 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with a low therapeutic width Agenerase with Ritonavir may not be used together with medicines whose active ingredients are metabolized via CYP2D6 and are linked to higher plasma levels with serious and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It has been shown that Rifampicin causes a 82% reduction in the AUC of ambriavir, which can lead to virological failure and resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In the attempt to balance the reduced plasma levels by a dose increase of other protease inhibitors in combination with Ritonavir, adverse effects were observed in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="1963">St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) The serum levels of amprenor can be reduced by the simultaneous application of plant preparations with St. John's wort (hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient already takes St. John's wort, the amponavirye mirror and, if possible, check the viral load and suspend the St. John's wort.</seg>
<seg id="1965">A dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not necessary if Nelfinavir is given together with Amprenor (see also Efavirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increases, compared to CMAX by 30%, when ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) is administered in combination with ambriavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical trials, doses of 600 mg of ambriavir were applied twice daily and ritonavir 100 mg twice daily, demonstrating the efficacy and safety of this treatment regimen.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Humbuavir (750 mg twice daily) in combination with Kaleterra (400 mg of Lopinavir + 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily) was administered.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of ampavir (600 mg twice daily) with Kaletra (400 mg of Lopinavir + 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily) are approximately 40 to 50% lower than when Amprenor (600 mg twice a day) is administered twice a day in combination with 100 mg of Ritonavir twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of amprenor and caletra can not be given, however, close-meshed surveillance is recommended, as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">No pharmacokinetic study was carried out in combination with dianosine in combination with dianosine, but due to the inventive component of dianosine it is recommended that the revenues of dianosine and asgenerase are at least one hour apart (see Antazida below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">For this reason, in combination with ambriavir (600 mg twice daily) and ritonavir (100 mg twice daily), dosage adjustment is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1973">The treatment with enamel caviar in combination with amprenor and saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both protease inhibitors would be low.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effects of nevirapin on other protease inhibitors and available limited data suggest that nevirapine may reduce the serum concentration of ampavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If these drugs should be used at the same time, caution is advised, since Delavirdin may be less effective because of the reduced or possibly subtherapeutic plasma levels.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If these drugs are used together, caution is required; thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be undertaken as a precise prediction of the effect of the combination of amprenor and ritonavir on delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous administration of amethavir and rifabutin led to an increase in the plasma concentration (AUC) of Rifabutin by 193%, resulting in an increase in side effects associated with Rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer Rifabutin together with Agenerase, the dose of Rifabutin will be reduced to at least half of the recommended dose, although there are no clinical data.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with erythromycin in combination with erythromycin have not been performed, however the plasma levels of both pharmaceuticals could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Simultaneous application of twice a day 700 mg of fritonavir and 100 mg of ketoconazol once daily led to an increase in the CMAX of ketoconazol in plasma by 25% and the AUC (0-τ) once daily without simultaneous application of Fosamprenoar with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines listed below, including substrates, inhibitors, or inductors of CYP3A4 can possibly lead to interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be monitored on toxic reactions associated with these drugs if they are used in combination with asgenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other protease inhibitors, it is advisable that antacids are not taken at the same time as Agenerase because it can result in erectile dysfunction.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Simultaneous use of anticonvulants known as enzyme reducers (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), with Amprenor, can result in a degradation of the plasma levels of Amprenor.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as amlodipine, diltiazem, riopin, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nipodipine, nipodipine, nifedipine, nipodipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nimodipine, nipodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, ni</seg>
<seg id="1986">Simultaneous ingestion with aspirin can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and strengthen with PDE5 inhibitors associated with side effects including hypotension, visual disturbances and priapism (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study where Ritonavir was given 100 mg capsules twice a day along with 50 µg of fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily), the fluorticasonpropionate plasma levels increased significantly while the endogenous cortisol decreased by about 86% (90% confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, the simultaneous administration of Agenerase with Ritonavir together with these glucocorticosteroids is not recommended, unless the potential benefits of treatment outweigh the risk of systemic corticosteroids (see paragraph 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">HMG CoA reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose metabolism is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, are marked increases in plasmasping while administering Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Because plasma levels of these HMG CoA reductase inhibitors can lead to myopathy including a rhabdomyolysis, the combined application of these drugs is not recommended with ampaviar.</seg>
<seg id="1991">More frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations to the stabilization of the mirrors is recommended as the plasma concentrations of cyclosporine, rapamycin and tacrolimus can be increased with the simultaneous administration of ambriavir (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, Agenerase should not be used together with Midazolam (see Section 4.3), while with simultaneous use of Agenerase with parenteral midazolam caution is advisable.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for simultaneous use of parenteral midazolam with other protease inhibitors indicate a possible increase in the plasma levels of Midazolam around 3 to 4 times.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If methadone is administered together with ampavir, the patients should therefore be monitored on oppiate withdrawal symptoms, especially if even lower doses of ritonavir are administered.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Because of the low reliability of historical comparisons, no recommendation can currently be given, such as the ambriavirus dose can be adjusted if Amprenor is given at the same time with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">In the case of simultaneous administration of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants together with Agenerase, increased control of INR (International Regular Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of debilitating or reinforcing the antithrombotic effect (see paragraph 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of supplementing Ritonavir on hormonal contraceptives is not predictable, therefore alternative contraception methods are recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended with the simultaneous administration of aspirin (see paragraph 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">During pregnancy, this medicine may be used only after careful weighing of the possible benefit for the mother in comparison with the possible risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">In the milk of lacing rats, ampavir related substances were detected, but it is not known whether or not ampavir is transferred to the mother's milk.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproduction study on pregnant rats, which was given by the incorporation into the uterus until the end of the breastfeeding period, showed a diminished increase of 12 body weight in seed.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The further development of offspring including fertility and reproductive capacity was not affected by the administration of Amprenor to the dam.</seg>
<seg id="2003">Agenerase's harmlessness has been studied in adults and children over 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most of the side effects associated with the Agenerase treatment were mild to moderate, rose early and rarely led to the termination of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2005">In many of these events, it is not clarified whether they are connected to the use of aspirin or another medicine used simultaneously for the treatment of HIV, or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the side effects mentioned below are from two clinical trials (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), in which patients treated with protease inhibitors received 1200 mg of asgenerase twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (Grade 2 to 4) assessed by the investigators as in connection with study medication and performed in more than 1% of patients as well as laboratory changes occurring in the treatment (Grade 3 to 4) are listed.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Antiretroviral combination therapy was associated with a redistribution of the body fat (lipodystrophy) in HIV patients, including a loss of peripheral and differential visceral fat tissues, hypertrophy of the breasts and dorso@-@ cervical fat accumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2009">Among 113 previously untreated patients treated with ambriavir in combination with lamivudine / zidovudine for a mean time of 36 weeks, only one case (Stiernacken) (&lt; 1%) was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the study PROJ3006 in 245 NRTI- pre-treated patients under Amprenor 7 cases (3%) compared to 27 cases (11%) in 241 patients under indinavir, in combination with various NRTIs for an average duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0.001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Rashes were usually light up to moderately pronounced, erythematous or makulopapulous nature, with or without itching and occurred usually during the second treatment week and vanished spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with ampavirus had to be canceled.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Osteodeficiency cases were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors, advanced HIV infection or long-term treatment of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">In HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect, an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART) may develop an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections (see paragraph 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">In with PI pre-treated patients receiving 600 mg of Agenerase two times a day along with low dose ritonavir (Grade 3 and 4) were comparable to those observed under certain agroase treatment; an exception formed increases in the triglyceride and CPK values obtained in patients who received Agenerase along with low dose ritonavir, very often.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In case of overdose, the patient is aware of signs of intoxication (see Section 4.8) if necessary, necessary supportive measures.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Amprenor binds to the active center of the HIV-1 protease and thus prevents the processing of viral gastric and gag-polar polyproteinlevels as a result of the formation of unripe, non infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The antiviral activity of ampavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was investigated on acute and chronic lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) and peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% Hemmconcentration (IC50) of Amprenor lies in the range of 0,012 to 0.08 µM in acutely infected cells and amounts to 0,41 µM in chronic infected cells</seg>
<seg id="2019">The connection between the activity of ampavir against HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibition of HIV-1 replication in humans is not yet defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment of antiretroviral non-treated patients with the currently approved type of fritonavir and detritonavir dosages - as with other ritonavir protease inhibitors - the mutations described are rarely observed.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In sixteen out of 434 antiretroviral non-pre-treated patients receiving 700mg of fossils with 100mg of ritonavir twice a day in the ESS100732 trial, a virological failure occurred up to week 48, whereby 14 isolates could be genotypically examined.</seg>
<seg id="2022">Genotypic analysis of the isolate of 13 out of 14 children, in which a virological failure occurred within 59, with protease inhibitors not previously treated patients showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults.</seg>

<seg id="2024">In the APV30003 study and its extension APV30005 (700 mg of Fosamprenor / 100 mg of ritonavir twice daily: n = 107), patients with virological failure occurred over 96 weeks for the following protease inhibitor mutations:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Genotypic resistance testing based analyses of genotypic interpretation systems can be used to estimate the activity of ambriavir / ritonavir or Fosamprenor / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitor-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for Fosampreneavir / Ritonavir defines resistance as the presence of mutations L10F / I, L33F, M36I, I54A / L / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M /</seg>
<seg id="2027">The conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mutations or mutation patterns may be subject to changes through additional data, and it is recommended to always attract the current interpretation systems for analysis of the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Phenotypic interpretation systems based on phenotypic resistance testing can be used in combination with genotypic data to estimate the activity of ambriavir / ritonavir or Fosamprenor / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitor-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies that distribute diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinical-phenotypic cut-offs (separation points) for FPV / RTV, which can be used to interpret the results of resistance testing.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each genetic pattern that is associated with a reduced sensitivity to Amprenor generates a certain cross-resistance against Ritonavir, the sensitivity to indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir stays in general maintained.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data on cross-resistance between ampavir and other protease inhibitors for all 4 types of fossa, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">Based on twenty-five antiretroviral non-pre-treated patients (one of 25 isolates), Darinavir / Ritonavir (three out of 25 isolates), Darinavir / Ritonavir (three out of 24 isolates), saquinavir / Ritonavir (three out of 24 isolates), and Tidenavir / Ritonavir (four out of 24 isolates).</seg>
<seg id="2033">On the other hand, Amprenor retains its activity against some other protease inhibitor-resistant isolates; maintaining this activity appears to depend on the number and type of resistance-mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The early departure of a seeding therapy is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mutations that can adversely affect the subsequent treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The evidence of the efficacy of Agenerase in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice a day is based on the study PRO30017, a randomized open study (600 mg twice daily) and Nucleavdaniela (100 mg twice daily) and Nucleosidaniela (NRTI) or a standard therapy (standard of care, SOC) with PI, mainly used with low-dose ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred and sixty (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to Agenerase, at least another PI and at least one NRTI were included in the A of PRO30017 partial study.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis determined the non-supremacy of APV / Ritonavir in the viral load (AAUCMB) in the viral load (AAUCMB) in the viral load (HIV-1 RNA) in plasma after 16 weeks, in a non-underlaying threshold of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">Evidence of the effectiveness of unblocked aperiase is based on two uncontrolled trials of 288 HIV infected children aged 2 to 18, of which 152 were pre-treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, Agenerase was tested twice daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">No low dosed pinion was given at the same time; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs administered together with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks, approximately 25% of the patients included in the study had a plasma-HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml with median increase in CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to baseline.</seg>
<seg id="2042">"" "19 Based on this data, the benefits of" "" "unbleached" "" "Agenerase should be considered in therapy optimisation for children treated with PI." ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">After oral dosing, the average duration (Tmax.) is about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508%, by contrast, reduced by 30% for CMAX, when ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered together with ampavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of Amprenor with a meal leads to a 25% decrease in the AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of ambriavir 12 hours after dosing (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore, the minimum concentration in the steady state (Cmin, ss) remained unaffected by the intake of food, although the simultaneous food intake was influenced by the extent and rate of absorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l (6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg) and can be concluded on a large distribution volume as well as an unimpeded penetration of ambriavir from the bloodstream into the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma, whereby the amount of involuntary ambriavir, which represents the active portion, probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of an unconnected amp remains constant, the percentage of free active constituent fluctuates during the dosing interval in dependence on the total drug concentration in the Steady State over the range of CMAX, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, medicines that induce or inhibit CYP3s or present a substrate of CYP3A4 have to be administered cautiously if they are given at the same time with Agenerase (see Sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>

<seg id="2194">Although limited data indicates an increased rate of secretion reductions in HIV positive patients, Imiquimod-cream has shown lower effectiveness in this patient group with regard to the removal of the genital warts.</seg>
<seg id="2195">Treatment of basal cell carcinoma with Imiquimod within 1 cm around the eyelids, nose, lips or hairline was not examined.</seg>
<seg id="2196">Local skin reactions are frequent, but the intensity of these reactions decreases in general during therapy or the reactions form after completion of treatment with Imiquimod cream.</seg>
<seg id="2197">If it is necessary due to patient complaints or due to the severity of local skin reactions, a treatment period may be done several days.</seg>
<seg id="2198">The clinical outcome of the therapy may be assessed after regeneration of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2199">As there are currently no data on long-term healing rates of more than 36 months after treatment, other suitable forms of therapy should be taken into consideration in case of superpotent basal cell carcinomas.</seg>
<seg id="2200">In patients with recurrent and pre-treated BCCs there is no clinical experience, therefore the use of pre-treated tumours is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2201">Data from an open clinical study suggest that large tumours (&gt; 7,25 cm2) are less likely to respond to Imiquimod therapy.</seg>
<seg id="2202">Imiquimod was not studied for the treatment of actinic keratoses on eyelids, inside the nose or ears or on the lip area within the crib.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Only very limited data on the use of Imiquimod for the treatment of actin keratoses in anatomical places outside the face and scalp are available.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The available data on the actin keratose on the forearms and hands do not support the effectiveness in this application, therefore such an application is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Local skin reactions often occur, but these reactions usually decrease in intensity over the course of therapy or go back after the treatment with Imiquimod cream.</seg>
<seg id="2206">If local skin reactions cause great discomfort to the patient or are very strong, treatment may be suspended for a few days.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Data from an open clinical study showed that patients with more than 8 lesions showed a lower total healing rate than patients with less than 8 lesions.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Due to immuno-stimulating properties, Imiquimod cream should be used with caution in patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment (see 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2209">Animal studies do not result in direct or indirect effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, debinding or postnatal development (see 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2210">Although quantifiable serum levels (&gt; 5ng / ml) were achieved neither after one-time nor after repeated topical application, no recommendation can be given for the application during breastfeeding.</seg>
<seg id="2211">The most commonly shared and possibly or possibly with the application of Imiquimod cream in the studies with three-week treatment were local reactions in the location of treatment of genital warts (33.7% of patients treated with Imiquimod treated patients).</seg>
<seg id="2212">Among the most commonly reported and considered probable or possibly with the application of Imiquimod cream in the related side effects include discomfort on the application site with an incidence of 28.1%.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Side-effects reported by 185 with Imiquimod-cream from a placebo-controlled phase III clinical trial are shown below.</seg>
<seg id="2214">The most common adverse event, probably or possibly with the application of Imiquimod cream, was a reaction to the application location (22% of patients treated with Imiquimod treated patients).</seg>
<seg id="2215">The side effects specified in 252 in placebo-controlled clinical trials of phase III with Imiquimod-cream treated patients with actin keratose are listed below.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The evaluation of the clinical signs indicated by the test plan shows that in these placebo-controlled clinical trials with three-week treatment with Imiquimod cream frequently lead to local skin reactions including erythema (61%), erosion (30%), excreoriation / descent (23%) and oedema (14%) (see paragraph 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2217">The evaluation of the clinical signs indicated by the test plan shows that in these studies, five times weekly treatment with Imiquimod cream was very common to severe erythema (31%), severe erosions (13%), and too severe scarring and cemination (19%).</seg>
<seg id="2218">In clinical trials for the treatment of Imiquimod for the treatment of the actin keratosis, alopecia was diagnosed with an incidence of 0.4% (5 / 1214) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The inadvertent oral intake of 200 mg of Imiquimod, which corresponds to the content of approximately 16 bags, could result in nausea, vomiting, headache, myalgia and fever.</seg>
<seg id="2220">The clinically serious side-effect which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg consisted in hypotonia, which normalized after oral or intravenous fluids.</seg>
<seg id="2221">Systemic concentrations of alpha-interferons and other cytokines have been detected in pharmacokinetic investigations according to the topical application of Imiquimod.</seg>
<seg id="2222">In 3 pivotal phase 3 efficacy studies could be demonstrated that the efficacy of a complete healing of the genital warts in Imiquimod treatment over 16 weeks of placebo treatment is significantly superior.</seg>
<seg id="2223">60% of the patients treated with Imiquimod treated the genital warts completely; this was the case with 20% of the patients who were treated with placebo (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2224">Complete healing was achieved at 23% of 157 treated with Imiquimod treated male patients, compared to 5% of 161 treated male patients (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2225">Imiquimod's effectiveness in five times per week over 6 weeks was investigated in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="2226">The target tumors were histologically confirmed individual primary artificial basal cell carcinomas with a minimum size of 0.5 cm2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The data presented in an open, uncontrolled long-term study after four years show that approximately 79.3% [95% CI (73.7%, 84.9%)] of all treated patients were clinically cured and this remained for 48 months.</seg>
<seg id="2228">The effectiveness of Imiquimod three times weekly application in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks, interrupted by a four-week, treatment-free period, was examined in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Patients had clinically typical, visible, discrete, non-hyperkeratoid, non-hypertrophic ac- lesions within a related 25 cm2 treatment area on the unhairy scalp or face.</seg>
<seg id="2230">The one-year data from two combined observation studies indicate a recurrence rate of 27% (35 / 128 patients) for patients with clinical radiation after one or two treatment periods.</seg>
<seg id="2231">The approved indications of external genital warts, actin keratose and superficient basal cell carcinoma usually do not occur in pediatric patients and have therefore not been studied.</seg>
<seg id="2232">Aldara Cream was studied in four randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled trials involving children aged 2 to 15 with Molluscum contagiosum (Imiquimod n = 576, placebo n = 313).</seg>
<seg id="2233">The effectiveness of Imiquimod could not be shown in these studies in the doses investigated there (3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or respectively.</seg>
<seg id="2234">Minimal systemic inclusion of the 5% Imiquimod cream through the skin of 58 patients with actin keratose was observed during the three-week application during 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">The highest drug concentrations in the serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0.1, 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face (12.5 mg, 1 disposable bag), on the scalp (25 mg, 2 pouches) and on the hands / arms (75 mg, 6 pouches).</seg>
<seg id="2236">The estimated obvious half-life was about 10 times higher than the 2 hour half-life after the subcutaneous use in an earlier study; this indicates an extended retention of the medicine in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Data on systemic exposure showed that the resorption of Imiquimod after topical application on MC-infected skin of patients aged 6 to 12 was low and comparable to that in healthy adults and adults with actin keratose or superbly basal cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2238">In a four month study on dermal toxicity in rats doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg kg resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased spleen weight; a study of the dermal application carried out four months also yielded no similar effects for the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2239">A two-year study on carcinogenicity in mice on three days a week induced no tumours at the scope of application.</seg>
<seg id="2240">The appropriate mechanism is not known, but since Imiquimod possesses only a low systemic adsorption of the human skin and is not mutagen, it is a risk for humans to look very low due to systemic exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The tumors performed in the group of mice treated with the active-free cream, earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low UVR.</seg>

<seg id="2265">A reduced number of blood cells can make you more susceptible to infections; it can cause you to develop a blue spot faster, or it can cause supremacy.</seg>
<seg id="2266">Tell your doctor or pharmacist if one of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or notice any side effects that are not indicated in this information.</seg>
<seg id="2267">In addition, you can feel itching (32% of patients), burning (26% of patients) or pain in the areas you have applied Aldara cream (8% of patients).</seg>
<seg id="2268">Usually these are lighter skin reactions which disappear again within about 2 weeks after the treatment has been stopped.</seg>
<seg id="2269">Occasionally some patients notice changes in the application location (wound secretion, inflammation, swelling, scarring, skin disorders, blisters, dermatitis) or irritability, nausea, dry mouth, flu-like symptoms and fatigue.</seg>

<seg id="2271">Aldurazyme is used for enzyme therapy in patients with confirmed diagnosis of a Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I; α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (the symptoms that are not associated with brain or nerves).</seg>
<seg id="2272">This means that certain substances (glycosaminoglycans, gags) are not degraded and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them.</seg>
<seg id="2273">The following non-neurological symptoms of MPS I can occur: enlarged liver, stiff joints, which complicate movements, decreased lung volume, heart and eye diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2274">Treatment with Aldurazyme should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2275">The administration of Aldurazyme should be administered in a hospital or clinic with revitalization devices, and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to the administration to prevent an allergic reaction.</seg>

<seg id="2277">The study was mainly focused on the safety of the drug, but its effectiveness was also measured (by examining its effect on reducing GAG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under the age of five, Aldurazyme lowered GAG concentrations in the urine by about 60%, and half of the treated children showed a normal liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of Aldurazyme in patients aged over five years (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headaches, nausea, stomach pain, arthropathy (joint pain), back pain, pain in the limbs (in hands and feet), heat sensation, fever and reactions at the infusion site.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very common adverse events in patients under five years of age are elevated blood pressure, decreased oxygen saturation (a measurement of lung function), tachycardia (accelerated heart rate), fever and chills.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme may not be used in patients who may be highly sensitive to laronidase or any of the other components (anaphylactic reaction).</seg>
<seg id="2282">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review every year all the new information that may be known, and, if necessary, update this summary if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The manufacturer of Aldurazyme will observe patients who receive Aldurazyme with regard to the reactions to infusion and the development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission granted approval to Genzyme Europe B.V. to approve Aldurazyme in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of human α -L-Iduronidase and is produced using recombinant DNA technology using CHO mammalian cell cultures (Chinese Hamster Ovary, ovary of Chinese hamster).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indicated for long-term enzyme therapy in patients with confirmed diagnosis of a Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) in order to treat non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">Treatment with Aldurazyme should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient carries this up, increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in adults over 65 years has not been determined, and for these patients no dosing schedule can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in patients with kidney or liver failure has not been identified, and for these patients no dosing schedule can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with Aldurazyme can develop infusion-related reactions that are defined as any side effect occurring during infusion or until the end of the infusion day (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored, and the infusion of Aldurazyme should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical setting in which revitalization systems for medical emergencies are immediately available.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase 3 study, nearly all patients with IgG antibodies form against laronidase, usually within 3 months from the beginning of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of infusion-related reaction must be treated with caution when using Aldurazyme (see Sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Since there is little experience regarding the resumption of treatment after a longer break, due to the theoretically increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions after an interruption of treatment, it is necessary to proceed cautiously.</seg>
<seg id="2296">Pre-treatment 60 minutes before beginning of infusion with medication (antihistamines and / or anti-pyreagents) in order to minimize the potential occurrence of infusion-related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of a slight or medium-severe infusion-related reaction, treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen should be considered and / or reduction of infusion rate to half of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In case of a single, severe infusion-related reaction, the infusion must be stopped until the symptoms are slowed down, treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen is considered.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Infusion can be re-recorded by reducing the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 (antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen and / or corticosteroids) and reduction of infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the previous reaction has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be used simultaneously with chloroquin or procaine, because there is a potential risk of interfering with the intracellular absorption of laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal experimental studies do not indicate direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since there are no data on newborns exposed to laronidase over breast milk, it is recommended not to breastfeed during treatment with Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">Adverse events in clinical trials were mainly classified as infusion-related reactions, which were observed in 53% of patients in phase 3 (up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study with participants under 5 years (duration of treatment up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Adverse drug reactions related to Aldurazyme observed during the phase 3 study and its extension in a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older at a treatment duration of up to 4 years are presented in the following table according to the following frequencies: very common (≥ 1 / 10); frequently (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related involvement of upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre-history severe reactions arose, including bronchospasm, respiratory reliance and facial oil (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children Undesirable drug interactions associated with Aldurazyme, which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5, with predominantly severe trial form and a treatment duration up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Most patients had a seroconic version within 3 months of the beginning of the treatment, with a heavier follow-up form in patients aged under 5 (average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 years and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Until the end of the Phase 3 study (or up to a premature withdrawal from the study), no radioimmunophilic (RIP) assay showed detectable antibodies, including 3 patients with whom it never came to Serokonversion.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with a lack of up to low antibody levels demonstrated a robust decrease of the GAG mirror in urine, while in patients with high antibody levels a variable reduction of GAG in urine was determined.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in phase III study and one in phase 2 study) showed a marginal to low neutralising inhibitory effect on enzymatic larvae activity in vitro, which did not appear to affect clinical efficacy and / or reduction of GAG in urine.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies did not appear to be associated with the incidence of adverse drug reactions, even if the incidence of adverse drug reactions were typically associated with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The reason for the enzyme therapy is one for the hydrolysis of the accumulative medium and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient enzyme activity.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After IV infusion, laronidase is quickly removed from the circulation and absorbed into the lysosomes, most likely via mannose-6-phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">Safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme were examined in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study to 45 patients aged 6 to 43.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study that showed the entire disease spectrum, the majority of patients from the mean phenotype and only one patient showed the severe phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had an accelerated expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary efficacy endpoints were the percentage change of the expected FEV and the absolute distance in the 6-minute walk.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were subsequently recruited for an open-label extension study where they received 100 E / kg of Aldurazyme for another 3.5 years (182 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy, patients treated with Aldurazyme showed improvement in lung function and the ability to salvage treated in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">The open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group, as indicated in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The acceptance of the expected percentage FEV is clinically not significant during this period and the absolute lung volumes increased proportionally to the body size of adults.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with a hepatomegaly before treatment 22 (85%) reached a normal liver size until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks, a clear decrease of the GAG mirrors was detected in the urine (µg / mg Kreatinin), which remained constant until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">In view of the heterogeneous disease incidence between the patients being taken into account by using a combined end point (expected percentage of normal FEV, distance in 6-minute walk, range of motion of the shoulder joint AHI and visual acuity), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a deterioration in 9 patients (20%) was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2327">A one-year open phase 2 study was carried out, mainly investigating the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme in 20 patients who were under 5 years old at the time of their inclusion (16 patients with severe course form and 4 with the mean follow-up form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to increased Gag- Mirror in Harn in week 22.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a size growth (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) were determined according to the Z score for this age group The younger patients with the mean follow-up form showed a normal mental development rate, whereas in older patients with severe course of course only limited or no advances in cognitive development were determined.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study, studies on pharmacodynamic effects of various Aldurazyme dosing regimens were carried out on the GAG mirror in the urine, liver volume and the 6-minute test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously once weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks can be a reasonable alternative for patients who have difficulties with weekly infusions; however, it is not proven that the long-term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing regimens is equivalent.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review any new information available annually, and if necessary, the summary of the characteristics of the medicine will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2334">Pharmacokinetic profile in patients under the age of 5 was similar to those affected by older and less severely affected patients.</seg>

<seg id="2347">Instructions for handling - dilution and application The concentrate for the preparation of an infusion solution must be diluted prior to the application and is intended for intravenous use (see information for doctors and medical specialists).</seg>
<seg id="2348">The initial fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient is wearing this, all 15 minutes are gradually increased to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2349">In some patients with severe MPS-I--related involvement of upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre-history severe reactions arose, including bronchospasm, respiratory reliance and facial oil.</seg>
<seg id="2350">Very common (occurrence with more than 1 of 10 patients): • headache • nausea • stomach pain • rash • Joint disorders, joint pain, back pain, pain in arms and legs • increased pulse • hypertension • less oxygen in the blood • Reaction at the infusion station</seg>
<seg id="2351">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review any new information available annually, and if necessary, the package will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2352">If the ready-to-use preparation is not immediately used, it is no longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C - 8º C, if the dilution was done under controlled and validated aseptic conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2353">Preparation of the Alduracyme infusion (using aseptic technique) • Depending on the body weight of the individual patient, determine the number of perpendicular vials to be diluted.</seg>
<seg id="2354">Alimta is used together with cisplatin (another drug against cancer) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy (drugs against cancer) and "maligne" (malignant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body). • advanced or metastatic "non-small" lung cancer that does not attack the squamous cells.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Alimta is used as sole treatment in patients who have not previously been treated in combination with cisplatin and in patients who have previously received other chemotherapies.</seg>
<seg id="2356">To reduce side effects, the patients should take a corticosteroid as well as folic acid (a vitamin) during the treatment with Alimta and receive injections of vitamin B12.</seg>
<seg id="2357">If Alimta is administered together with cisplatin, an "antiemetic" (medicines for vomiting) and liquids ought to be given before or after the administration of cisplatin (in order to prevent a lack of fluid).</seg>
<seg id="2358">In patients whose blood is changed or where certain other side effects occur, treatment should be delayed, removed or the dose should be lessened.</seg>
<seg id="2359">The active form of Ptelrexed thus slows down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells being divided.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The transformation of pemetrexed into its active form is easier in cancer cells than in healthy cells, leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the medicine and a longer active lifetime in cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">In a primary study, Alimta was examined in 456 patients who had not previously received chemotherapy against their disease.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer the Alimta effects in a study of 571 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease, previously treated with chemotherapy, were compared with the effects of docetaxel (another drug against cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">Alimta was also compared to gemcitabine (another drug against cancer), both in combination with cisplatin in a study involving 1 725 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2364">Patients treated with Alimta and cisplatin survived on average 12.1 months, compared to 9.3 months in the allotted administration of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2365">Patients receiving chemotherapy prior to chemotherapy was the average survival time with Alimta 8.3 months, compared to 7.9 months in docetaxel.</seg>
<seg id="2366">In both studies, however, patients in whom cancer did not attack the squamous epithelial cells was longer survival times in the administration of Alimta than with the comparison medication.</seg>
<seg id="2367">In September 2004, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Eli Lilly Nederland B.V. to launch Alimta in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Each flow bottle must be dissolved with 4.2 ml 0.9% sodium chloride injections (9 mg / ml), resulting in a solution of 25 mg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2369">The corresponding volume of the necessary dosage is taken from the flow bottle and diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride injections (9 mg / ml) to 100 ml (see paragraph 6.6).</seg>
<seg id="2370">ALIMTA is indicated in combination with cisplatin for first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, except for overlapping plate-epithelial histology (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2371">ALIMTA in monotherapy is indicated for treatment in second-line treatment of patients with localized or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, except for overlapping plate-epithelial histology (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2372">The recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² of body surface (KOF) is administered intravenous infusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The recommended dose of cisplatin amounts to 75 mg / m ² of KOF as an infusion about a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after completion of the pemetrexed- infusion on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2374">In patients with non-small cell lung cancer following previous chemotherapy, the recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² KOF is given as intravenous infusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2375">For the reduction of frequency and severity of skin reactions, a corticosteroid must be given the day before and on the day after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2376">During the seven days before the first dose of Ptelrexed, a minimum of 5 doses of folic acid must be taken and the dose must be continued throughout the treatment period as well as for another 21 days after the last pemetrexed- dose.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Patients must also receive an intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 micrograms) in the week before the first pemetrexed dose, as well as after every third treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2378">In patients receiving pemetrexed, a complete blood picture should be created before each administration, including a differentiation of the leukocytes and a thrombocyte count.</seg>
<seg id="2379">Alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate transaminase (AST or SGOT) and alanine-transaminase (ALT or SGPT) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value.</seg>
<seg id="2380">A dose check must take place at the beginning of a new treatment cycle taking into account the Nadirs of the blood picture or the maximum non-haematological toxicity of the previous treatment cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2381">After recovery, patients need to be treated according to the indications in tables 1, 2 and 3 that apply for ALIMTA as monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria are in line with the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC degree 2 bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2383">Should patients develop non-haematological toxicity ≥ degree 3 (except neurotoxicity), the treatment with ALIMTA has to be interrupted until the patient receives the value before the treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">The treatment with ALIMTA has to be canceled if a hematological toxicity or non-haematological toxicity degree 3 or 4 occurs in patients after 2 dose-reductio- or non-haematological toxicity level 3 or 4 or so - in case of Grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical studies showed no indication that in patients aged 65 years or above, an increased risk of side effects was increased compared to patients aged 65 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical trials, no dose adaptations were needed in patients with a creatinin clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min, which go beyond the dose adaptations recommended for all patients.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data situation in patients with a creatinin clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore, the application is not recommended (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5-fold upper Bilimania limit and / or transaminase values of &gt; the 3.0-fold upper limit value (in case of liver metastases) or &gt; 5.0 times the upper limit value (in presence of liver metastases) were not specifically investigated in the studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients need to be surveilled with immunosuppression and Ptelrexed must not be given to patients before their absolute neutralisation returns a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thrombocytes again has reached a value of ≥ 100.000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">A dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of the absolute number of neutrophils, thrombocytes and maximum non-haematological toxicity observed in previous treatment cycles (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction in level 3 / 4 haematological and non-haematological toxicity such as neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with degree 3 / 4 neutropenia was observed when a pre-treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore all patients with pemetrexed need to be instructed to apply folic acid and vitamin B12 as a prophylactic measure to reduce treatment-related toxicity (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency (creatinin-Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) must avoid simultaneous use of non-steroidal anti-phlogistika (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and acetylsali- cylacid (&gt; 1,3 g daily) for at least 2 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with pemetrexed (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients, for whom a therapy with Ptelrexed is intended, must avoid taking NSAIDs with long half-life for at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with Ptelrexed (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients with such occurrences had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of renal events including dehydration, pre-existing hypertension or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">In patients with clinically significant fluid buildup in the transcellular space a drainage of the effusion is planned before the Ptelrexed treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 severe cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials with pemetrexed when this active ingredient is usually given in combination with another cytotoxic substance.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason, the simultaneous use of attenuated living vaccines (except yellow fever, this vaccination is contraindicated) is not recommended (see Section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">Since the possibility of an irreversible degradation of the reproductive capacity by Ptelrexed, men should be advised against the treatment of the tin to obtain advice regarding the sperm conservation.</seg>
<seg id="2401">In patients with normal kidney function (Kreatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of nonsteroidal antiphlogistika (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylic acid in high dosage (≥ 1,3 g daily) can lead to a reduced pemetrexed excretion with the result of an increased occurrence of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Caution is advised if high doses of NSAIDs or acetaminoylsalicylic acid can be used in patients with normal kidney function (Kreatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen) or acetylsalicylic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days prior to therapy, to be avoided on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with pemetrexed (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Because there is no data regarding the interaction potential with NSAIDs with long half-life such as Piro- xicam or Rofecoxib, the simultaneous application with Ptelrexed must be avoided at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with pemetrexed.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The great intra-individual variability of clotting status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anticoagulants and antineoplastic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of INR (International Regular Ratio) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anticoagulants.</seg>
<seg id="2406">No data is available for the use of emetrexed in pregnant women, but as with ande- ren multimetabolites, serious birth defects are expected in the pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Telemetrexed may not be used during pregnancy unless it is essential and after careful consideration of the benefit for the mother and the risk for the foetus (see paragraph 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2408">Since the possibility of an irreversible damage to the reproductive capacity by Ptelrexed, men should be advised to consult with regard to the sperm count.</seg>
<seg id="2409">It is not known whether pemetrexed goes into breast milk and unwanted effects in the breastfed baby can not be ruled out.</seg>

<seg id="2507">In both studies in patients with BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2, patients who took Alli 60 mg took an average weight loss of 4.8 kg, compared to 2.3 kg in the intake of placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2508">In the study with Alli in patients with BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2, no relevant weight loss could be observed for patients.</seg>
<seg id="2509">The most common side effects of Alli (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are oily patches with the anus, flurinary tract (winds) with stuglabia, stepped fume, greasy / oily chair, passage of oily secretion (feces), flatulence (winds) and soft stools.</seg>

<seg id="2517">The probability of occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms (see Section 4.8) can increase if alli is taken together with a fat-rich single-meal or a fat-rich diet.</seg>
<seg id="2518">As the weight reduction in diabetes can be associated with improved metabolic control, patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmacist before starting a therapy with alli because the dose of antidiabetic needs to be adapted if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Patients who take alli as well as medicines for hypertension or elevated cholesterol levels should consult their doctor or pharmacist if the dose of these drugs has to be adapted.</seg>
<seg id="2520">It is recommended to take additional pregnancy-prevention measures to prevent the possible failure of oral contraception in case of severe diarrhoea (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2521">In a study on the interaction of pharmaceuticals as well as in several cases with simultaneous application of orlistat and Ciclosporin, a decrease in the Ciclosporin plasma glucose was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2522">When using warfarin or other oral anticoagulants in combination with orlistat, the Quick values (international normal ratio, INR) could be affected (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2523">Most patients who were treated with orlistat in clinical trials up to 4 full years remained the concentration of vitamins A, D, E and K as well as beta-carotene in the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2524">However, the patient should be advised to take an additional multivitamin supplement before bedtime to ensure adequate vitamine absorption (see paragraph 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2525">After the administration of a one-time dose Amiodarone was observed with a limited number of healthy volunteers who received orlistat at the same time, observed a slight decrease in the Amiodarone plasma concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2526">Experimental studies showed no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal and are related to pharmacological effects of the drug, as the absorption of absorbed fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">Gastrointestinal side effects were determined from clinical trials with orlistat 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The frequencies are defined as follows: very frequently (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), rare (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000) and very rare (&lt; 1 / 10.000), not known (frequency based on available data is not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The frequency of reported side-effects noted after the introduction of orlistat is not known, since these events were reported voluntarily by a population of a certain size.</seg>
<seg id="2531">† It is plausible that the treatment with alli may lead to anxiety in terms of possible or actual gastrointestinal side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Single doses of 800 mg of orlistat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days in normal and overweight subjects without significant clinical findings.</seg>
<seg id="2533">In most of the reported cases of orlistat overdose, no side effects or similar side effects were reported as reported at the recommended dose of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on investigations on humans and animals, a rapid reformation of possible systemic effects, which can be traced back to the listiguing properties of orlistat, can be assumed.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The therapeutic effect prevails in the lumen of the stomach and the upper small intestine by means of covalent bonding to the active serine remnant of gastric and pankreatic lids.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Clinical studies have been derived that 60 mg of orlistat, taken three times a day, have blocked absorption of approximately 25% of the dietary fat.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Two double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled studies in adults with BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 attest to the efficacy of 60 mg of orlistat, which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypothetical, fatty diet.</seg>
<seg id="2538">The primary parameter, the change in body weight compared to baseline (at the time of randomization), was evaluated as follows: a change in body weight in the course of study (Table 1) and as part of those borrowers who have lost more than 5% or more than 10% of their original weight (Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2539">Although weight loss was observed in both studies over 12 months, the biggest loss of weight occurred in the first 6 months.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The average total dietary change in the Gesamtcholesterin occurred with orlistat 60 mg -2.4% (baseline value 5.20 mmol / l) and with placebo + 2.8% (baseline: 5.26 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2541">The average dietary change in LDL cholesterol was 60 mg -3.5% (baseline value 3.30 mmol / l) and placebo + 3.8% (baseline: 3.41 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2542">The average length of the waist was -4.5 cm with orlistat 60 mg (starting value of 103.7 cm) and with placebo -3.6 cm (baseline 103.5 cm).</seg>
<seg id="2543">Plasma concentrations of non-metabolized orlistat were not measurable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg orlistat (&lt; 5 ng / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2544">7 In general, at therapeutic doses, non-metabolized orlistat in plasma could only be detected sporadically and at extremely low concentrations (&lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.02 µmol) and without signs of cumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2545">In a study of obese patients who administered the minimal systemic resorbied dose, two main metabolites, namely M1 (in position 4 hydrolyzed Lactonring) and M3 (M1 after separation of the N-formyl-leucine group), were identified, representing nearly 42% of the total plasmaize concentration.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Alopxi is used for chemotherapies which are strong triggers for nausea and vomiting (such as cisplatin), and chemotherapies which are moderate triggers for nausea and vomiting (such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin or carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The effectiveness of Aloxi can be increased by adding a corticosteroid (a drug that can be used as an antiemetic drug).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The use in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended as there is not enough information about the effects of this age group.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the active ingredient is preventing the binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5 hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin), to the receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">In three main studies, Aloxi was examined in 1 842 adults who received chemotherapies which are strong or moderate triggers for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">Chemotherapies, the strong cause of nausea and vomiting, showed 59% of patients treated with Aloxi in 24 hours after chemotherapy (132 by 223), compared to 57% of patients treated with ondansetron (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">Chemotherapies, the moderate cause of nausea and vomiting, showed 81% of patients treated with Aloxi in 24 hours after chemotherapy (153 of 189), compared to 69% of patients treated with ondansetron (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In comparison with Dolasetron these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 of 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">March 2005, the European Commission granted approval for the marketing of Aloxi in the entire European Union to the company Helsinki Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indicated in the prevention of acute nausea and vomiting in severely emetogenic chemotherapy, as a result of cancer and for the prevention of nausea and vomiting in randomly emetogenic chemotherapy, due to cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The effectiveness of Aloxi to prevent nausea and vomiting, which is induced by a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy, can be enhanced by adding a corticosteroid before chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron can prolong the colon massage, patients with anamnestian obstipation or signs of a subacute Ileus should be closely monitored after the injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">As with other 5HT3 antagonists, however, caution is advised with the simultaneous administration of palonosetron with medicines that extend the QT interval or in patients where the Qt interval is extended or which tend to such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">Apart from chemotherapy, in the days following chemotherapy, Aloxi is not to be used for prevention or treatment of nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies, Palonosetron did not inhibit the activity of the five chemotherapeutic drugs examined for tumours (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical study there was no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a one-time intravenous palonosetron and a steady state- concentration of oral metoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Pharmacokinetic analysis showed that the simultaneous administration of CYP2D6 inductors (dexamethasone and rifampicin) as well as CYP2D6 Inhibitors (Amiodarone, Doxorubicin, Fluoxetine, Ranitidine, ritonavir, Sertraline and Terbinafine) had no significant effect on the Clearance of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experiences for the use of palonosetron in human pregnancies are not available, therefore Palonosetron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the treating physician.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical trials, the most common side effects observed at a dose of 250 micrograms (a total of 633 patients), possibly associated with Aloxi, were headache (9%) and obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10.000) of hypersensitivity reactions and reactions to the location (burning, hardening, discomfort and pain) were reported in post-marketing experience reports.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage there were similar frequencies of adverse events as in the other dosage groups; there were no dose-activity relationships to be observed.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies were conducted, but due to the large distribution volume, dialysis is probably not effective in alohxi- overdosing.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies, a total of 1,132 patients receiving moderate to etogenic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of dexorubicin and 250 micrograms of palonosetron were treated with patients who received 32 mg Ondansetron (half-life: 7.3 hours), which was given day 1 without dexamethasone intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomised double-blind study, a total of 667 patients receiving a strong emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and dacarbazin and 250 or 750 micrograms of palonosetron were treated with patients who received 32 mg of ondansetron, which were given intravenously on day 1.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results from the studies of randometogenic chemotherapy and the study with strongly emetogenic chemotherapy are summarised in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials for indication of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) the effects of palonosetron were comparable to blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters including the Qtc interval with the corresponding effects of ondansetron and dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Following clinical studies, Palonosetron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in ventricular de- and repolarization and extend the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study carried out in 221 healthy volunteers was the evaluation of the ECG effects of intravenous palonosetron in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Following intravenous administration, a slow elimination of the plasma concentrations comes from the body with an average half-life of approximately 40 hours on an initial decrease in the plasma concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (CMAx) and the area under the concentration time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally dose-proportional in the entire dose range of 0.- 90 m / kg in healthy and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">Following intravenous dosage of Palonosetron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the mean (± SD) increase in the palonosetron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34% between day 1 and day 5.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Pharmacokinetic simulations indicate that at once daily intravenous administration of 0.25 mg of palonosetron was comparable to a value measured after a one-time intravenous dosage of 0.75 mg; however, the CMAX was 0.75 mg higher.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated by the kidneys and about another 50% are converted into two primary metabolites, which have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor compared to palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies on metabolism have shown CYP2D6 and, to a lesser degree, the isoenzymes CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination following an intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron, approximately 80% of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine, palonosetron as unmodified ingredient made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a one-time intravenous bolus injection, total body temperature was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal Clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Although in patients with severe liver dysfunction the terminal elimination diet and the average systemic exposure with palonosetron are increased, however, a reduction of the dose is not justified by this.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In preclinical studies, effects were observed only after expositions which are considered sufficient above the maximum human therapeutic exposure, suggesting little relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 In preclinical studies, evidence has shown that palonosetron can only block in very high concentrations of ion channels involved in ventricular de- and repolarization and extend the duration of action.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of palonosetron (each dose was expressed in approximately the 30x of the therapeutic exposure in humans), which were given daily for over two years resulted in increased incidence of liver tumors, endocrine neoplasms (in thyroid, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal marrow) and skin tumors in rats, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but because of the high dosages used and since Aloxi is determined by humans for one-time use, the relevance of these results is regarded as low for humans.</seg>

<seg id="2660">June 2006, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) approved a negative report recommended by the Alpheon 6 million IE / ml injection solution prescribed for the treatment of hepatitis C for the treatment of hepatitis C.</seg>
<seg id="2661">This means that Alpheon should resemble a biological medicinal product called Roferon-A with the same veteran ingredient that is already approved in the EU (also called "Reference for Reference for Reference for Reference for Reference for Reference for Reference for Reference for Reference for Reference for Reference for Reference."</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheleon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic (long lasting) hepatitis C (a liver disease caused by viral infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In a microscopic examination the liver tissue damage, in addition, the liver enzymes of Alanin Amino ransferase (ALT) are abnorm in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast in which a gene (DNA) was introduced, which stimulates them to form the active substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The manufacturer of Alpheon presented data showing the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (drug structure, composition and purity of the drug, effectiveness, safety and efficacy in hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study on patients with hepatitis C, the efficacy of Alpheon was compared with the efficacy of the reference drug to 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study measured how many patients responded to the drug after 12 of a total of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after the treatment was stopped (i.e. no evidence of the virus in the blood).</seg>

<seg id="2669">In addition, concerns have been expressed that data on the stability of the drug and the drug being marketed are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of patients with hepatitis C that responded to treatment with Alpheasant and Roferon-A was similar in the clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After treatment with Alpheleon, the disease was more likely to appear in more patients than with the reference drug, Alpheon has had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from this, the test used in the study was to determine the extent to which the medication triggers an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - specific proteins - against the medicine), not sufficiently validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used to treat impetigo (a skin infection with crust formation) and small infected lains (crack or cut wounds), abrasions and sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used to treat infections that have been proven or likely caused by methicillindrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alarcon may not work against this type of infections.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be used in patients at the age of nine months, but in patients under 18 years of age, the skin area to be treated should not exceed 2% of the body surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial Ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced) and thereby inhibits the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was cleared after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients under placebo matched the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected skin wounds, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: when the results of both studies were taken together at home rounds, approximately 90% of patients in both groups responded to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, it was found that Altargo was not effective enough in the treatment of abscesses (ice-filled cavities in the body tissue) or of infections caused by MRSA.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most frequent side effect with altargo (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is an irritation at the order.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Altargo outweigh the risks in the short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections: • Impetigo, • infected small infirmations, abrasions or sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Ltd. to approve Altargo in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two or three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In case of a sensitization or serious local irritation by using retapamulin ointment, the treatment is broken off, the ointment is carefully wiped and an appropriate alternative treatment of the infection is started.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retinamulin is not to be used to treat infections in which MRSA is known as pathogen or is suspected (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical trials of secondary infected open wounds the efficacy of retinamulin in patients with infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was insufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Alternative therapy should be considered if there is no improvement or deterioration of the infected spot after a 2 to 3 day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effects of the simultaneous use of retinosulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface have not been examined and the simultaneous use of other topical pharmaceuticals is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the small plasma concentrations that were achieved in humans after topical application on skuled skin or infected superficial wounds, a clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not expected (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After the simultaneous oral administration of 2 times daily 200mg of ketoconazole the mean retinamulin AUC (0-24) and CMAX increased after topical application of 1% retinamulin ointment on skuled skin of healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure after topical application in patients, dosage adjustment is not considered necessary if topical reapamulin is applied during systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive toxicity after oral ingestion and are inadequate in relation to a statement on effects on the birth and fetal / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retinamulin ointment should only be used during pregnancy if a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of retinamulin is preferable to the administration of a systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">In deciding whether breastfeeding will continue / stop or cease treatment with Altargo, it is necessary to weigh between the benefit of breastfeeding for the infant and the benefit of the Altargo therapy for woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical trials involving 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, the Altargo was the most widely reported side-effect irritation at the location, which affects approximately 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Mode of action Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pleuromutilin, a substance isolated by fermentation of clitopilus passwort tetanus (formerly Purotus passangled).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The action mechanism of retinamulin is based on selective inhibiting of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding point of the 50 s subunit of the bacterial Ribosome, which differs from the binding sites of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicates that the binding site ribosomal protein L3 is involved and lies in the region of the ribosomal P-binding site and the peptide transfer centre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">Binding on this binding site, Pleuromutiline inhibits peptide transfer, blocking partially P-binding interactions and prevents the normal formation of active 50s ribosomal subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">If the local prevalence of resistance specifies the use of retinamulin at least some types of infection, advice should be aspired by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in the in-vitro activity of retinamulin to S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of non-response to the treatment with S.aureus, the presence of trunks with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Orption In a study with healthy adults, 1% retinamulin ointment was applied daily with occlusion to intact and laced skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Of 516 patients (adults and children) who received 1% retinosulin ointment twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary-infected traumatic wounds, individual plasma samples were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">Sampling was performed on days 3 or 4 in adult patients before the medication and the children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic inclusion in humans after topical application of 1% ointment on 200 cm2 of Scracked skin (CMAX = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) 660 times lower than the retinamulin IC50 for the PGP inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The in vitro oxidative metabolism of retinosulin in human liver microsoms was primarily conveyed by CYP3A4, lower participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies of oral toxicity to rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg) carried out over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In-vitro analysis on gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in mouse-lymphoma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes as well as in rats micro-nucleus for in-vivo study of chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There was neither male nor female rats signs of reduced fertility in oral dosages of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, whereby exposure to 5 times higher exposure was achieved than the highest estimated exposure in humans (topical application on 200 cm2 of skewed skin):</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxicity study on rats at oral dosages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (according to the ≥ 3 times of estimated human exposure (see above), development oxicity (decreased body weight of fetus and delayed Ossification) and maternal toxicity were determined.</seg>
<seg id="2714">The owner of the licensing authority must ensure that a pharmacovigilance system, as presented in Module 1.8.1 of the application for authorisation (Version 6.2) is present and works before the product is marketed and as long as marketed product is applied.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children between 1 and 15 years, which are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is used as part of a two-dose vaccination plan, whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during immunization and ensures that the existing vaccination plan can be brought to an end by two doses.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refresher dose is desired against hepatitis A or B, Ambirix or other hepatitis B or B vaccine may be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines act by contributing to the immune system (the body's natural defence), as it can defend itself against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">"" "after a child has received the vaccine, the immune system detects viruses and surface antigens as" "" "foreign" "" "and produces antibodies against it." ""</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same ingredients as the vaccination approved since 1996, which has been approved since 1996 and the vaccination I have approved since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect against the same diseases, however, Twinrix adults and Twinrix are given children as part of an existing vaccination plan.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix adults contain identical ingredients, some of the data that support the application of Twinrix adults were also used as evidence for the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator of efficacy was the share of vaccinated children, who had developed a protective antibody concentration a month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study with 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six month and a 12 month gap between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix caused a month after the last injection to develop protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B, between 98 and 100% of the vaccinated children.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambiani was similar in six and a 12 month gap between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed with more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses) are headache, loss of appetite, pain at the injection point, redness, fatigue, and irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not be applied in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other ingredients or neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">In August 2002, the European Commission issued a permit to the GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals Company.</seg>
<seg id="2739">The certificate for basic immunization with Ambirix consists of two vaccines, the first dose is given at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a refresher vaccination is desired for both hepatitis A and hepatitis B, vaccination vaccine or combination vaccine may be vaccinated with the appropriate monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus are in the same size as after vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet fully assured whether immunocompetent individuals who have addressed a Hepatitis A- vaccination need a refresher vaccination as protection, since they may also be protected by immunological memory in case of no longer detectable antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all injection vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and monitoring options should always be available for the rare case of an anaphylactic reaction after vaccination.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a quick protection against hepatitis B is required, the combination vaccine is recommended with the combination vaccine that contains 360 ELISA units formalin-inactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In the case of hematalysis patients and persons with immune system disorders, there may be no adequate anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibody-value, so that in these cases the administration of further vaccines may be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since an intradermal injection or intramuscular administration could result in a suboptimal inefficacy in gluteal muscles, these injection pathways should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">In the case of thrombocytopenia or blood clotting, Ambirix can be injected subcutaneously, because in these cases the intramuscular administration can lead to bleedings.</seg>
<seg id="2748">When Ambirix was administered in the second year of life with a combined diphtheria-, tetanus, azellular pertus-, inactivated polomyelitis and Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine, the immune response was sufficient for all antigens (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients with immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immune defects it must be assumed that there may be no adequate immune response.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study conducted with 3 vaccines of this formulation in adults, the incidence of pain, redness, swelling, matchiness, gastroenteritis, headache and fever was similar to the frequency observed in the earlier thiomerisation and preservative-containing vaccine formation.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials, 2029 vaccines were administered to a total of 1027 vaccines ranging from 1 to 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study with 300 participants aged 12 to 15 years, the tolerability of Ambiani was compared to that of the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2753">Only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and fatigue on a basis of calculation per Vaccdose Ambirix, but not on a basis of calculation per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the administration of Ambirix at 50.7% of subjects, compared with 39.1% in subjects following the dose of a 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2755">After the complete vaccination, 66.4% of the subjects who received Ambirix were about pain, versus 63.8% in subjects vaccinated with the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2756">The frequency of matchiness was, however, comparable highly per proband (i.e. over the entire vaccine cycle at 39.6% of subjects who received Ambirix, compared with 36.2% in subjects who received the 3-dose combination vaccine).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency of pronounced pain and matchiness was low and comparable to those observed after the combination vaccine was observed with the 3-dose regimental diagram.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study at 1- to 11-year-old vaccines, the incidence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambirixgroup was comparable to that observed when administering with the 3-dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">In the 6- to 11-year-olds, however, after vaccination with Ambirix a more frequent occurrence of pain (at the injection point) per dose, not per proband, was reported.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The share of vaccines reported on severe side effects during the 2-dose regimen with Ambirix or during the 3-dose vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 ELISA- units and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen was not statistically different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials conducted in the age of 1 to 15 years, the serum levels of anti-HAV were 99.1% one month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second dose to be administered (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The serum levels for anti-HBs were 74.2% one month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second, to the month 6 given dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study conducted between 12- and 15-year-olds, 142 two doses of Ambirix and 147 were given the standard combination vaccine with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In the 289 people whose immunogenicity was worthless, the Seroprotectins (SP in the table below) against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 were significantly higher than with Ambirix in the month of 2 and 6 after administration of the 3-can vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The responses received in a clinical comparative study at 1- to 11-year-olds one month after completion of the full vaccination series (i.e. in month 7) are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies, the vaccines received either a 2-dose vaccination with Ambirix or a 3-dose vaccination with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">The persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies was detected at least 24 months after immunization with Ambirix in the 0-6 months vaccination.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immunological reaction observed in this study versus both antigens was comparable to that observed after vaccination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units formalininactivated Hepatitis- A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study at 12- to including 15-year-olds could be demonstrated that the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies is comparable 24 months after immunization in the 0-6 months vaccination scheme compared to the in the 0-12 months vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose of Ambirix in the second year of life was administered simultaneously with the discovery of a combined diphtheria-, tetanus, azellular pertussise-, inactivated polomyelitis and 8 Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine, the immune response was sufficient for all antigens.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the present formulation in adults showed similar seroprotectal and serum recommendations similar to previous formulation for the current formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The vaccine is to be examined both before and after the resuspening of any foreign particles and / or physically visible changes.</seg>

<seg id="2778">You can feel very tired, have a dark urine, a pale face, yellow skin and / or eyes (jaundice) and other symptoms that may make a stationary treatment necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2779">As with all vaccines, Ambirix can not protect completely from infection with Hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus, even if the complete vaccination series has been completed with 2 doses.</seg>
<seg id="2780">If you / your child is already infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus prior to the administration of both doses (even though you / your child feel unwell or sick at the time of the vaccine), vaccination may not prevent a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2781">Protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those of hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection cannot be mediated.</seg>
<seg id="2782">• If you / your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambirix or any component of this vaccine including Neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2783">An allergic reaction can manifest through itchy skin rashes, breath or swelling of your face or tongue. • If you / your child has already performed an allergic reaction to a previous vaccination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B, if you / your child has a severe infection with fever.</seg>
<seg id="2784">• If you want to have a quick protection against hepatitis B (i.e. within 6 months and prior to the scheduled administration of the second dose).</seg>
<seg id="2785">At a possible risk of hepatitis B infection between the first and second vaccination, the doctor will advise you on vaccination with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, it will recommend 3 injections of a combined hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per vaccination (360 ELISA units of a decombinant hepatitis B virus and 10 micrograms of a recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccination of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually given one month after the first dose and is likely to give you / your child a vaccination before ending the vaccine series.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes Ambirix is injected with persons suffering from severe blood clots, under the skin and not in the muscle. • If you / your child is weakened due to illness or treatment in your / her body's immunity / is or if you / your child subtract or subtract a hematalysis.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambirix can be given in these cases, but the immune response of these individuals on vaccination may not be sufficient so that a blood test may be necessary to see how strongly the response to vaccination is.</seg>
<seg id="2790">21 Tell your doctor if you / your child takes more medicine (including those that you can get without prescription) or if you / your child has been vaccinated or has been given immunoglobuline (antibodies) or has planned this in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2791">However, it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine is to be given at the same time with Ambirix, it should be vaccinated in separate areas and as different limbs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If Ambirix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immunoglobulins, it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient.</seg>

<seg id="2804">Ambirix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without needles and in packs of 50 without needles.</seg>
<seg id="2805">On the basis of the data, which have become known since the issuance of the first permit for placing on the market, the CHMP assumed that the benefit-risk ratio for Ambiani remains positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since Ambirix was only placed in a Member State (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this medicine is limited due to the low patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonia can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with incomplete enzyme defect or with hyperammonium endemic encephalopathy (brain damage as a result of high ammonia concentrations) in the prehistory.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonia is distributed - divided into several single doses at meals - swallowed, mixed into food or administered via a gastrostomieslauch (through the abdominal wall into the stomach leading tube) or a nasal probe (through the nose into the stomach leading tube).</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was not a comparative study, because Ammontaps could not be compared with another treatment or placebo (a placebo (i.e. without active ingredient).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammontaps can also lead to loss of appetite, abnormal levels of acid in the blood, depression, irritability, headache, fainting, fluid retention, stomach pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, rash, unpleasant body odor or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that ammonia was effectively prevented from high ammonia levels in patients suffering from disorders of the urea cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2812">Ammonia was approved under "exceptional circumstances" because of the rarity of the disease at the time of admission only limited information on this medicine was available.</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indicated in all patients with a complete enzyme shortage already manifested in newborns (within the first 28 days of life).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late-manifest form (incomplete enzyme defect, which manifests itself after the first life month) there is an indication for the use if hyperammonia encephalopathy in the anamnesis exists.</seg>
<seg id="2815">AMMONAPS is also available in granular form for infants, for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with swallowing disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is calculated individually, taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake needed for growth and development.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experiences, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of more than 20 kg, as well as in adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">For patients suffering from an early manifest lack of carbamethphosphate synthetase or orniintranscarbamylase, the substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with arginine uccinate synthetase deficiency must receive arginine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be given to patients with swallowing disorders, as there is a risk for the formation of esophagus ulcera when the tablets do not immediately enter the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrat, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore be used only with caution in patients with congestive heart failure or severe renal insufficiency as well as with sodium retention and estrogen production.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Since metabolism and excretion of sodium phenylbutyrat are carried out via the liver and kidneys, AMMONAPS should be used only with extreme caution in patients with liver or renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The significance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">Subcutaneous administration of phenylacetate to young rats at high dosage (190 - 474 mg / kg) resulted in slowing neuronal proliferation and increased neuron loss.</seg>
<seg id="2826">There was also a delayed maturation of cerebral synapses and a reduced number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a hindrance to brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be ascertained whether phenylacetate is excreted by humans into the mother's milk, and for this reason the use of AMMONAPS is contraindicated during breastfeeding (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS, 56% of patients had at least an adverse event (AE) and 78% of these adverse events was assumed that they were not associated with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very frequently (≥ 1 / 10), frequently (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1.000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an anomalous 18-year-old anorectal disease, which developed a metabolic encephalopathy in combination with lactazidosis, severe hypokalemia, tank topenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">An overdose case occurred at a 5 month old infant with an accidental total dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms proceed with the accumulation of phenylacetate, which showed a dose-limiting neurotoxicity in intravenous doses up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolic active compound which is conjugated by acetylacetylglutamine, which is excreted via the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to phenylacetylglutamine (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for excretion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 Patients with disorders of the urea cycle can be assumed that sodium phenylbutyrate is produced for every gram between 0.12 and 0.15 g of phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival and clinical outcome.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the appearance of the first symptoms in newborns was almost always infaust, and the disease itself led to death even in the treatment with peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen-free analoga in the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">Haemodialysis, the utilization of alternative methods of nitrophenylbutyrate, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate), protein-reduced food and possibly substitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of newborns in postpartal (but within the first life month) diagnosed diseases to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">Patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of the pregnancy and which were already treated before the first appearance of a hyperammonia encephalopathy, the survival rate was 100%, but even with these patients it came with time with many to mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late-manifest form of the disease (including female patients with the heterozygotes form of the orniintranscarbamylase deficiency), which recovered from hyperammonia encephalopathy and treated permanently with sodium phenylbutyrat and a protein-reduced diet, the survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible and in some patients a further worsening of the neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">Phenylbutyrat is oxidized to phenylacetate, which is conjugated to glutamine in the liver and kidneys, with phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites in plasma and urine were determined after administration of a single dose of 5 g. of sodium phenylbutyrat for sober healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, hemoglobin metabolism, and repeated doses of oral doses of up to 20 g / day (uncontrolled studies).</seg>
<seg id="2844">Phenylbutyrat and its metabolites were also studied in cancer patients following intravenous administration of sodium phenylbutyrat (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral dose of 5 g. of sodium phenylbutyrat in tablet form 15 minutes after intake, measurable plasma concentrations were determined by phenylbutyrat.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with urea disease or hemoglobin, phenylbutyrat (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) could not be phenylacetate in the next morning after nightly fasting.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three out of six patients with cirrhosis of the liver, treated repeatedly with sodium phenylbutyrat (20 g / day orally in three single doses) the mean phenylacetate concentrations in the plasma gas label were five times higher on the third day than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Excretion The drug is excreted within 24 hours to about 80 - 100% in the form of the conjugated product phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the Micronucleus tests, NSC 631570 treated with toxic and non-toxic dosages treated rats with no endocrine effects (examination 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS Granules are either taken orally (babies and children who can't swallow tablets, or patients with hiccups) or via a gastrostomieskin or a nasal probe.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to previous clinical experiences, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with newborns, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of more than 20 kg, as well as in adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched-chain amino acids), carnitine and serum protein in the plasma should be kept within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">For patients suffering from an early manifest lack of carbamethphosphate synthetase or orniintranscarbamylase, the substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS granulate contains 124 mg (5.4 mmol) sodium per gram of sodium diphenylbutyrat, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrat, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">When rat flutes were exposed before the birth of phenylacetate (active metabolism of phenylbutyrat), lesions in the pyramidal cells of the cerebral cortex occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an anomalous 18-year-old anorectal disease, which developed a metabolic encephalopathy in combination with lactazidosis, severe hypokalemia, tank topenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to phenylacetylglutamine (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for excretion of excess</seg>
<seg id="2858">Based on investigations on the excretion of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, phenylacetylbutyrat can be produced between 0.12 and 0.15 g of phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible for treatment, and in some patients a further worsening of the neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After an oral dose of 5 g. of sodium phenylbutyrat in granular form 15 minutes after intake, measurable plasma concentrations were determined by phenylbutyrat.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During the period of durability, the patient can keep the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of no more than 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">In this procedure, the small measuring spoon contains 0.95 g, the mean measuring spoon 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.6 g sodium phenylbutyrat.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient has to receive the medicine above a probe, AMMONAPS can also be dissolved in water before use (the solubility of sodium phenylbutyrat amounts to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases, certain liver enzymes are missing so that they cannot excrete the nitrogenous waste products that accumulate in the body after eating proteins.</seg>
<seg id="2865">If laboratory tests are carried out, you must inform the doctor that you are taking AMMONAPS since sodium phenylbutyrat may affect the results of certain laboratory tests.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is used to treat adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS, reduced blood supply to the heart), for example in unstable angina (a form of pain in the thorax with different starch) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) without "stress" (an anomalous measured value in electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients undergoing a PCI, a higher dose is administered and the infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help patients with angina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Nearly 14,000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS, in which the effect of angiox was compared with sole administration or in conjunction with a glycoprotein-IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, another drug for preventing blood clots) compared to conventional combination therapy with Heparin (another anticoagulant) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI, the patient often became a stent (a short tube left in the artery to prevent a shutter) and additionally received other medicines to prevent blood clots, such as Abciximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS, Angiox - with or without the use of GPI - was effective in preventing new events (deaths, heart attacks or revascularization) after 30 days or a year altogether as effective as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients undergoing a PCI, Angiox was as effective as Heparin in relation to all indicators, except for severe bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to bivalirudin, other brain pudine or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It may not be used in patients who recently had a bleeding, as well as people with severe high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or heart infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that Angiox during the treatment of ACS and during a PCI is an acceptable replacement for Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission issued a permit to the Medicines Company UK Ltd to approve the launch of Angiox in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina / non-ST-uplift infarction (IA / NSTEMI)) in case of emergencies or early intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initial dose of angiox in patients with ACS is an intravenous bolus of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If a PCI is additionally carried out for the patient, an additional bolus of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the infusion for the duration of the surgery is increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">According to the PCI, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours after clinical needs.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Immediately before the procedure a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of Angiox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intravenous bolt of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and an immediate intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of any bolus administration of Angiox has not been examined and is not recommended even if a short PCI operation is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened to less than 225 seconds, a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should be achieved.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values, the reconstituted and diluted pharmaceuticals should be carefully mixed before application and the bolus dose should be administered intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">As soon as the ACT is more than 225 seconds, further monitoring is no longer required, provided that the 1,75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">For patients with severe kidney function restriction (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which are subjected to a PCI (whether treated with Bivalirudin vs. ACS or not), a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT is less than 225 seconds, a second bolt of 0,3 mg / kg must be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dose is checked again.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with severe kidney damage which were included in the Phase II PCI Study (REPLACE-2), which resulted in admission, the ACT is 5 minutes after administration of the Bivalirudin-Bolus with no dose adaptation at an average of 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 In patients with severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and also in dialysis patients angiox is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">Treatment with Angiox can be initiated 30 minutes after completion of IV administration of unfractionated Heparin or 8 hours after the subcutaneous administration of low molecular heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2905">• serious hypersensitivity to active substance or other constituents or against brain udine • active haemorrhasis and / or irreversible clotting disorders. • severe uncontrolled hypertension and subacute bacterial endocarditis. • severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and in dialysis patients</seg>
<seg id="2906">Patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding, especially if bivalirudin is administered in combination with another anticoagulant (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even though most bleeding in arterial points occur in PCI patients under Bivalirudin, patients who undergo a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) can occur in principle throughout bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients who are taking Warfarin and treated with Bivaliruine, a monitoring of the INR (International Regular Ratio) should be considered to ensure that the value after the treatment with Bivalirudin returns the level before the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">From the knowledge of the mechanisms of action of anticoagulants (Heparin, Warfarin, Thrombolytics or thrombocyte aggregate), it can be assumed that these agents increase the risk of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2910">The combination of bivalirudin with thrombocyte aggregations or anticoagulants is the clinical and biological hemostaseology parameters in each case to be monitored regularly.</seg>
<seg id="2911">In relation to effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, disconnection or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2912">4612 were randomised to Bivalirudin alone, 4604 were randomized to Bivalirudin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor and 4603 were randomized to either unfractionated Heparin or Enoxaparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2913">In both the bivalent group and the groups treated with Heparin, women and patients over the age of 65 were more likely to have adverse events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Severe bleeding has been defined in accordance with ACUITY and Timi standards for severe hemorrhages as defined in table 2 footnotes.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both light and severe bleeding occurred under Bivalirudin alone significantly less frequently than in groups with Heparin plus GPIIb / III- Inhibitor plus GPIIb / III- Inhibitor (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">An ACUITY heavy bleeding was defined as one of the following events: intracranial, retroperitoneal, intraocular bleeding or bleeding in the point area, reduction of haemoglobin levels of ≥ 3 g / dl with known blood cell, reoperation due to bleeding, application of blood products for transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Other, less frequently observed blood localizations, which occurred at more than 0.1% (occasionally), were "other" point positions, retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, ear, nose or throat.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following information about side effects is based on data from a clinical trial with Bivalirudin in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2919">In both the Bivalirudin Group and the groups treated with Heparin, women and patients over 65 years were more likely to have adverse events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less among bivaliruine than in the comparison group under Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>

<seg id="2922">In case of overdose, the treatment with Bivalirudin is to be stopped immediately and the patient is close meshed with regard to signs of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains bivalirudin, a direct and specific aroma inhibitor that binds both the catalytic centre and the anion binding region of Thrombin, regardless of whether it is trapped in the liquid phase or clotting.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The Binding of Bivalirudin to Thrombin, and with it its effect, is reversible, because Thrombin is slowly splitting up the bond of Bivalirudin-ARG3-Pro4, which regenerates the function of the active centre of Thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, it was not possible to induce a thrombocytopenie / heparininduciated thrombocytopenie / heparininduciated thrombocytopenie / heparininduciated thrombocytopenia / heparininduciated thrombocytopenia / heparininducized thrombocytopenia (HIT / HITTS).</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy volunteers and in patients, Bivalirudin shows a dose and concentration-dependent anticoagulatory effect that is demonstrated by the extension of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">If a PCI was subsequently carried out below, an additional bolt of 0.5mg / kg Bivalirudin was to be given and the infusion for the duration of the surgery is increased to 1.75mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2928">In arm A of the ACUVC study unfractional Heparin or Enoxaparin was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients with unstable angina / non-ST-uplift infarction (IA / NSTEMI).</seg>
<seg id="2929">Patients in Arm A and B were also randomized to obtain a GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor prior to angiography (at the time of randomization) or with the PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2930">In the ACUVC study, the characteristics of high-risk patients who required angiography in 72 hours were spread evenly over the 3 arms.</seg>
<seg id="2931">About 77% of patients had a recurring ischemia, 70% had dynamic EKG changes or increased cardiac biomarkers, 28% had diabetes and about 99% of all patients underwent angiography within 72 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2932">The primary analysis and results from the ACUVC study for the 30-day and 1 year endpoint for the overall population (ITT) and for the patients who received aspirin and Clopideurel according to protocol (before angiography or before PCI) are presented in tables 7 and 8.</seg>

<seg id="2935">The frequency of bleeding in both ACUITY- and Timi levels up to day 30 for the overall population (ITT) and for patients who received aspirin and Clopideurel according to protocol is shown in Table 9.</seg>
<seg id="2936">According to protocol UFH / Enox Bival Bival + + alone + + GPIIb / IIIa (N = 4612) GPIIb / IIIa (N = 4603) (N = 4603) (N = 4604) (N = 4604) (N = 4604) (N = 2842)%%%%</seg>
<seg id="2937">* Clopivotrel before angiography or before PCI 1 A ACUITY heavy bleeding was defined as one of the following events: intracranial, retroperito-neal, intraocular bleeding or bleeding in the point area, reduction of haemoglobin levels of ≥ 3 g / dl with known blood cell, reoperation due to bleeding, application of blood products for transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The 30-day results, based on quadruple and triple endpoints of a randomised double blind study with more than 6,000 patients undergoing a PCI (REPLACE-2), are shown in Table 10.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Clinical trials with a small number of patients provided limited information on the application of angiox in patients with HIT / HITTS.</seg>
<seg id="2940">The pharmacokinetic properties of Bivalirudin were evaluated in patients subjected to a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and in patients with ACS.</seg>
<seg id="2941">It is expected that Bivalirudin is running a catabolism in its amino acid components with subsequent revaluation of amino acids in the body pool.</seg>
<seg id="2942">The primary metabolism resulting from the split of the ARG3-Pro4 binding of the N-terminal sequence through thrombin is not effective because of the loss of its affinity to the catalytic center of thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2943">The elimination is done in patients with normal renal function after a first order process with a terminal half-life of 25 ± 12 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Based on conventional safety harmacology studies, toxicity in repeated dose, genotoxicity or reproductive toxicity, preclinical data does not reveal any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="2945">The toxicity in animals with repeated or continuous exposure (1 day to 4 weeks at exposure to 10-fades of the clinical Steady-state plasma concentration) was limited to overshooting pharmacological effects.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Adverse reactions due to a longer-term physiological strain in response to non-homeostatic coagulation were not observed after short-term exposure to those in clinical use, even at very high dosages.</seg>
<seg id="2947">If the manufacture of ready-to-use solution is not performed under controlled and validated aseptic conditions, it is no longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2948">Angiox is a freeze-dried powder in single-dose injection bottles of type 1 glass to 10 ml, sealed with a butyl rubber stopper and sealed with a cap made of pressed aluminium.</seg>
<seg id="2949">5 ml sterile water for injection purposes are put into a bottle of Sangiox and gently swivelled until everything has completely dissolved and the solution is clear.</seg>
<seg id="2950">5 ml are removed from the flow bottle and diluted with 5% glucose solution for injection or with 9 mg / ml (0.9%) sodium chloride solution for injection in a total volume of 50 ml to obtain a final concentration of 5mg / ml of Bivalirudin.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children over the age of six with diabetes who need insulin treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is administered subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, thigh or upper arm or administered as permanent infusion with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate the glucose level (sugar) in the blood or the insulin is unable to work effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin Csin differs very slightly from human insulin, and the change means it works faster and has a shorter active lifetime than a short-acting acting insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was used in combination with a long-term insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study involving 572 children aged four to 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In type 2 diabetes, where insulin is unable to work effectively, Apidra has been studied in a study of 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood which indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes, a decrease of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was observed after six months compared to a decrease of 0.14% in insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes the lowering of HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0.30% in human normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin stimulant or any of the other ingredients, or in patients who already suffer from hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra may have to be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other drugs that may affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission granted Sanofi-Aventis Germany GmbH a licence for placing Apidra in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra is used as a subcutaneous injection either in the area of the abdominal wall, thigh or the delta muscle or subcutaneous by continuous infusion in the area of the abdominal cavity.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the reduced gluconogenesis capacity and the reduced insulin metabolism, the insulin requirement in patients with a restriction of the liver function can be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change of the active strength, the brand (producer), the insulin type (normal, NPH, zinc-retarded etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the manufacturing method can change the insulin requirement.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 An inadequate dosing or breakdown of a treatment, especially in patients with insulin-based diabetes, may result in hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis. these conditions are potentially life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">Switching from one patient to another insulin type or an insulin belonging to another manufacturer should be carried out under strict medical supervision and can necessitate a change in dosing.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of hypoglycaemia occurrence depends on the mode of activity of the insulin used and can therefore change when the treatment scheme is changed.</seg>
<seg id="2983">Substances that increase blood sugar lowering activity and increase the inclination to hypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylates, propoxyphene, salizylates and sulfonamide antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, under the effects of sympatholytics like beta blockers, Clonidin, Guanthidin and reserves the symptoms of the adrenergic antiregulation can be weakened or missing.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Experimental studies on reproductive toxicity showed no differences between insu- ling.lisin and human insulin regarding pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin delivery occurs in human breast milk, but in general, insulin is not absorbed into breast milk, nor is it resorbed to oral use.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Following the list of undesirable drugs known from clinical trials, grouped by system organclasses and ordered by decreasing frequency of their occurrence (very common: ≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100; rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10.000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10.000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10.000; rare: ≥ 1 / 10; rare: ≥ 1 / 10; rarely estimated (frequency based on the data available).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold - wellia, cool and pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremors, anxiety, unusual exhaustion or weakness, confusion, lack of concentration, lightheadedness, excessive dog, headache, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Podystrophy Achipped to continuously change the injection point within the injection unit, a lipodystrophy may occur at the injection point.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycemias with unconsciousness can be treated by an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg), given by a suitably trained person or treated by intravenous doses of glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After an injection of glucose, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of severe hypoglycemia and avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose absorption (especially skeletal muscle and fat) as well as by inhibition of glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that at subcutaneous ga- be of insulin-pleasers the effect occurs more quickly and the duration is shorter than with hu- manem normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study with 18 male individuals aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes, insulin sensitivity in the therapeutically relevant dosing range of 0.075 to 0.15 E / kg showed a dose of proportionate glucosm lowering effect, and at 0.3 E / kg or more a disproportionate increase in the glucosm lowering effect, just like human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin Csin has a twice as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves the complete glucossing effect approximately 2 hours earlier than Human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">From the data it was obvious that in an application of insulin-lulisin 2 minutes before the meal a comparable post-prandial glycaemic control is reached, such as with human insulin analog, which is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">If insulin assimilation was acquired 2 minutes before the meal, a better postprandial control was achieved than with human insulin analog, which was given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin is turned 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal, a comparative glycaemic control is achieved, such as the human insulin analog, which is given 2 mids before the meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin delivery in gift 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before) before the start of the meal compared to human common insulin, which was given 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 min) before the meal begins (figure 1A) before a meal was given (Figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin stimulant in administration 15 minutes (afterwards) after the beginning of the meal compared to human tin-insulin analog, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before the beginning of the meal (Figure 1C).</seg>
