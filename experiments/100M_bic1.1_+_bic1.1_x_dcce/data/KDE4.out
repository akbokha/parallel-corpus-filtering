if a part of the text is selected , only this part will be translated at the place of the entire &amp; URL .
machine translations are only very ru@@ di@@ mentary . bab@@ el@@ fish produces in the best case a rough translation and in the worst case non@@ sense . therefore , you should not make any important decisions on the translations , without checking the translation beforehand .
only websites on the internet can be translated . other texts should be translated at the Bab@@ el@@ fish page itself , where you can paste text into translated texts directly .
the package includes various modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite their small size , they offer some additional features and simplify the use of some functions of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making them easier available .
for more information on the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , and the built @-@ in functions , consult &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or .
to load these modules in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select configuration extensions ... Open the map tools and select the desired modules there .
this is a list of standard modules from the box k@@ de ; add@@ ons . please note that there may be more modules on your system if you have additional software installed .
you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; contains before comp@@ iling this package .
to use the crash module , click on the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; on Tools Deg@@ re@@ es . then you can view the page that has brought &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , or the list of crashes , if any , delete .
the p@@ age@@ filter module ( also called folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras An@@ gle Filter . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s current working directory in different ways .
to use the DO@@ M tree view in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , choose Extras DO@@ M Tree ... and open a new window with DO@@ M of the currently displayed web page . as default , the document begins with the root node of the document , for example : documentary element , all other nodes are sub@@ elements of this root node .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides another view for objects with the MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory on local files . it can be used as an alternative to the different symbol and text views , in order to view the contents of your local file system .
the peculi@@ arity of &amp; FS@@ View ; is to display ne@@ sted folder hierarch@@ ies using a Tree @-@ Map . tree maps allow the representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rec@@ tangle whose surface is proportional to its size . this size must possess the property that the sum of the size of the subordin@@ ate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
for &amp; FS@@ View , the size of a file or folder shows the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files can be easily recognized , even if it is located far down in the folder hierarchy . accordingly , &amp; FS@@ View can be seen as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; -@@ command you are viewing .
in &amp; FS@@ View ; an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap display is a rec@@ tangle representing a file or folder in your file system . for easier navigation , the rectang@@ les have meaningful color and labelling settings .
the color of a rec@@ tangle that is switched between view color mode can either represent depth for the light detection of the ne@@ sting depth or the illustration of another file property such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type .
a rec@@ tangle can be labeled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder . for each property , you can specify whether or not it is displayed at all , only if there is enough space to display or whether the area should appear in the symbol of the Tre@@ em@@ ap . furthermore , you can specify the relative position of the let@@ tering in the rec@@ tangle .
for Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View , this objective is not always maintained . frames are drawn to represent the ne@@ sting of the entries , and this setting requires space , which is no longer available to the subordin@@ ate entries . note that less space is lost for the frame when the rec@@ tangle is square .
how to divide the area of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries is left to the implementation . here it is always advantageous for inscription and avoid@@ ance of space losses through frame always to divide the areas so that rectang@@ les are possible , which are as square as possible . the best methods in this regard are rows , columns or recur@@ sive branches .
you can specify the minimum displayed area for an entry above the menu entry view on area . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry .
originally it was &amp; FS@@ View ; intended as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ get developed for the K@@ C@@ ach@@ anlage application .
the Picture Gallery can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras Image Gallery ... or by C@@ trl ; I .
when you access the Picture Gallery , a dialog opens , which allows you to specify the appearance of the gallery .
the title of the page allows you to adjust the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field .
the images per line option has a scroll bar and a turning field to set the number of thumb@@ nails in each line in the gallery .
in the File Name box , specify whether the file names are displayed among the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
with the check@@ box file size of the image , specify whether the file size is displayed among the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
with the image size check box specify whether the size of the images is shown in the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
in the dialog folder , specify where the gallery is stored and which sub@@ folders are to be included .
in the file selection save into HTML file , specify where to save the HTML page .
with the check box , you can set the sub@@ folder to which level the sub@@ folders will be included .

an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided for you to connect with your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ cam ; albums can be downloaded by means of the library g@@ Photo@@ 2 . of course , every medium and every card reader that is supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ cam ; work together .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; contains a fast image processing with basic image editing tools . you can use it to view , comment , evaluate and correct your photos . the processing capabilities can be easily expanded with K@@ DE Image plug @-@ ins interface ( manual ) modules .
although &amp; digi@@ kam ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional skills . it works completely in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion using li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG export and ICC color management workflow .
improved database with considerably more metadata such as &amp; eg ; through the camera or the lens to search for .
like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs are also digi@@ ti@@ sed ; an open source project . that means it depends on the support of the end users . therefore , you should report problems and improvement opportunities .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; tries to make the reporting of problems or suggestions as easy as possible for them . wherever you are in the program , the Help menu contains an entry problems or wishes . if you use this link , your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system . all required information is already entered here . just follow the instructions to send your report .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; is a project supported by a community . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ cam ; if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ cam ; then we would like to ask you to answer questions to other users of &amp; digi@@ cam ; however , in this mailing list English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful in this language .
you can also visit the digi@@ cam ; visit homepage to learn news about released versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ cam ; to learn .
the best start to get to &amp; digi@@ cam ; to participate , registration is in the developer mailing list . instructions for noti@@ fying in the developer mailing list by &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
when you start &amp; digi@@ cam ; for the first time , you will be asked where you want to save your images and your database . you can enter a local , remote or remote folder here . simply enter the path name or click the Fol@@ der icon Fol@@ der icon to select a folder .
in the second field , you will need to specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data storage will be stored . this path will remain the same for all image folders .
later you can add as many folders as you want . &amp; digi@@ cam ; it will additionally use as an al@@ bian library . setup digi@@ code set up collections
if you already have a picture collection on your hard drive , you can specify the top folder that contains images as the base folder . &amp; digi@@ cam ; looks at every sub@@ folder as an album . no picture will be changed .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; Dur@@ ns recur@@ sively the library path in all its depth . you cannot exclude sub@@ folders , unless it i@@ ste in hidden folders . you can do exceptional &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed by inser@@ ting a dot in front of the sub@@ folder name .
if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ List will not have any photos as symbols . you can change them by taking any photo from the album and using it on the folder icon .
once you have configured the base folder , you can be edited in &amp; digi@@ cam ; set up your digital camera . then you should learn how to use My Albums and My keyword list to manage your photos in the albums .
raw file support : if you use the raw version of your camera , it can be digi@@ ti@@ zed , possibly b@@ yp@@ assing it . support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported shell cameras in the Help menu support .
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the Ro@@ h decoder settings and raw workflow sequences .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided for you to connect with your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ cam ; albums can be downloaded by means of the library g@@ Photo@@ 2 . of course , every medium and every card reader that is supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ cam ; work together .
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . the camera then appears as a disk drive . the camera can also be accessed via Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deri@@ vatives .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; uses the g@@ Photo@@ 2 program to communicate with digital camera . g@@ Photo@@ 2 is a free , distributed software collection for digital cameras which has been developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need for additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for communicating with the computer . since photos are generally large files and trans@@ missions via serial port are slow , this connection is now out@@ dated . &amp; digi@@ cam ; supports these cameras and performs the transmission of images using g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found at this link .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 has been created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support to reliably read digital thumb@@ nails . Ex@@ if support is needed by some lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 camera operators to read the preview images . if the Ex@@ if support is not present in lib@@ g@@ Photo@@ 2 , you might not be able to see thumb@@ nails or the generation could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things in &amp; digi@@ cam ; is how easy it is to extend its functionality by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image plug @-@ in interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ cam ; to provide K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ d@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the aim is to provide the modules to all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in almost every way , as also a user can . their advantage is that it is significantly easier to add a function , by writing a small module , when the changes in &amp; digi@@ kam ; even perform .
to simplify the window , you can either remove the page strips with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full@@ screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ trl + Shift + F .
drag and drop pictures works everywhere : you can take a picture in another part of the al@@ bian tree , above the horizontal dividing line or into another application window . the only limitation is that a picture can not be stored in keywords , data list or search .
- a file type selection allows you to highlight the most common : JPEG , PNG , TIFF , Ro@@ h , Mo@@ vies and Audio
the text filter is only used for the fields displayed in the toolbar at the moment . thus filtering on the file name only works if the screen is also displayed . which fields are displayed can be configured in the Al@@ ben@@ Setup dialog .
the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view of your photo albums . all photos that were edited by &amp; digi@@ cam are stored in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted according to the folders in which they were recorded on the hard disk , after the name of their collection in the album properties or after the date on which the album was created first . the date can be changed in the characteristics of the album .
if you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . just select Import Pictures from the album . you can also add a screen@@ shot directly to an album .
in order to copy or move an image from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse over the target album and drop it there . in the pop @-@ up menu you have to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . simply select all the photos and move them to the target album .
an album contains a collection of photos and the album properties allow you to enter information about this collection . in order to access the album properties , you have to click with the right mouse button on the album and edit the album properties in the pop @-@ up menu .
album collections : are a method to highlight your albums so that you can group together under a common name . the collection you set will be used to sort your photos , if you want to add or delete new collections by collection . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do so in the collections for collections .
the Album Date : used when you sort your albums by date with View albums Up date .
the buttons elder , average , new : they set the date on that of the oldest , the newest picture or that of the average of the album . this will first attempt to calculate the average of images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of the last change of each file in this folder will be used instead .
when you first recorded an album in &amp; digi@@ cam ; open , the first image in the album is selected as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; this will help you to remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as an album icon , click the image with the right mouse button and in the context menu &amp; quot ; When album preview wr@@ oth ; select . additionally , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
an album can only be included in a collection and collections cannot be ne@@ sted .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; supports the entry of keywords for individual photos in the My keyword list at the bottom left of the main window . album collections have a different effect . the collection always includes all photos of the album .
the picture window will provide you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all the images in this album will be shown in the picture window . each photo is displayed in a preview , you can customize the size of these preview using the two magni@@ fier buttons in the toolbar .
when you open an album the first time , you have to wait short while the thumb@@ nails will be generated . this can be avoided by recre@@ ating all thumb@@ nails from the Tools menu .
information on each image is displayed below the thumb@@ nail . what information this is , you can change the digi@@ ti@@ sed settings ; set up the albums page and customize the range preview images according to your wishes .
the thumb@@ nails have help windows that appear . if you let the mouse @-@ cursor take a moment over a picture . the help shows the most important features including all keywords of a photo . the screen@@ shot above in the introduction to the main window shows such a help window .
photos are all about digi@@ ti@@ sing ; albums and keywords allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you . image Edi@@ ting displays your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to them . you can choose any of the features that have been edited with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed . you can choose between viewing the images , a slideshow or editing the images .
you can open the image processing with a photo by selecting either F@@ 4 Picture Edit ... or selecting the context menu of the image with the right mouse button , and editing ... you will find instructions on how to edit your photos . image Edi@@ ting lets you view and edit your photos .
it can happen that &amp; digi@@ cam ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the sub@@ menu of opening . for this , and how to customize it to your needs , if your program is not listed , you will find information in the &amp; k@@ de ; manual .
you should note that after editing , there may be problems with the metadata contained in the image after editing . some programs do not store this data when you save the changed image . thus , this information is lost from the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aperture etc .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; provides two options for turning . the simplest one is to click with the right mouse button on the preview and select rotation . in the sub @-@ menu you can indicate the degree of rotation .
to change the filen@@ ame of a photo , right click on the preview and select F@@ 2 ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you retain the extension ( .@@ jp@@ g , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) .
if you delete a photo from &amp; digi@@ cam ; delete it , it will be moved in the garbage bin@@ s of &amp; k@@ de ; move . F@@ 8 image delete or Del Falls you prefer to delete , you can use this by using Shift ; Del .
the View &amp; quot ; My Dat@@ um@@ sli@@ p@@ quot ; organizes your photos based on the data . &amp; digi@@ cam ; uses either the EX@@ IF date or , if it is not available , the date of last modification of the file .
if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be displayed in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the data sheet at the bottom of the calendar view , so that only the photos of the selected days will be displayed .
keywords are provided with a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos . keywords are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups . once a keyword has been assigned a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search .
if a keyword is selected , all the photos marked with this keyword will be shown .
keywords can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . by doing this , you can lo@@ gically organize your keywords . you can also fold parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ wor@@ li@@ pi@@ quot ; so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for .
the keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG . you can also re @-@ import your keywords in other programs .
you can add new keywords by right @-@ clicking either on &amp; quot ; My keyword or click on an existing keyword and then select New C@@ ue . if you have cli@@ cked on an existing keyword , this keyword will be used for sub@@ stit@@ uting this keyword .
you can delete a keyword by clicking the keyword with the right mouse button and select Del@@ ete . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the keyword will be removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a keyword by drag@@ ging it to the desired position in the tree and drop it there . then a menu appears that gives you the option to post@@ p@@ one the keyword . a keyword can only be in the tree at a time .
you can change the properties of a keyword by clicking it with the right mouse button and selecting the keywords in the context menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword .
to select another photo as an album icon , click the image with the right mouse button and select it as album preview . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
to use keywords , you must first add your photos with keywords . this can be done in two ways : as soon as you select the photos that you want to put with a keyword , you can drag them to the corresponding keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword quot ; drag and drop them . alternatively , you can click with the right mouse button on the preview of the pictures and select from the context menu keyword .
you can tag a photo with any number of keywords . the photo is displayed as soon as you select one of the keywords assigned to it . in this way , you can assign a keyword for each person on a photo , one for the place in which the photo was made , one for the event where it was made etc .
once you have provided a photo with keywords , this will be shown in the main window by previ@@ ewing the image .
you can remove a keyword in which you right click on the photo &apos;s context menu and select Rem@@ ove from the menu menu . the menu only shows the keywords that have been assigned to the photo .
the tim@@ eline view displays a time @-@ dependent hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be moved through this hist@@ ogram . to select a tim@@ ef@@ r@@ ame you only have to click on the lower rec@@ tangle of the selection frame that displays the time unit . this will display all associated images in the main window .
in the bottom field you can enter a title and save your selection . it will appear in the list below .
include all elements of the database : names , ratings , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and in the future even more .
when you click here , the filter will be deleted and all images will be displayed again . if the search has not found anything , then the lamp will be red .
the more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side@@ bar with bin@@ oc@@ ulars . if you open this you get a simple search box as described above . you can save this search here as a live search , which always filtered out what you entered as search criterion . after you have saved it , it appears in the list .
when you are satisfied with your selection , press the OK button and the search will be performed . the text box Save As is used to add a name to my search list to your request . if you want to change your selection once again , you only need to select the appropriate entry from the View My Search list and select an option in its context menu .
if you select to edit searches the form will appear again with the search information previously entered . if you choose to edit as advanced search , the dialog will appear for the advanced search to change your previous search . you will find more information in the section The Advanced Search Tool .
if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select Clear in the pop @-@ up menu .
the Advanced search gives you an advanced search form with many search parameters , with which you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ cam ; s database .
the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the al@@ bian database . any option can be added to the search group / added by operators . each option can be added with other search group / search group . additionally , you can link search of type &amp; quot ; AND NI@@ CH@@ T@@ quot ; .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; characterized by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . it allows to compare images by comparing these sig@@ natures . the smaller the difference between two sig@@ natures , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is an area where you can drop every picture to find a similar one . by using a sw@@ ell@@ ings , the result selection can be enlarged or reduced . if you push a picture from somewhere over the symbol of in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar then it will open and you can drop it there .
sketch : hand @-@ handed colour sketch : draw a quick sketch and &amp; digi@@ cam ; find the right pictures . also here can be set a threshold .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can move in or out or hold it on the mouse wheel . press C@@ trl ; left mouse button to move around a square . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . of course , this assumes your images contain Ge@@ o data .
in the bottom field , you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter , which will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a Live Geo@@ file .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; provides a light table in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , also raw files , together .
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ trl ; L D@@ em Ligh@@ table added from the context menu . the selection will be added to the illuminated table and its window opened . if you are back in &amp; digi@@ cam ; main window , you can quickly open the illuminated table with L Extras illuminated .
from the preview window you can drag the images you want to compare in the left or right pane of the window and drop them there . a small arrow shows you which copy in which window area is to be seen .
another mode is better suited to quickly sort out from a series of images . if you use combination mode to navigate from the toolbar , then the two first images will automatically be loaded into the same area . the right @-@ hand side image will be displayed in the right pane . this simpli@@ fies it through a series of similar images .
of course , the normal deletion operations also work directly from the light table such as F@@ 4 file editing ....
all image information from the right side bar of the main window is available for both thumb@@ nails in the light table . for example , this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
at the bottom of each area you will find a built @-@ in til@@ ting function , which you can see on the crossed arrows . to pi@@ v@@ ot the visible area of the image , you need to click them and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; hold down . in the preview mode , both images will display the same image area .
just use the zoom slider under the images or C@@ trl ; scroll wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out . this happens in both images when you preview in the preview mode .
what is a digital stock management - away from the fashion word ? digital stock management considers every part of the process followed after the image has been taken up to final output and permanent storage . each of the photos records , scans or digital photos saves a form of digital stock management . however , most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips how to back up , find , protect and reuse photos . we will focus on the procedures for digital photographers that &amp; digi@@ kam ; we will focus on downloading , ren@@ aming , converting , group@@ ing , backing , sorting , sorting , waiting and ex@@ porting image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital Stock Manager records , index@@ ed , categ@@ orized , sec@@ ures , searches , compil@@ es , compil@@ es and exports content that has a monetary or cultural value . quot ;
metadata is defined as data about data . metadata is data , according to your definition , to provide information about or documentation of other data that are administered by an application or environment .
if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then you definitely don &apos;t use &amp; digi@@ cam ; . the approach to store metadata in both a database and in the image files guarantees very fast searches and secure archiving that you can freely access with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate something into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure . your image files must somehow be organized on your computer . you must decide if you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc ; make sure you have to switch to a larger drive .
you might be happy with this structure . vacation pictures can quickly be found on your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place . if you make enough photos , then you will use sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; then export is a folder for images you print or publish on a website .
professional photographers have other requirements , such as version@@ ing of photos , archiving , work sequences , constant supply of images to different themes and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % archives and 5 % work files will have and you will then not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content .
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier . dis@@ connect old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a deri@@ v@@ ative image .
we also recommend storing metadata in the editing page of the metadata in &amp; digi@@ cam ; this ensures that EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data are written to the file . if you forget this , you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the appropriate item in the Album .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what if you want to change which ? added &amp; digi@@ cam ; they provide them with a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones .
of course you can select all the images that need the same attribute and set the value then . you start best with the rating or ranking . this makes sense as you can focus on the best photos at work .
let us now with keywords , keywords , such as you are often called by other programs , or continue categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
when you import cat@@ alog@@ u@@ ed images from another source with embedded keywords , it is edited and digi@@ ti@@ zed ; automatically build the tree for you or to do it by drag@@ ging one sub @-@ tree to another . the changed keywords will be edited by &amp; digi@@ cam ; updated as it tracks the sub@@ trees .
the graph shows how different metadata overl@@ aps . this is a very rough representation since each block of metadata consists of many sections . file names and calendar data are properties of all images .
enough of the keywords - the next section refers to labels or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata .
you don &apos;t want to share your photos with your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies . you &apos;re sure to be interested in how your photos arrive .
look at this panorama . from a distance there is not even a nice panorama of the beach . if you look at it closer you start to see some details , people , the place .
and now I say to you that this is the landing site of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in French Norman@@ die 60 years after landing . wow ! you start dre@@ aming , having associations , memories , the historical period is again present , you may even hear the silence .
for others who consider your photos , the title might be more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transfer the importance to the viewer , to help him understand the motive that moved you to understand what you understand .
it is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a lab@@ eling for itself alone .
with &amp; digi@@ cam ; you can set any amount of text , in an internation@@ alized alphab@@ et ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) , as let@@ tering . you can even set it for a selection of images at the same time . K@@ DE even provides you with a spell checking system .
do you remember the time before GPS ? when you had to find another city without a navigation system ? was it not a te@@ di@@ ous planet in front of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of spatial presentation is already using light speed .
the possibilities of utilizing ge@@ ol@@ ocation are countless and will become even more profound in the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your travels using pictures with geographic information .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and den@@ otes the practice to use the copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same fre@@ edoms also apply in all changed versions , so also for the works of others .
the following description tells you what information should be stored in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ cam ; as information it should be stored :
author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should include your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desired to protect the name of the photographer , then the name of a company or organization may be used .
author &apos;s title ( syn@@ onym for author @-@ line ) : associated with the author . this field contains the photographer &apos;s job description . examples of this can be titles such as : employee photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer .
editor ( syn@@ onym for vendors ) : use the provider field to identify who works the photo . if the photographer works for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations can be listed here , which offers the image to others . if the image is a stock photo , then the group / agency that offers the image here is given here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright passages even though they do not provide protection against mis@@ use . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with computers can delete or modify them in the image . for private persons , this is very important for most of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals this protection is very important .
digital water@@ mark is unique per image . &amp; digi@@ cam ; in the near future such a module will be available for batch processing .
topics : disk failure , record loss , surge protection , EC@@ C , transmission errors , aging of storage media , recovery , redund@@ ancy , disaster prevention , life time , temperature , data size , spread super@@ sti@@ tion
of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or a fire . this kind of loss is the same that can happen to you in traditional paper photographs or neg@@ atives .
bank@@ roll on@@ TRA@@ CK , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics which causes data loss .
to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs , these must be treated cau@@ ti@@ ously and you can no longer buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which last longer , harder to get and much more expensive . there are offers about gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 this piece which requires a lifetime of 100 years . whether you believe it is in your discretion .
CD / DVD discs can be un@@ readable but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and sound recording devices and store them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write a lot more reliable .
CDs and DVDs are very suscep@@ tible to errors even if you have just written . therefore , they use a control box mechanism to protect yourself . however , 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and check@@ sums . despite this massive protection , they age by chemical ageing , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc .
for defective CDs and DVDs , there is a convenient program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster that apparently works miracles in CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; but is still not available for Mac@@ s . there are similar applications to read damaged data from damaged disks , hard disks , flash drives , USB drives , etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks seem to capture the format war against HD DVD . a dual layer Blu @-@ ray disc can save 50 GB , and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8.5 GB . all that has been said to CDs and DVDs is of course also valid for the Blu @-@ ray disc .
record the media with a description , date &amp; author and then store it on a clean , dark , dry and protected spot . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that this media can read .
Disk@@ manufacturers retain your statistics for themselves . their manufacturers &apos; warran@@ ties include a new disk but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the fault mechanisms of hard drives : disk failure report
bre@@ vity is the most common error cause , S@@ MA@@ RT is the most common error cause , S@@ MA@@ RT cannot detect this error . some errors identified by S@@ MA@@ RT indicate the im@@ min@@ ent failure . this is especially reading errors and publishing counts . the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years .
this is the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course you can also recover data loss due to a power failure before you have saved the files , but these losses can usually be recovered without major problems .
while most electrical devices don &apos;t matter much , it looks different in devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processors . these can cause serious damage . on your computer these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause locked key@@ boards , complete data loss , hardware switch , destroyed motherboard and other defects . thus protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most common protection against spi@@ kes is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs part of the energy heat and gro@@ unded the rest . it is usually available in the form of a connector bar . however , remember that not every connector bar also contains an over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , you should ensure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard , which guarantees a certain minimum of protection .
since an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should ensure that also all peripheral devices connected to your system are protected . some manufacturers also provide over@@ voltage protection which also includes a telephone connection for your modem . others provide connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable modem and the TV card .
if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially developed for not@@ ebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem .
while an over@@ voltage protection system protects your system against minor fluctuations in the power lines it will not really help you with a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore make sense to invest in an un@@ interrupted power supply .
in addition to protecting against over@@ vol@@ tages , these devices can automatically supply battery power when a power out@@ age occurs . some models allow them to continue to work until the current runs . if you buy an U@@ PS , you should be sure they meet the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . in addition , the lifetime of the battery and the supplied software is of interest .
consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare its security with electricity disrup@@ tions with the costs to avoid this . a high quality over@@ voltage protection can get you for less than &amp; euro ; 40 . this is only a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected with it . at the end , you should always remember all the cables before you go on holiday .
the Amazon web service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration you can use it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software .
you are , however , very expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; dollars ; 500 . in addition , you have to send the data about the comparatively slow Internet .
the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to a local data loss of the most important images . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general securing solution .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are available on photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online .
from the perspective of data backup , the web solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatically cleaned thanks to the TCP protocol and the large companies offer a backup and a distributed memory .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain on the computer . all trans@@ missions are suscep@@ tible to transmission errors . the Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs file system ensure at least the data integrity between the operating system and the hard drive .
all these disturbances remain und@@ et@@ ected until you open a photo and this is destroyed to your surprise . no one seems to have ever thought about it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much secure data route than that in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission loss , since they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are currently not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of errors annually .
Z@@ FS von Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle disk errors at a low level and are highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a license for Solaris and Leopard under a GP@@ L in@@ compatible license .
Oracle launched its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs file system . it is still in alpha state . it uses the same protection mechanisms that Z@@ FS uses and is also available for &amp; Linux ; however , it is not yet part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss in the not@@ ebook and 46 % of the work@@ station systems .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it causes less damage than th@@ ef@@ ts or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; hasn &apos;t been seen for a long time .
open source file systems are less suscep@@ tible to data loss than proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the most common file systems . you can find a very good English article here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupted data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file was not completely saved before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human error are the main causes of data loss .
sensors from digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aperture sets from fundamental physical limits . it is meant that while the technology continues to develop there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far from this limit .
even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result more wor@@ sen@@ ing . a sensor size of 6 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els and a high @-@ quality optics are the optimum for compact cameras . even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolutions , you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
you get a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not blame anyone else for data loss . thus , 6 % of all PCs are affected by a data loss each year . therefore , backup your data after a plan and test this backup before you make any dangerous as the re@@ installation of your operating system , the replacement of disks or the res@@ izing of hard drives .
suppose you make your back@@ ups every day on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a lightning strike you are lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment .
a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . don &apos;t forget an airplane gap : fire , water , electricity , children and th@@ ef@@ ts are dangerous enough for your data . they usually affect a whole room or the entire house .
therefore , disaster prevention always means not local storage . bring your f@@ uses up the stairs , into the neighboring house , into your office or similar .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as mentioned above is a common reason for data loss despite f@@ use . if you have a backup which is not immediately available , then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files to be backed up . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential protection : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . generates a complete snapshot of two time points : the complete backup and the last differential protection .
incre@@ mental backup : backup of files that have been changed since the last backup . create multiple sn@@ apshots . you can restore the original status at any time on which such backup has been made . this backup comes closest to an exception that is only scanned and not running .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts , r@@ sync only copies the difference of the files that were really changed .
backup important images directly after saving them on your computer to a DVD or other optical media .
this procedure allows you enough time to detect and restore losses . at the same time you come for backup but with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of working files . at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month .
topics : metadata , IP@@ TC stored in the image file , associated X@@ MP files , preserving original , memory , scal@@ ability , media , retri@@ eving images and metadata , copying images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , viewing devices , ... , usage of the Internet .
to enable valuable images to survive the next 40 years , that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
since the future is un@@ predictable due to your nature , you must consider all that is said today with caution and re @-@ evaluate while time passes . unfortunately , you should ask yourself how the current system is backwards compatible . the less variations you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future .
this question should be answered by the explanations in this document . use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtualization is available for everyone today . so if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , storage and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer default . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the technical expression for the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s assume you have sc@@ aled the scal@@ ability and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition . on * nix systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and transfer it to a new disk :
check with the command d@@ mes@@ g whether your new record has been detected by the system , but don &apos;t hang it .
/ dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollar ; Par@@ ted res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c # works with ext@@ 2.3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and rei@@ ser@@ fs &amp; dollar ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # modi@@ fies the size of the disk if necessary
open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no software that can read it , you can create it yourself .
GIF is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market . therefore , you should not use it anymore .
it is loss@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . the disadvantage is that it requires relative many administrative information , but not as many as TIFF and has a slow compression .
TIFF was widely used as image format . TIFF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a loss@@ less compression algorithm ( Def@@ late ) . however , a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people . therefore , there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG is a ro@@ yalty @-@ free and open image format designed by Adobe Systems . D@@ NG has been developed on the basis of the need to uni@@ fy the camera ear formats . it is based on the TIFF / EP format and required to use metadata . a handful of camera manufacturers already provide D@@ NG and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon will use it sometime .
this is possibly one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML based X@@ MP technology to replace &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Metad@@ ata Plat@@ forms ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a coding technology that allows users to embed their data into a file itself .
many photographers prefer to archive an original of your recording , mostly in raw format . X@@ MP is suitable for storing the metadata separately from the image file . however , it can cause problems when linking between the metadata file and the image file , and as mentioned above , you should consider whether you use D@@ NG as a container and place everything there .
the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models . the activities of D@@ C@@ MI are part of the D@@ C@@ MI communities and the D@@ C@@ MI work@@ groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard links and enligh@@ tening efforts to achieve widespread acceptance of metadata standards and practices .
import pictures from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the pictures are on the camera edi@@ ts , you can use it as a temporary backup .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them to your raw archive . this feature is not yet implemented .
for a fine editing you can use external programs . if you edit the images again with &amp; digi@@ cam ; edit , then you should add the metadata again .
protect the edited images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . then export them to web galleries , code into m@@ peg , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ cam ; to get . in the Ad@@ ding a Photo to an album you can add a description of how you can add photos that you already have on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for im@@ porting images to your Al@@ b database .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ cam ; to use , connect these to the computer , switch the camera to display mode and switch it on . another description can be found in the manual of your camera .
when you start the camera interface , it tries to connect with your camera . if the connection is made , a Fer@@ tig indicator appears at the bottom and the thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera are displayed . if this is the case , the filen@@ ames and a symbol for the file allocation for each file , photos , movies , music etc. are displayed on the camera .
before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . with the features and metadata from the camera interface you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata .
this dialog displays file properties and the photo information that is internally stored by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras don &apos;t have all the information available .
the Metad@@ ata tab displays the internal metadata such as Ex@@ if , manufacturer notice , GPS , etc. of the image . this information is the same as with the metadata page strip from the main window of &amp; digi@@ cam ; or image processing . note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras .
the simplest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the download button and then download the selection of all . this loads all photos from their camera to a single album in &amp; digi@@ cam ; . when downloading , the photos are not deleted and we recommend you check if the pictures were safely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you do not want to download all the photos , you can select only the desired one with the default selection methods of &amp; k@@ de ; once you have selected the photos , use the download button and then download the selected one .
if your camera supports this , an option New is available . these images have not been edited by &amp; digi@@ cam until now ; in this case the new pictures are marked with a star in the preview window . if you choose this option , of course only the new pictures will be downloaded .
if you are using the Select All or download Sel@@ ected button , a dialog will appear where you can select the target album in which the photos are stored . you can see the list of existing albums in the My Albums tab . then select the folder from the list and press OK .
after selecting the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ cam ; loads the photos from the camera into the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all of them at once by del@@ eting the Del@@ ete button . if you want to delete only some , you need to select them first and then delete the selected delete .
please note that there is no way to recover photos that you have deleted from the camera . so you should carefully check if the photos have been successfully downloaded from the camera . if you want to delete the camera , you should do so via the camera bed , as this is much faster .
the filen@@ ames are normally used again after the photos have been deleted from the camera . this can lead to dup@@ licate file names , if you load photos from different recording studios into the same Album . therefore , it may be useful to integrate the date and time the image has been taken into the file name .
in the next section , you will find options for rotating and mirr@@ oring the image and for date @-@ based sub @-@ albums . if you use this latter option , a folder is automatically created per day .
the options Dur@@ ing the transfer opens three more options that will be performed before the photos are stored on the disk . when selecting this , the corresponding entries will be copied from the Ex@@ if information to the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option , you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images .
for example , if you wish to use another format as the default format , you can use the pre@@ fix to add the pre@@ fix to % Y % H : % H : % S in the editing field . turn on the date &amp; time option . for more adjustments , you should read the help of the str@@ f@@ time command .
if you use the option camera filen@@ ame , you have the option to change the file names in lo@@ wer@@ case when you download it . or in upper@@ case if you prefer .
the new file name , the &amp; digi@@ cam ; used for a photo , is displayed below the name that the camera provides in preview . your settings to ren@@ ame are stored and automatically used when you next open the camera window .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; can use all information about the orientation of the camera to the time point of recording to perform an automatic rotation during shut@@ down . not all cameras provide this information . in the Metad@@ ata section , you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo .
the automatic turn is usually on , and if your camera doesn &apos;t deliver this information , it can be digi@@ ti@@ zed ; the photo is in its original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic turn , use the Advanced button and select the Automatic rotation at the bottom of the window .
if your camera provides information about the date the photo was made available , it can be digi@@ ti@@ zed ; use this to automatically create sub @-@ albums in the target album when downloading . all images with the same date are uploaded into the same sub@@ album . not all cameras provide this information . in the section of the met@@ a data you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos .
this option is usually turned off , and in this case it stores &amp; digi@@ cam ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to switch this option . use the Advanced tab and select the date @-@ based sub @-@ albums at the bottom of the window .
the simplest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the download button . then select Upload . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files you want to upload . you can also select more than one file with the default &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image selection is done , it asks &amp; digi@@ cam ; you , where the images should be uploaded . a folder sel@@ ector dialog for the camera appears . select the desired folder here and click OK to start the upload . images will not be deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a generic term in this document . this refers to a position that is indicated in Long@@ itude and l@@ atitude and can be displayed on a map . the data can be determined by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system .
not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link an image with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses an airplane to map an area by automatic recording of GPS data . environmental planner , military , police , architecture offices and real estate agents can use this capability .
if you later forgot where exactly the photo was made , you can open a browser that indicates the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ cam ; user who wants to locate the location of the photo thus , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to store the position data of a photo .
the question is , how do the GPS data get into the picture ? first , you should know that exi@@ v2 supports many GPS data fields , such as direction , sem@@ it@@ rail@@ ers and map references . there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the right hardware , via post @-@ processing of the GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic mapping ( manual ) and finally via manual input of known places .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few working together with GPS receivers . either as card module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR ri@@ oh Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from a device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . however , you have to save this data in the GP@@ X format as this is the only format supported by the module for geographic mapping .
there are different programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and from GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; make g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know long@@ itude and l@@ atitude or other data , then you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ u@@ if@@ config by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the sig@@ natures most ha@@ iry co @-@ ordin@@ ates , such as map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com does not show European road maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; tries to give you so much control over his work processes as possible . there are many settings that changed the behavior of &amp; digi@@ cam ; to access these settings , you need to choose in the Options menu ; you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left side .
select Action can display on Embedded Pre@@ view or start image editing . so you specify the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ cam ; fix if you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the standardization and copyright data . these data are automatically written to the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields when the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface .
author title is a syn@@ onym for author @-@ line : this field should contain the professional title of the photographer . this can be desig@@ nations such as employed photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . as this is a more detailed description of the car field , this must also be filled .
editor is a syn@@ onym for vendors : use this field to specify the image that the photo offers . this does not have to be the author , if it works for a news agency , such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then the group or agency that provides the picture should be listed here .
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC field . this means that the metadata is permanently included in the image and not only in the digi@@ cam database ; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be edited in &amp; digi@@ cam ; imported without getting lost .
image labels as embedded cap@@ tions ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos with the lab@@ eling embedded in the images . this allows your cap@@ tions to be read by other image viewers .
the Settings page contains all the options for the information that appears when the cursor is in the main window over a file . depending on the selected option , this information is displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ cam ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to indicate which file types &amp; digi@@ cam ; view , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list . any file in one &amp; digi@@ cam ; album folders that does not have any of these extensions will be edited by &amp; digi@@ cam ; ignored .
you can reset the default settings by pressing the Ref@@ res@@ h button on the right of each category .
the settings of the brightness of &amp; digi@@ cam ; can be set to the default values on this page . however , whenever you open the illuminated table , these settings are turned on if possible . however , some images have different sizes and the syn@@ ch@@ rone mode is then not available . if you have one , then you can obtain better viewing results .
by default , image editing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select them here . you can turn off the toolbar if you use image editing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark@@ er or bright color in the picture . these colors are specified here . in image processing , this picture mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
with Chro@@ ma @-@ sub@@ sampling , it is meant that the images are enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of lumin@@ ance than in color information . please read this article in Wikipedia for more information .
with the PNG compression option , you can reduce the size of PNG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality , since PNG is used by a loss@@ less algorithm . if you have a fast calcul@@ ator , you can set this value to a high compression .
with the option TIFF Com@@ pression you can comp@@ ress the f@@ late compression algorithm for TIFF images . this reduces the size of the TIFF images . it does not affect the image quality because the f@@ late algorithm works loss@@ less .
even if you select the los@@ sy setup , the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than normal JPEG . when this paragraph has been written , metadata hasn &apos;t been supported yet , but was in the planning .
in previous versions of &amp; digi@@ cam , image editing was only one image viewer for photos . currently , it quickly becomes a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog you can change the image editing settings .
the standard assumption is that all green pixels are the same . if the red pixels of the CCD sensor react more sensitive to ultra@@ violet light than the pixels with odd lines , this difference causes a grid pattern in output . if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimal loss of details . this option draws the picture a little soft , but eliminates the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern with the V@@ NG@@ - or A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used .
this setting is only used when white balance is not set . standard is a fixed colour balance based on a white card that was photograph@@ ed in the sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD S@@ LR cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images will get more details in the sh@@ utter lights in four steps . for other cameras , this option is ignored .
the standard is it the top lights , so the parts of your images that are burned into the settings , due to the inability of your camera to look at the pointed lights . the setting colors triggers some unusual results , since it shows the pointed lights in various ro@@ ses . finally , you can try to re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the pointed lights .
this is possible since blue pixels generally do not satur@@ ate as quickly as green and red . &amp; digi@@ cam ; and d@@ cra@@ p therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red portions from the still not saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a question of how much color or white you want .
when you select the Rec@@ on@@ struc@@ ted option , you get the possibility to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be individually adapted for each picture .
set the L@@ umin@@ ance value to your taste . you probably need to set it slightly higher than the standard 1 . however , this can also be done later in the digital &amp; digi@@ cam image options . to keep the time for the Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing , you should proceed conserv@@ atively .
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image processing algorithm to calculate a complete image from the particle data that many cameras have and which provides a matrix of colored pixels . this algorithm is also known as C@@ FA inter@@ pol@@ ation or color construction .
and D@@ cra@@ w provides three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it looks like this . V@@ NG Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dients ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w . it produces color art@@ ef@@ acts on the edges . bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable result .
if you know the color deviation of your lenses , you can set red and blue correc@@ ting values here . this is certainly the best method for gra@@ ft correction , as you are done during the shell conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates color information and gives instructions how to be given back . L@@ CMS and digi@@ cam also exist ; information such as colour information can be translated from one colour space to the other , so that the colors are as accurate as possible .
behavior If an image is opened in image processing / Color management module with raw files start .
color Profile Set Fol@@ der the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you can store all your profiles .
settings of the ICC @-@ Pro@@ files You have here the option &amp; quot ; Def@@ ault ; for your profiles to be stored . everything can be changed when opening the raw file later .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your pictures color managed not the entire screen .
the input profiles should fit to the camera manufacturer and model you use . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , such as Canon , which do not contain any color t@@ weak@@ ing or g@@ amma correction . currently , d@@ cra@@ w G@@ amma is not correc@@ ting for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means you have to perform the color mapping yourself .
there are other options such as the Soft Pro@@ of Profile , which allows you to em@@ ulate how your image would be returned from a device . this is very useful before you print image as your printer has a smaller color area than your camera and some colors therefore can work very saturated . this could be corrected manually instead of getting on the flas@@ hing algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras , it &apos;s quite obvious what color profile is intended for them . unfortunately not with the models from Canon . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together .
the Canon profile extension makes it possible to recognize the style for the target : F for an exact style , L for landscapes , N for neutral , p for portrait and S for standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; image plugin interface . it is an interface supported by a range of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and image processing . by providing this interface , &amp; digi@@ cam ; many modules supported to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has the K@@ IP@@ I modules installed , you will see a list of available modules . select the ones you want to use , and these are then added by &amp; digi@@ cam ; these modules will appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition you will find some also in the context menu of the preview .
short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings Sh@@ ort@@ cuts .
more information about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained from the K@@ IP@@ I project under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the slide show should be easy to understand . the upper knob adjust@@ s the time between the image transitions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds . the other check boxes switch the metadata , respectively , which are displayed at the bottom of the images during the ad .
the camera properties show on the left side a list of all supported cameras . on the right @-@ hand side there is a button automatic detection , which tries to identify a camera that is connected to the computer . if you want to use this , make sure that the camera is properly connected , switched on and in the image display mode . currently , here are serial , USB and USB / Fire@@ Wire bulk storage supported .
at the bottom end you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active if you have selected a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera list . you must specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / Rem@@ ov@@ able , on which you attach your camera .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ cam ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer , place it in the display mode and switch it on .
check if &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; the camera automatically detects . if not , you can set camera models and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera .
you can select any name for your camera . it is displayed in the camera &apos;s main window . if you have more than one camera , you can insert all of them here .
with the option Con@@ soli@@ dation dialog for moving pictures into the garbage can show you the inter@@ loc@@ ator of &amp; digi@@ cam ; when del@@ eting a photo in an album , you can find more details when del@@ eting a photo and del@@ eting an album .
editorial changes through the right side@@ bar can be tac@@ itly edited by &amp; digi@@ kam ; if you use the option to apply changes to the right side@@ bar without queries . otherwise , you will have to save the changes with the button Chan@@ ges .
you can also display the welcome screen of &amp; digi@@ cam ; stop when starting . this will speed up the start @-@ up of &amp; digi@@ cam under certain circumstances .
setting Start after new photos requires &amp; digi@@ cam ; to search the basic folder after new or deleted albums / photos . this extends the start time of &amp; digi@@ cam ; if something is deleted from the base folder , it asks &amp; digi@@ cam ; it asks if it should delete it from the database .
different color schemes can be edited in &amp; digi@@ cam ; used to customize the main window to your taste . these settings can be selected under Settings design from the toolbar . a preview of the available designs is listed below :
these designs have been defined in plain text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for and digi@@ ti@@ zed , you will find more information about this in this tutorial .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; contains a fast image editing with some basic tools . you can use it to view and correct your photos . editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or through the context menu of the preview and selection of the item View / Edit .
image Edi@@ ting includes a set of tools to improve your pictures . some of them may be digi@@ ti@@ zed as modules . so you may not be part of your distribution . for more information on the K@@ IP@@ I modules , see Set@@ ting Image Processing section .
a status line at the bottom of the window displaying the filen@@ ame , current filen@@ ame , magni@@ fying factor and the current image size .
a menu bar at the top and among them the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently needed functions .
the editing features of the image processing change your photos . however , none of the features will change the original photo before using the Save or button Save button from the toolbar . note that you can no longer restore the original photo once you have saved the image .
you may want to make a copy of your image before you change it . this can be done with file Save as exec@@ uting .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the Rest@@ ore button from the File menu or the button Rest@@ ore the image processing restore in the toolbar . you then lose any change you &apos;ve done on the photo since the last memory .
virtually any image processing action can be revers@@ ed or restored . the last action can be revers@@ ed by editing or restoring Edit by selecting Edit Rec@@ over from the menu .
if you use this frequently , you should call the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ trl ; -@@ Z to undo and remember C@@ trl ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to restore .
if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; by pressing the Return or Rec@@ over button in the toolbar for a moment , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions are revers@@ ed or restored .
once you have started editing the image , you can move between the photos in the same album or keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar , image high , down or the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes to the current photo , you will be asked if you want to save them .
you can enter the photo in and zoom out in which you can use C@@ trl ; scroll wheel or the icons in the toolbar or entries in the view menu .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the toolbar : select the magni@@ fying factor automatically
view Full Screen mode displays the picture in full screen mode . you enter the normal view in which you use the Es@@ c button . normally , you can see the editing pane . if you do not want this , you can view it in the editing dialog ; view the main window . see the section for setting up image editing .
if you want to print the current image , you can select Print from the File menu and get the default &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can customize the settings before printing your photo .
from the main menu you can print single images or whole sets . all image preview pages can be printed from your selection . you only need to select the images with the standard methods and select Print Ass@@ ist from the Album Edit menu . if you follow the wizard , you just need to make your choice .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; main window has a side@@ bar on the right side , providing important information and actions for the selected images . the same side@@ bar is available without the navigation arrows , also in image processing . it is displayed when one of the five tab@@ s is cli@@ cked :
multiple clicks on the same tab lets the side@@ bar appear or disappear again to the border .
the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . labels are copied to the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ T@@ C@@ - fields so that you can be used by other programs .
IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are tr@@ unc@@ ated after 2000 characters and special characters are res@@ hap@@ ed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC label field in other applications , you should consider these limitations .
after you have commented , use either the App@@ ly button or simply switch to the next image , the labels will then be saved .
with this button you can read more metadata from the selected file or database . however , you can also write the metadata in the files , but this is always done when you have chosen a metadata adjustment that is always written in the images .
the review shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars into the side@@ bar or with the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ trl + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images simultaneously , select it and use the context menu .
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC @-@ field ur@@ gency . the code follows the scheme in the following table :
the keyword view displays a search box for filtering the keywords , the keyword tree and a selection box with the keywords used previously in this &amp; digi@@ cam ; session .
the keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search word . you can limit the number of possibilities in search of a keyword quickly . this ability is particularly useful if you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom of the page is a further relief when entering keywords in a series of images . if you have entered different keywords , they are saved for quick access .
keywords can also be entered in the tree by selecting the respective check boxes . all keywords of an image are stored in the keyword keyword .
if multiple images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword tree , this only applies to the highlighted text and not to the entire selection , if you want to provide a selection with a keyword , please refer to the keyword filter section .
the Key@@ word filter side@@ bar is used to change the selection of the images shown in the main window . normally , the left side@@ bar is used with their album , - dat@@ um@@ - , keyword and search views . if additionally one or more keywords are used from the right side , only the intersection of these two is displayed . all created keywords are available .
you can also draw and drop keywords . suppose you have selected multiple images in the main view to provide you with keywords . if the keyword already exists , you can simply pull it out of the right side@@ bar and place it on the selection . then a dialog appears asking you whether you want to set the keyword .
in the upper example , the main window displays the images on a calendar day . the keyword filter is set to No keywords , which reduces the amount to three images , and then a keyword is drawn from the right keyword tree to the selection and stored there . a dialog promp@@ ts whether this keyword should be set .
this search for changes takes place every time you start the program . it can also be switched off under Settings .
if you have a rule with and created and find that it should be one or its , you can change this easily with a double click on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry after which is searched in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , picture , keyword , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string that is already set in the database .
for example , you can set an Advanced search on all the elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group options , you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then select the group button . the options will then look like this :
why were Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Fli@@ ck@@ r not listed ? the free space is limited to 1@@ GB and you won &apos;t want to save the images in full resolution there .
this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly edited it to &amp; digi@@ cam ; s concrete implementation adapted .
the reason why you use a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colours used by your camera or scanner will be a predictable deviation from the actual photograph@@ ed or scanned colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow you can achieve that the colors on your monitor are the same and that the colors you print or publish in the web that correspond to those from your digital dark room .
if the topic comes to color management , everyone wants to know which buttons it needs to press for the results he wants . unfortunately , ink management means that you can make informed decisions at any point in the image processing work@@ flows . in addition , you should provide you with sufficient background information about color management . in addition , you should allow you to make your own informed choices so that you can obtain the desired result .
if your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about color management .
you work on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB color space . ( see below for more information )
your only other picture editions are by email or the web , where s@@ RGB is the de facto standard .
so if s@@ RGB works so well and makes life so easy for everyone , why should you use another color space and have to think about color man@@ ners ?
a visual example of the limitation of s@@ RGB compared to the colors we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e @-@ shaped region , and the colors in s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger color spaces , please visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om &apos;s excellent site and click info and then information about RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I need to c@@ alli@@ ate my monitor if I decided to work only in s@@ RGB color space ?
yes ! whether you are working in s@@ RGB colour space or not , you have to c@@ alli@@ br@@ ate your monitor , because s@@ RGB is c@@ alli@@ br@@ ated . the cryst@@ alli@@ zation of your monitor closes the circle . if you are working as s@@ RGB color space , you either need to set your monitor to the s@@ RGB standard , use a matching monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions that can improve an image in most cases . therefore , use it before attempting any further manual processing .
the functions Norm@@ alizing , adjusting , Automatic balancing and contrast extend from the Cor@@ rec@@ ting Automatic Cor@@ rection Menu will automatically try to make the most of your colors . you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method scales the den@@ ial values over the entire image , so that the dark@@ est point black and the brigh@@ test dot will change as bright as possible without changing its shade .
similar : this method adjust@@ s the intensity @-@ factor of the color of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity channel becomes as flat as possible . sometimes it produces very good results in the improvement of the contrast of an image , sometimes it produces only garbage . it is a very powerful operation that works either miracles in a picture or it destro@@ ys it .
automatic balancing : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in the red , green and blue channel . it detects the dark and bright border tones and adjust@@ s the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogram section .
contrast : this method improves the contrast and brightness of RGB value of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the wid@@ est possible range and a new ji@@ b of all values in between . this is only visible in full @-@ washed images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ cam ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo .
the white balance correction is slightly limited as a color space with 8 bits per color is worked . so if you are too far from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure may occur . if you can do the white balance in rough mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities for correction will be better .
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is copy@@ ri@@ ghted by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . you can start it via menu entry colors white balance of image processing .
the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left you can see both the original image as well as the preview of the target image . the preview will dynamically adjust the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original white balance then it is enough to click on the sub@@ window .
the preview of the target photo has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel under this marker is shown as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
right above is a hist@@ ogram showing that dynamically changes as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well lit photos , most pixels have very small lumin@@ ance values . with one button you can decide if one of the three colors or your total is displayed .
the contrast of your result depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shade adjustment lets you enhance or lower the shadow details of your photos .
to play An@@ stat with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the color temperature of the white balance to calculate the color temperature of the white balance . in this way the temperature and green values are set automatically .
in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of preferences . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed . you will get the combined result in the white balance . this is indicated in preview as pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the Save As and Load buttons make exactly this . any adjustment of the white balance you have set can be saved to a text file and load later .
the Pre@@ ferences button sets back all fil@@ ter@@ values back to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance . note that even neutral settings will result in another picture than your original . if you save them , your original image will be changed .
you can adjust the encoding depth per color channel of the edited image . 8 @-@ bit coding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit coding is better suited for high @-@ quality images . this encoding also requires more disk space , computing time and is available only for the formats PNG , P@@ N@@ M , TIFF and D@@ NG .
this tool opens the same dialog as the editing of color profiles . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . color mapping can be done through the sub@@ window for the brightness . detailed instructions for using color profiles can be consul@@ ted in the Color Management chapter .
another important tool is available in the menu under Col@@ ors Ke@@ ep Cor@@ rection . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels at the same time and allows you to use them for multiple photos . this is useful if your camera or scanner always make the same error and therefore always need the same correction .
a very powerful possibility to correct exposure issues is the tool for gra@@ dation that you will find under color gra@@ dation in the menu .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; tool color effects provide four color effects , a solar system effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a edge filter .
in times of chemical processing , Solar@@ isation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , was an effect that was created when a partially developed pressure applied a short flash light and then completed the development of the image . this had the effect that the brigh@@ ter areas were dark@@ er and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second illumination . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine .
the intensity controls the solar ion@@ ization . at approx . 50 % intensity , the image shows what is chem@@ ically possible . a further increase finally creates a negative image that is not to be produced on photographic paper .
this is an example of the solar system effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and it processes the ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from satur@@ ation by having a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . just try it , it em@@ belli@@ sh@@ es many photos .
Vel@@ via is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers highly saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts . the characteristics make it a film of choice for nature photographers .
the ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light on the contrasting edges . the level controls the brightness of the result and the sli@@ ders repeti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on light . in large images the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and brightness of the photo . you can try to experiment the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . once you are satisfied with the result use the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
if you make a photo in bad light conditions , you can get the reverse problem : a too big satur@@ ation . also in this case the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation rather than increase it . all changes you can perform can be previ@@ ewed . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ ous intensity / contrast / g@@ amma , the tool is based on a sound correction to improve the exposure . even if the dialog for this tool appears very complicated , you only need the area of the slide for the purpose explained here .
the window contains a graph of the intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . below the graph three sli@@ ders are cli@@ cked into which can be shifted to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn how to use it is to shift knob and observe how the image changes .
on the right you can see the original and the preview of the picture . the preview will be dynamically updated based on the settings of the image . the following options are available on the left .
sc@@ aling : with this selection box it is possible to adjust whether the hist@@ ogram is represented with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic Y axis . for images of a digital camera the linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single column . in this case the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic distribution is more useful .
three controls : the upper one for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones , often called Gam@@ ma@@ xes .
the three color pin@@ boards can be used in preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of the shadows , middle and light tones . in addition , there is a button for fully automatic adjustment .
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controllers that can be used to change the output values inter@@ actively as with the input values . for example , the compression of the output values can be used to create a ble@@ ached image as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground .
automatic : with this button the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image .
save as and store : with these buttons , the set values can be stored in the file system and loaded later . for this , the Gim@@ p level format is used .
if you use this mode and three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input values are automatically read@@ just@@ ed for all shadows , means and sun shades . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the red , green , blue and the lumin@@ ance channels .
the Over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it is no effect to see the final result .
below you can see an example of adjusting the input values to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original picture is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) .
on the left side , half of the original and the target image will be displayed . the preview will be dynamically updated depending on your preferences . the following options are available on the right :
modi@@ fier Channel : this selection box allows you to specify the channel that is modified by the module :
next to this box are two icons to switch between a linear and a log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . for pictures taken with a digital camera is mostly the linear mode of the most useful . for pictures with large areas of a constant color , linear mode creates a wide bar . in this case , log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode will help .
for example , if you move a corner part to the right , i.e. the bright tones , you can see that these bright tones correspond with dark@@ er output tones and dark@@ er the corresponding pixels .
when you move this marker on the area you want to change , a matching line appears on the curve representing the original value . create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted according to your taste .
save as and store : with these buttons you can do exactly that . every curve you created can be saved in the file system and loaded later . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p curve format .
if you use this method and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels in the shadow , middle and sun tones . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
the Over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you only get the effect displayed in the preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below you can see a black @-@ and @-@ white photo that was corrected in the L@@ umin@@ anz@@ Canal . shadow and sun shades were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the digi@@ cam channel mixer ; image processing is a tool for improving the color channels or changing the colour shades of the photos .
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colour tones of the images . you can edit it from the menu Col@@ ors Mixer of the Image Processing .
with the channel selection box , you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first note how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and precip@@ itation . the left pane of the window will show you a preview . the original can be viewed for comparison with your own rider .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the picture , a vertical line appears in the hist@@ ogram to indicate the corresponding color value .
the controls for the module are right below : controls for Red , Green and Building allow you to mix these channels . if you enable L@@ umin@@ ance , the image will retain the overall brightness , even if you also enable the option Mon@@ och@@ rome , since the channel mixer is then THE tool for creating great black and white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits .
sometimes , especially when mixing mon@@ och@@ rome , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the colour space . colour space consists of small room art@@ ef@@ acts that do not appear at the same spot in the color channel and whose noise patterns appear different in each channel . if that &apos;s the case , you can improve your mon@@ och@@ rome version by first reducing the color space .
the Save as and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any mixer setting can be saved for later and then loaded . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the Over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it is no effect to see the final result .
below you can see a picture in which the blue channel has been read@@ just@@ ed . the L@@ umin@@ ance option is checked . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your ability to abstract . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step , as color images can easily be converted to the computer . also with a set of movie roller profiles .

green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good at all scene pictures and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky . thus similar to the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter .
orange filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos . thus , similar to the 00@@ 2 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) orange filter .
red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic cel@@ esti@@ al effects and can simulate mo@@ on@@ light scenes at the time of the day . thus , similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) red filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color tone correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
S@@ epi@@ Sher@@ aton : produces warm light and medium tones while it adds a bit of cold to the leaves . this is very similar to the process of ble@@ aching a pressure and re @-@ development in a S@@ epi@@ at@@ oner . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother and therefore similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) squ@@ am@@ ic filter .
use the &amp; digi@@ cam ; apply tool texture to apply decorative tex@@ tures to a picture .
by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color picture or not , you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait from enlarged points or like a wall painting on a wall .
relief : move this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the picture .
a paper text effect has been applied in the picture below . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the modified less ( 2 ) to see . the relief parameter has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ cam ; Add tool frame can be added a decorative frame around a picture .
keeping the eye of a viewer within the limits of a photo is not an easy task . a way to keep your attention is to expose the image to a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ attering eye . under picture frame , the module can be started from image processing .
type : with this parameter you set the desired frame type for your picture . continuous the image with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce surrounds it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white pictures ) , rounded it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame which is ideal for a kno@@ ck effect and decorative adding a decorative frame with patterns .
width : is the width of the frame in percent . the value range for the width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
the target image decorated with the frame will be larger than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . this is important for the print of the images , especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio .
with this handy tool , you can easily insert a format@@ ted text into an image at any location . this is also possible in several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text direction , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need it . the larger the image , the bigger the character set .
each setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you click the &quot; OK &quot; button . once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed .
with the &amp; digi@@ cam ; tool template you can put a template on a picture .
the Menu Image Tem@@ plate can be used in image processing can be used to place templates over a picture .
for the template there are no limitations concerning size and orientation . however , you need to take the PNG file format and should work with maximum comp@@ ressing ( 9 ) to reduce the file size of the template . if you want to add your template from the &amp; digi@@ cam ; Sch@@ ab@@ lon@@ en@@ datenbank , just send an e @-@ mail in Englisch to the &amp; digi@@ cam ; Mail@@ ing list digi@@ cam @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use this tool for the first time , you need to put your sten@@ cil @-@ folder with the button root folder in the dialog . select the folder in which you have copied the sten@@ cil files . these settings are scheduled for the next start .
after the root folder has been set for the templates appears a tree view that reflects the folder structure of the template folder . the selection of a folder automatically updates the preview toolbar of the templates .
below the preview you will find three buttons that allow you to change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button enlar@@ ges the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check with the left mouse button .
shrink : this button shr@@ inks the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you have to zoom the image accordingly . check with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move the image lying under the template . take the image and place it at the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template to your image . the image is then automatically adapted to the preview size .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas .
sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but produces gra@@ iny images especially in dark areas .
the sharp@@ ness mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture shar@@ per . actually it sharp@@ ens not a bit , it works rather psych@@ ically u@@ ell . you can use it to remove atmospheric ha@@ ze and it makes here a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is protected by copyright by Win@@ ston Ch@@ ang .
re@@ focusing is possibly the best of the three because it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment .
images without focus and most digit@@ alized images require a correction of the sharp@@ ness . this is because the digi@@ tization process must combine colors with only minimal differences to a color point . this , in turn , results in blur@@ red edges . the same phenomenon can be observed when ink points are printed on paper . S@@ LR cameras normally need more subsequently sharpen@@ ing than normal cameras for private users .
images in raw format , on the other hand , must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing .
some scann@@ ers turn a focus filter back while reading the image . if you disable this , you will get control of your image .
in some situations you can obtain useful results by sharpen@@ ing a photo using the sharpen@@ ing tool .
the sharp@@ ness increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also strengthens the noise . in general , the most suitable technique for sharpen@@ ing an image intensi@@ fies the tool . you can re@@ focus it via the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ ting . under re@@ focuss@@ ing you will find more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cris@@ p . the solution to draw the image a little soft is much easier than shar@@ pen it . use the tool for the soft sign with the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ t plas@@ tic@@ ise and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the Filter Exclu@@ sive mas@@ king is a very good tool to remove v@@ eils from your photos . a demonstration you can see here .
the original image and preview help you to edit the image . the preview window will show the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often generate good results and should be tested first . increasing the radius or amount of the amount increase the effect . if you make the blur@@ ring mask too strong , noise and the impression of gr@@ ates will produce near sharp edges .
the radius represents how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . therefore , you should best shar@@ pen images in their final resolution .
the amount indicates the percentage between the original and the blur@@ red image one which is added to the original . thus , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the difference amount . thus , the minimum difference is defined for an edge of the filter . thus areas with a soft change between the tones are exemp@@ t from shar@@ per and hence beauty errors in faces , skies and water surfaces are avoided .
this is an example of the blur@@ red filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . fu@@ zzy mask was used with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0 .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; tool re@@ focus re@@ focus a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ ri@@ ghted fol@@ dable filtering algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this is a better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Vienna film . the traditional technique for sharpen@@ ing images is the use of a bl@@ ur mask . re@@ focus normally allows better results than blur@@ red . you can start it from the menu by re@@ focusing colors in image processing .
in practice , the circular folding works much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche folding . the G@@ auss &apos;s fold has a very long tail , which leads to the mathematical result also depends on the source pixels that are far from original source pixels . in most cases , the FI@@ R Vienna in@@ verse of the Gau@@ ß &apos;s folding is even very strongly influenced by the distant pixels .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most pictures , the default value should be 1 good results . you can set a higher value if your image is blur@@ red and then pay attention to hal@@ o notes .
correlation : an increase in correlation can help reduce arti@@ facts . the correlation can be selected by 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0,5 and the values near 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the shar@@ per effect of the module .
noise filter : increasing the noise filter can help you reduce arti@@ facts . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 the image quality is very bad . a usable value is 0.@@ 03 . a high value will consume the image even further .
sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the sharp@@ ness of the sharp@@ ness . use this parameter if your sharp@@ ness Gau@@ ß is &apos; sch &apos; . in most cases , you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying arti@@ facts . if you use a non @-@ zero value , you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter .
matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in die size can generate good results , especially if you select large values for the spher@@ ical sharp@@ ness or the sharp@@ ness of the sharp@@ ness . note however that the module is very slow when you select large values for this parameter . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the Save as and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ focused parameter you set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
try to complete all tri@@ mming , color and intensity correc@@ tions before using the module .
otherwise you should use the module before changing the picture elsewhere . the reason for this is that much operations changes which are not immediately visible , but leave untouched arti@@ facts later .
if you read and comp@@ ress images , than JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally Un@@ inten@@ tional Mas@@ quer@@ ade produces better results than sharpen@@ ing . this could be caused by the inability to mask a larger neighborhood than sharpen@@ ing .
even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of the blur@@ ring . for the Viennese filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal Lin@@ e@@ are Filter . practically the result of the FI@@ R Vienna filter is always at least as good as the blur@@ ring mask . the FI@@ R Vienna filter is often better in the processing of small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters , applied on a small un@@ focused image :
the original un@@ sharp color image that needs to be corrected . this image has been made using an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens .
for more information on the methods of correction in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address .
the knob smooth@@ es the blur@@ ring of the area that has been dark@@ ened to create a more natural pup@@ il .
the ink ink allows a customized color for the pup@@ il . if you want to have blue eyes instead of dark ones , you can set this here .
the image error correction tool is one of the most developed tools to remove unwanted arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the painting algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains various pres@@ ets as starting points to simplify the restoration . the available pres@@ ets are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings more finely , you can use the tab smo@@ othing and advanced settings .
attention to detail p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the maintenance of the details . a small value leads to smooth smo@@ othing over the image . whereas larger values are mainly homogen@@ ous regions smo@@ othing and details sharp . a value of 0.@@ 9 should preserve details so that no sharpen@@ ing should be arranged afterwards .
direction dependence alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small amount smooth@@ es evenly in all directions , while a value is fl@@ atten@@ ed to 1 only in one direction . if you have a film gran@@ ulation or CCD rough@@ en will generate a high value wave @-@ like pattern . JPEG arti@@ facts are best removed at a value near 1 .
smo@@ othing &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smo@@ othing factor above all . p then defines the relative smo@@ othing . therefore , set this value corresponding to the degree of noise in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smooth@@ ed , because it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos; turbul@@ ence effect it must be set higher than 3 .
repeat : indicates how often the algorithm is tra@@ vers@@ ed . normally here 1 or 2 is sufficient .
angle incre@@ ment &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if alpha is chosen small , there should also be small choice . make sure that small angles produce a long running time . you should therefore choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs .
integrated step width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral step width in pixels . you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smo@@ othing and never larger than 2 .
use linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the increase in quality that you receive by choosing this option is just low , but it doubles the running time . we recommend it to leave it out .
the Save As and Load buttons make this exactly . any setting of image errors can be saved to a text file and loaded later .
correc@@ ting image errors is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take very long time to load a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the Cancel button .
below you can see how image errors are corrected using small arti@@ facts . the module will be applied to a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you see there is a peculiar black arti@@ fact in the foreground that caused by poor film storage during the trip . the original image is under ( 1 ) to see and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool for reducing noise . it uses a proprietary algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides selectable image filters to remove stain@@ s and other art@@ ef@@ acts , e.g. dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of scanned images from books or magazines .
if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial .
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gran@@ ular noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
the following is a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the Advanced Settings window can remain with default settings .
radius checks the window size , from 1 ( 3@@ x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) used for the filter . large values increase the time the filter is used per pixel and can bl@@ ur the image . the area indicated by the radius is smooth@@ ed and the color in it is smooth@@ ed and thus smaller mistakes are cleared .
sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness level . this value sets the pixel gap between the filter to the front to determine lumin@@ ance changes . if the value is too high , the adaptive filter image details will no longer be preserved and smo@@ kers or black@@ s@@ ors appear again .
edges : check edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , not all noise can be removed or noise peaks can occur . set it to a value close to the maximum , if you want to remove a weak ru@@ st@@ le or JPEG @-@ arti@@ facts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the light density tolerance of the image . we recommend you change color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smo@@ othing process that is controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend you change color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smo@@ othing process that is controlled by the details settings .
g@@ amma : controls the image tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dark@@ er areas typically smo@@ k@@ ed@@ . however , it also mer@@ ges the shadow areas .
damp@@ ing : controls the adjustment of phase j@@ itter damp@@ ing . this value defines how quickly the adaptive filter radius re@@ acts to variations of the lumin@@ ance density . when it is elevated , the edges appear smo@@ other when it is too high , noise and phase j@@ itter appear at the edges . it can remove noise peaks and is the recommended method for this .
save under and load : these buttons are used exactly for this . all the noise reduction parameters that you have set can be saved to the file system and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original picture is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) .
sometimes a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . fortunately , the solution to draw the image a little soft is fortunately much easier than blur@@ ring a picture . use tool for sof@@ ter with the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ ting sof@@ tw@@ ines and experiment with the smo@@ othing . the preview window on the right of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photographic art@@ ef@@ acts .
these filters for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos; noise , film gra@@ ining , scrat@@ ches , compression art@@ ef@@ acts and local errors appearing in digital , original or subsequently digit@@ alized images .
the same algorithm can be used for color and texture translation . the texture translation is done with another tool , the image error correction , and the algorithm for restoration was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG data arti@@ facts reduce : compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away from it . as a loss@@ less compression algorithm , it produces some compression &amp; quot ; Art@@ ef@@ acts quot ; - small standards that are seen in un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems .
the Save As and Load buttons make this exactly . any setting of photo restoration can be saved to a text file and loaded later .
photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take very long time to load a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time by pressing the button .
below you can reduce as a photo with uniform noise reduction restored .. The module is applied to a black and white photo that has been recorded with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ si camera to an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 Film with a Sensi@@ tivity of 3@@ 200 ISO .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time tex@@ tures have been reduced to an old color photo that has been scanned with a scanner . you can see the scan arti@@ facts that were caused by the scanner illumination and the photo paper . the original image is visible under ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
die &amp; digi@@ cam ; tool Hot@@ pixel supports hot@@ pixels of photos that were shot with a CCD camera gem , eight were used . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pix@@ i project , protected by copyright by Martin Dick@@ opp .
bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially for high @-@ quality raw @-@ mode photos , as many cameras with AF compression feature built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixels quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright pixel quot ; on a photo with a dark image sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
load this file in the wizard with the dark image button . the tool will automatically detect the hot and light pixels . these are highlighted in the image preview .
if you have an old digital camera it is important that you capture the dark image directly after connecting new hot or bright pixels with CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should load the appropriate dark image to the image to be corrected . automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels . note that the wizard re@@ members the last dark image and automatically loads it in the next session .
the image area and preview help you to correct the result within the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings . poor pixels are raised in all preview areas .
select an area around the broken pixels to preview and see the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixels . these are the available filters :
average : an average of the neighbor pixel is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels having a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , taken from a corrupt digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is shown below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , an image .
wide angle lenses , especially the medium and large photo format , can often not uni@@ form@@ ly illumin@@ ate the entire sensor range . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ ting wr@@ oth ; ( sh@@ aded ) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there . teleph@@ oto lenses may also show this behavior .
many center filters require a factor 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter , which makes it impossible to keep the camera by hand . wide angle lenses should , even with center filters , use an aperture of f / 16 or smaller , because otherwise the blur@@ ring effects are caused by movement .
with the large expos@@ ures of today &apos;s film and color or gra@@ y@@ scale depth of digital cameras and film scann@@ ers , it is possible to simulate the effect of a center filter by using an equivalent transformation on a raw image without this filter . the tool vig@@ net@@ ting correction transforms the transformation with a center filter to a picture . the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker .
with three controls , you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ting Cor@@ rection Filter and with three further expos@@ ures of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light absorption at the point of the largest density filtering . the standard density is 2.0 , which corresponds to an optical filter with an aperture setting of 1 , or by chance of a lumin@@ ous intensity of 2 , reduce it to compensate for a small degree of vig@@ net@@ ting .
lumin@@ ous intensity , contrast , and g@@ amma settings : editing an image with the vig@@ net@@ ting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels . you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . the controls only provide positive values , as you only need to increase the settings .
if you want a more fine adjustment of the exposure of the target image , leave the values for brightness / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ cam ; image processing from the Color Gra@@ dation menu .
this is an example of the vig@@ net@@ ting correction applied to one image . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vig@@ net@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image .
die &amp; digi@@ cam ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by David H@@ od@@ son .
this tool works with geometric distor@@ tions . color distor@@ tions cannot be corrected with this tool .
the coefficient of the second gra@@ dient deals with the general geomet@@ rical distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or conve@@ x shape of the image .
the coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect , but fl@@ atten@@ s at the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the coefficient fourth gra@@ dient correc@@ ts the remote corners opposite to that of the second gra@@ dient . if you combine these two , any geomet@@ rical distortion can be almost eliminated .
in general , this value controls the sever@@ ity of distortion 2nd degree . negative values can be corrected with tension @-@ shaped distortion and positive values cushion distortion .
corner : this value controls the strength of distortion fourth . this value is stronger at the edges than in the middle of the image . for most lenses , the &apos; Corner Par@@ ameters function has the reverse sign of the parameter general .
zoom : this value scales the image size and thus correc@@ ts initial gra@@ ding . larger negative values increase while positive image res@@ izes .
brigh@@ tening : this value adjust@@ s the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase it .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog with a preview shows the distortion correction . the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start .
the ton@@ - and cushion @-@ shaped correction should be performed before all tri@@ mming or size changes . best perform this correction as the first . if you re @-@ cut a picture and then perform a sound @-@ shaped correction the effect would seem obvious to the wrong .
to help you find the best correction , this tool will provide you with a vertical and horizontal aid line . move the mouse cursor in the image preview to display the dotted lines . move it to an important location , such as the sea edge or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . then , you can correct the ton@@ - / cushion distortion with the help of the lines .
if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove those with the tri@@ mming tool in the Trans@@ forming C@@ utting out of the Image Processing or via the Zoom slider of this dialog .
for most pictures the sound @-@ shaped correction extends . the next logical step for some motives , e.g. shots of front , frame and painting , it is the perspective to correct that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees . note that when holding the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective .
this is an example of the sound @-@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method for simul@@ ating the infrared film of the G@@ imp@@ anz@@ o.@@ org website which is accessible under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ infrared , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rec@@ tangle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the picture .
below the preview you can adjust two parameters set of film gra@@ ding and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . add the option Add movie gran@@ ul@@ ment if you want to simulate the gra@@ iny texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO regulator changes the amount of film gran@@ ul@@ arity and the domin@@ ance of color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in conversion . green meadows are white like snow !
because the filter bl@@ ends color channels for the reproduction of infrared film , especially the green channel makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos , as the color information is missing .
this is an example of the infr@@ a @-@ red filter effect applied to a landscape photograph from New Zealand . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values create a kind of aura in the pointed lights .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; filter film gran@@ ul@@ arity is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to reproduce film gra@@ ding on your images . this is known from classic high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films , manufacturers are mixing large silver grains of the photo emul@@ sion .
the film composition effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back into the past . the treated picture gets rid of a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , street photographic , gran@@ ular sight especially in your mon@@ och@@ rome photos , you need to use this filter .
the regulator can calibr@@ ate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although often higher values are required , set to ISO @-@ 24@@ 00 . if you need even more grains , you can apply the filter several times .
this is an example of the film composition effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that worked the ( 2 ) . the film sensitivity used corresponds to ISO 1600 .
the digi@@ cam ; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses an appropriate copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; Filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting . nature pictures and still life are good for this effect .
there are two controls to influence this effect . the upper one chooses the brush size between one and five . thi@@ cker brushes are better suited for large images .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original picture is marked with the ( 1 ) and the mach@@ ined is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 6@@ 40 pixel size picture is 1 and smooth 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; Filter Carbon Dra@@ wing uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a cab@@ bage sketch . images whose gra@@ dients vary slowly are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine which scene you had chosen to sketch out . these would be good pictures to start with .
there are two controllers with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper knob sel@@ ects the pin size and the lower adjust@@ s the contrast ( smo@@ othing ) .
this is an example of the carbon capture filter . the original picture ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; filter en@@ grav@@ ings shapes your picture in 3 @-@ D as if it was st@@ amped in wax . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; filter en@@ grav@@ ure is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with images with a simple structure , where color is not the most important of the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a grey , mon@@ dar@@ ing landscape .
the depth allows to set the contrast of the filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal picture into a work of art by distor@@ ting effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : divide the image into cells and make it look as if it is considered by glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : analog@@ ous to the wave blocks 1 , the image is distorted by a different version of glass blocks .
some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time by pressing the button .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of bl@@ ur effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom Fic@@ tion : blur@@ red the image along star @-@ shaped lines that eman@@ ate from a center point . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression that is often seen in sports photography .
radial blur@@ ring : blur@@ rings the image by rotating the pixels around a center point . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a rotating camera .
distance blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image to create the effect of un@@ focused camera lens . the object appears to appear in the background .
blur@@ ring : blur@@ ring the image by horizontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train taking photographs , camera .
blur@@ ring blur@@ ring : blur@@ rings the image smoothly into the dark and strongly in bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or adding a warm and subtle glow .
sharp@@ ness sharp@@ ness : blur@@ rings the image by means of random displacement of the pixels and thus simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of an arbitr@@ arily moving camera .
intelligent blur@@ ring : finds the ink in the picture and wi@@ pes it without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : divide the photo into rectangular cells and then create it by filling with an average pixel value , new .
some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can cancel this calculation at any time by pressing the button .
the ra@@ ind@@ rops are a nice little tool to make ra@@ ind@@ rops on your picture . this gives it natural to your pictures a wet look . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm .
dropping size allows to change the size of the drops . since the drop@@ let size does not grow automatically with the size of the image it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fis@@ sur@@ es changes the optical effect of drops on the picture .
you can use the digi@@ cam ; image processing to keep an area free of ra@@ ind@@ rops . use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . if you then start the filter reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ fen , the area will remain free of ra@@ ind@@ rops .
this is an example of the Reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ fen Fil@@ ters . the original picture ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the processed image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can move it through mirr@@ oring or rotating into the correct orientation .
photo infl@@ ating is definitely one of the most developed tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality .
the big question is how can you infl@@ ate a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom in or guess the missing information ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm used here makes a good job . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . select to change size in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is shown below .
the tool for size change uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approximate the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small image with a better quality then try the tool for blowing .
many image editing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ine Inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; digi@@ cam ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo infl@@ ating was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you need to tell the tool how to change the size . these settings are available in tab New size and are listed below :
retained aspect ratio : if this setting is enabled , the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smooth@@ ed , because it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos; turbul@@ ence effect it must be set higher than 3 .
the Save As and Load buttons are used for this purpose . enlar@@ ging each st@@ unt for photo can be saved as a text file and loaded later .
photo infl@@ ating is very fast with what it does , but it can take a long time and load a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Finish .
you can see below an example for photo infl@@ ating by adding a small color image to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged image ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of linear expansion .
editing a photo is not only a frequently performed operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to put a picture together . to cut a photo , you just need to use the mouse to crop the rec@@ tangle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and drag@@ ging the rec@@ tangle . you will see this rec@@ tangle then while you move the mouse .
you can change the size of the area to be tri@@ mm@@ ed by drag@@ ging on the corners of the rec@@ tangle . you can create a new rec@@ tangle by simply drag@@ ging it with the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the cut , use the button The C@@ trl ; + X ( C@@ trl ; + X ) button . use the Save or Save File menu item in the File menu to save the newly cut photo .
in the preview pane , you can change the size of the rec@@ tangle by drag@@ ging the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog will be preserved .
in the tool After aspect ratio , you can specify orientation as high @-@ format or landscape format . in high @-@ format , always the greater value of the height and in the cross @-@ format of the width is assigned .
this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimet@@ ers , inches or any other physical size . for example , you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog , two buttons exist to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically .
at the bottom of the dialog you can use the Max . ratio button to set the area for cutting to the wid@@ est possible , depending on the selected relationship and orientation .
when you use the cutting tool the next time , these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation . the changed picture dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data will reflect the cro@@ pped image and not the original image .
the settings of setting help allow you to blend aids so that you can better put your pictures together . these aids are :
harmonious triangle : harmonious divisions are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third @-@ angels , harmonious tri@@ angles are a way to divide a rec@@ tangle with similarly harmonic tri@@ angles at the diag@@ onal .
golden middle : the golden middle is a division that on various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the blades of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all possible things that we feel as beautiful .
the golden division is the irr@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks who constructed your temples and pyr@@ ami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden division at all times when you put together your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number deri@@ ves from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; the resulting divi@@ der is 1 : 1.@@ 6@@ 18 the golden middle .
the golden center provides liquid auxili@@ aries when compos@@ ing a picture . these aids are listed below :
the Golden Spir@@ al will bring you closer to your goal for your photos . compared to the third @-@ party rule , the golden spiral generates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the picture . this type of composition results in the viewer &apos;s gaze on the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ rical visual flow in this way .
another rule is the rectang@@ les of the golden spiral , also called golden rectang@@ les . these rectang@@ les are used to create the golden spiral . it should give something that the eye is in the center of the composition . it can be a line or different objects . this something can simply be there without directing the eye , it will fulfill its task .
the golden tri@@ angles also derive from the gold spiral discussed above . their verti@@ ces are the center points of the sides of the golden rectang@@ les .
if you use gold tri@@ angles to break your frame , create an effect that is called dynamic symmet@@ ry by professional photographer . try to place your focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve otherwise .
the horizontal mirror and vertical mirror options can be used to mirror the harmonic parts .
with the Color button you can set the color of the guide lines . if you have an image with many colors and a high contrast , the help lines can be invisible . in this way , you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image .
the Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle .
when you make a photo then it happens easily that you do not keep the camera vertical or horizontal . this creates a picture in which things are rot@@ ated around an angle . you can do this with the &amp; digi@@ cam ; image editing and tool free rotation repair . choose to transform the free rotation and adjust the angle of the angle .
rotate your image with the slider angle . the values on this slide are indicated in degrees . with the knob pres@@ ets you can set the slider to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are displayed at the top right corner .
for your help , the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line . move the cursor in the image preview to position the two lines . after moving it over an important point of the image , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in previous section .
after having turned a picture you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to fix this is to use the function Transform@@ ers Cut out of the image processing .
an elegant way to cut the image is the automatic cutting function . select one of the following options :
the Anti @-@ Ali@@ asing option smooth@@ es the picture a bit after the rotation . but note the above warning .
all perspective transform@@ ations are carried out around a fixed point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview is then automatically re@@ comp@@ uted . on the right hand side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you to change the perspective :
new Wid@@ th : displays the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
angle at the top left : indicates the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : displays the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed zone .
angle on the left : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : indicates the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed zone .
after adjusting the perspective , the image is slightly wa@@ sted . for a single adaptation , this effect is small , but two adjustments generate a double that effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you have adapted the perspective you get unpleasant tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to clean this is to cut the picture with transform@@ ers cro@@ pping out of the image processing .
a horizontal sc@@ aling , for example , will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the lower part to the left . this is no rotation , the image is distorted . in other words , a rec@@ tangle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module about transforming sciss@@ ors .
rotate your image by using the Horiz@@ ont@@ al angle and vertical angle . if you press pres@@ ets , the angle will be reset to zero . a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be displayed to the right of the preview pane .
to your help a vertical and horizontal line are displayed . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the sh@@ elling tool to adjust your image .
after you have done the sc@@ aling , the picture is blur@@ red a bit . for a single sh@@ ear@@ ing , this effect is mostly negli@@ gible , but two sh@@ itt@@ ings generating twice as much blur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this .
after sc@@ aling , the picture has un@@ si@@ ghtly tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate them is to cut the picture with transform@@ ers from the image processing .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . the available formats therefore depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries are compiled . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ cam ; edit .
because of this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on your system . however , you will always find JPEG and TIFF under it .
this happens by means of file extension and comparison with a pre @-@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , it is edited and digi@@ ti@@ sed . you can change this list of file extensions to the &amp; digi@@ cam ; you can change it . in the configuration section , you will find more information about it .
virtually all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras allow you to select even the format you want to use . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ cam ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression methods to digital images . redundant information is reduced in order to save image data in a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there are better , smo@@ other than JPEG during the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s version can also be saved without loss when specified in the settings .
if you want to know more about the raw video format , you can read in Colour most helpful gu@@ id@@ ances in English from Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour . you can convert raw format images to JPEG or TIFF with the Ra@@ è image converter . in the config section , you will find further information on how to use modules with &amp; digi@@ cam ; .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; supports loading of raw images only with the d@@ cra@@ w program , which is included in &amp; digi@@ cam ; it supports more than 200 raw file formats . all supported cameras can be seen at the bottom of Dave Coff@@ in &apos;s web page . the table below shows a short list of raw data which was edited by &amp; digi@@ cam ; supported :
many digital cameras support recording short films . these clips are often edited in A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; digi@@ kam ; but is not a film editor and therefore has no built @-@ in possibilities to view or edit films . if you click on a movie file &amp; digi@@ cam ; the &amp; k@@ de ; use settings to play movies to start playback .
go forward to the previously visited album in the chron@@ icle . you can only go forward if you have gone back before .

K@@ IP@@ I module exports a number of images to a K@@ ML @-@ structure . K@@ ML files can be opened and displayed with Goo@@ gle@@ Earth .
if you change steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well if the initial contrast is already very good , then you can perform the first four adjusting with the module white balance .
many tools you need to edit photos have been digi@@ ti@@ zed and digi@@ ti@@ zed . your description will follow here .
all image processing tools such as sharpen@@ ing , sof@@ t@@ mark , noise suppression , re@@ focus , masks , etc ; . use a uniform dialog type that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you see &amp; quot ; texture apply ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar displays the status of the filter to the current picture . to the left of it allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
divide vertically without dup@@ licate . the left pane displays the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected preview pane .
split horizontally without dup@@ licate . the upper area shows the original and the lower part shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview pane .
divide vertically . the left pane displays the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
divide horizontally . the upper area shows the original and the lower to compare the effect of the filter .
&apos; mouse over &apos; style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in the preview area and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can switch on to display over and under@@ exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame to select the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the image and place it on the part of the image you want to preview . preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module are noted .
the Properties page displays the essential information about the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is grouped in the following sections :
photo Properties : displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photo . these data are from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can move in or out or hold it on the mouse wheel . press C@@ trl ; left mouse button to move around a square . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . of course , this assumes your images contain Ge@@ o data .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pal@@ ettes . the application can be used for editing color pal@@ ettes and selecting and nam@@ ing colors .
the pallets files installed by &amp; k@@ de can apply either to the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , they are in your Personal Fol@@ der for &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Settings and hot Custom color and last used colors .
in the palette , you can select from a list of installed pallets or browse the folders by files .
the cursor is shown as a line in the pallet view . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
the color is described below the palette view . here , the color name can also be changed .
it can also be used for sel@@ ections . to create such a selection , click the area next to a color to move the cursor to it . then move the mouse with the left mouse button pressed .
if the check box Use C@@ ursor under the button Color is enabled , the color is inserted from the color table on the cursor . the color is either inserted or over@@ written another ; depending on whether the over@@ write mode is selected . this mode can be adjusted by selecting the check box under Bei@@ m C@@ ursor .
a selection that was created as described in the last section can be used together with the actions Copy , Cut and Pa@@ ste .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the clip@@ board : for each color three values for the portions of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a new@@ line if another color follows . so if there are three numerical values in the clip@@ board , they can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ;
the colors in the palette and the color selection output can be drag@@ ged with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then find it in the color sel@@ ector on the left .
graphs are used in science , especially in computer science . so far there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program , which contains &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; contains , according to the program author ob@@ sol@@ ete &amp; X@@ 11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; -@@ Programs with only a few functions .
the &amp; k@@ graphs ; -@@ Project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ graphs Viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; graphs . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ Programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graphs ; displays graphs with all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; an . it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; k@@ ate ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of the graph in &amp; k@@ ate ; the graph is re@@ comp@@ uted and in &amp; k@@ graphs ; )
menu to open the graph in &amp; k@@ ate ; open or graph in &amp; k@@ graphs ; in a &amp; k@@ ate ; component to open
loading large graphs ( currently there are problems from about 1000 nodes and a h@@ ack to represent more than these nodes )
further required software : &amp; k@@ graphs ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program , which requires the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; for displaying the graph pres@@ upp@@ os@@ ed . in detail :
the main window displays the opened graphs , each in its own sub@@ window . initially , when you start &amp; k@@ graphs ; without starting an argument , the main window is empty as in the lower screen shot . in this case , the toolbar contains just the icon file and the ( empty ) list of last opened files . click the first icon to open the dialog file .
after you have selected one or more &amp; dot files , the main window looks like in the lower screen@@ shot :
as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the canvas . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special keys , left and right with pressed &amp; alt ; key ) ;
the zo@@ oming is restricted in both directions by a factor of 10 . below you can see the maximum size reduction of a graph .
if the currently in &amp; k@@ graphs ; loaded file has been modified by another program , the following window will be displayed :
you can choose whether the graph should be rel@@ o@@ aded or whether you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ graphs Viewer ; can also remember your decision , so that later the same procedure is done . if you want to change your decision later , you can use the menu item Pre@@ ferences col@@ d@@ viewer ; set up ... see also .
when you open a graph file outside a running &amp; graphic viewer ; instance open , and eg ; in the file browser or the command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; graphic viewer ; instance or to display the graphs in a sub @-@ window of the existing instance .
as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but also change it with the Setup dialog .
when starting the program , you can open all the graphs of your last session . again , you can save your choice as well as change later .
you can also specify how to split the graph to several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely selected .
if you use several pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come to a page should be fitted to this page , ignor@@ ing the aspect ratio . if you maintain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out by the respective sections of the graph .
page preview with one on several pages distributed graph@@ ene without header and with another font
the Er@@ ne@@ ut Load page gives you the ability to specify the behavior when a file has been modified on your hard drive , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically re@@ charge or ignore changes ) or let the program review each time .
when opening a graph outside a current session , you can set a default behavior ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) or determine that every time it is requested .
the session administration page gives the possibility to specify the startup behavior of &amp; k@@ graphs . you can set a default behavior ( open or not open the files of the last session or not ) or decide to be asked for each start afterwards .
the context menu , which appears normally with a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ N , opens up additional options :
here you can choose among various &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorithms . the entries as described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z are :
it produces hierarch@@ ical or lay@@ ered graphs of aligned graphs . the algorithm defines the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then attempts to produce as short edges and as few edge overl@@ aps as possible .
the &amp; Ne@@ ato ; -@@ algorithm is the standard for ung@@ eri@@ zed graphs . it produces representations in accordance with the spring@@ board model . the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; -@@ algorithm generates a spring @-@ spring model layout for ung@@ eri@@ zed graphs . it uses the fruit @-@ man @-@ pure gold he@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multi @-@ wire sol@@ ver for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graphs .
the &amp; Cir@@ co ; -@@ algorithm arran@@ ges the nodes circle according to the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cycli@@ c structures .
opens a dialog where you can specify a layout command which will then be executed by a shell . the command should accept the graph@@ ene file as a parameter , and render the calculated layout of the graph to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a layout command you can specify &amp; eg ; the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ algorithms give special options , or also change the graph with a filter before it is drawn .
determines the type of graph@@ ene ( directed or executed ) and applies the standard algorithm for each type ( dot ; for directed , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for non @-@ executed graphs ) .
if this setting is activated , the overview will be displayed if necessary . otherwise it will not be displayed and the positioning menu is in@@ active .
display the What is the mouse poin@@ ter . with this mouse cursor click on a &amp; GUI ; element to get more help to this item ( if available ) .
a list of changes is available at this address and in the file Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the base folder of the source archive .
&amp; k@@ graphs Viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that uses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tools for displaying . it requires the following program packages :
a special setup is not necessary to use &amp; k@@ graphs ; you will find more options in the Settings menu .
the main editor window is divided into five areas : the main toolbar , the bar for drawing tools , the status bar , the .@@ color palette and the grid , in which you draw the icon .
create a new icon . if the current file has been modified , you will be asked if you want to save the changes . after that , a dialog will appear where you can choose to create the symbol from a template or whether you want to restart from scratch .
re@@ stores the last one @-@ made step . if you do not have a step undo , this function is disabled .
inserts the clip@@ board contents as a new image ( if the clip@@ board contains a symbol ) .
set the current symbol in gra@@ y@@ scale . this can create colors that do not match those of the symbol palette of &amp; k@@ de .
does not change the symbol , but sets the current character color to the color of the dot on which you click .
the status bar displays the current actions . from left to right it shows you the x@@ - and y @-@ coordinates of the current pixel , the size of the current drawing area , the magni@@ fication factor and the current number of colors of the symbol .

the K@@ IP@@ I module displays images to read and save new images .
this module can be used to read and save new images from external sources . currently , two sources can be used :
scan images : use the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner that supports the San@@ e project or another source such as Video Stre@@ ams . for this to work you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and San@@ e installed .
when you open the menu item Pictures , a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer . select the source from which you want to get the image . you can also set the default source for the next time .
after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window will appear by replacing the default values duc@@ rr@@ h in order to select your image accordingly . watch the preview and adjust the area to your needs before you scan the image . the estimated file size will be displayed in the right , bottom corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual , you will find more information .
make sure the window is completely displayed as some settings may not be displayed otherwise .
after you have pressed the button , you have to wait until the scan is finished and the window to set the options of the target image appears . please remember that the BM@@ P type is not compressed and therefore creates very large files . you also need to select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create by saving the image .
you can create screen@@ shots after you have selected the Import &gt; Screen Window ... button . a window appears where you can set the different screen@@ shots :
select the complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
if all of your program window is selected , the calling program will disappear , so that you can view other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , you will read the currently visible work@@ space . if you have selected the complete work surface only the window under the mouse will be read .
the delay determines how long screen shot is waiting before it starts . if you need to switch to other work@@ tops , you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate .
after the screen@@ shot has been created , the dialog options for the target image appears with the options described above .

if you use the module for the first time you will be guided through the process of generating a token . it is used for your authentication so it is your ID to Fli@@ ck@@ r . a browser is started so you can log in on Fli@@ ck@@ r .
after the successful registration , the module can send photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r website . you will be presented the following page after a successful login .
simply close the browser window and return to the program . once you have pressed Yes , you will get the dialog to upload photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r . this will be shown in the next section .
when the export module is launched to Fli@@ ck@@ r for the second time , you will be greeted with the following dialog , which displays the current access permissions that the module displays . currently , you need write permission . the module currently does not support other permissions . you will be asked if you want to continue with these permissions .
the button to add photos should be pressed once after you have all other options set . with this button you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box . click on the O@@ k button to start up@@ loading the photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r server .
the Tags field can be filled with a comm@@ a @-@ separated list of words . these are added to the image as keywords during upload .
with the Public , Friends and Fam@@ il@@ lie options , you can set the access permissions to your pictures . by default , the photos are classified as private .
if you change the option Modi@@ fy the size of the photos before up@@ loading , the photos will be changed before up@@ loading in size . the size is taken from the value entered at maximum size .
the maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images . the size is changed in such a way that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Galerie @-@ Export is a tool for ex@@ porting your picture collection to a gallery server
the K@@ IP@@ I module Galerie @-@ Export has no documentation yet . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants in this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical localization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . geographic data is saved in the EX@@ IF keywords of the image and loc@@ alisation can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical localization provides tools for loc@@ ating images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in spher@@ ical coordinate system , which is used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , long@@ itude and l@@ atitude are used .
to cor@@ relate your pictures with geographical data you need a GPS track as XML file in the GP@@ X format . ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical loc@@ alisation cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected pictures with a GPS track .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu . the above @-@ to @-@ see dialog appears then . to allow a possible correlation between time and localization , you need to load a track file with GP@@ X file .
when the file is loaded , an automatic correlation is performed which indicates the coordinates in red . GPS track data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be rec@@ al@@ cul@@ ated by GMT . this can be done with time zone . set your camera time zone here .
setting for maximum time deviation is an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera time . if the deviation is below , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you have no track data from a location for images , you can manually edit the GP@@ X file and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all images in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ate and difference in minutes can be used if you don &apos;t have the right data . if you know that in reality a location is located in a great time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the button cor@@ relative to inter@@ pol@@ ate .
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful if you have made a number of photos in the same place . as the dialog opens the coordinates from one call to the next , you only need to use the button OK to put the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found and set with the displayed map . select the region and zoom in . choose the region and enlarge it again and again until you have achieved sufficient accuracy . the height must always be manually selected . the card can be switched between card mode , satellite image and mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are possibilities to attach the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that uses the exi@@ ft@@ ool to provide a pile of pictures with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery is a tool for ex@@ porting a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums in a gallery of HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded UT@@ F @-@ 8 to enable the best possible internation@@ alization .
the tab has four tab@@ s in which the settings can be adjusted . the tab selection allows you to select all the albums that are to be exported to HTML . the albums are not displayed hierarch@@ ically . with the three buttons on the right you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below , the album preview and the text that appear in the header of the HTML page will appear .
this tab is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . if you click on a picture , a new page will be created in which the image is displayed . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your standard image viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show ,
the tab defines the settings where and how the gallery is to be stored with all your associated images . select a folder on which you have write permission . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export that contains everything will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original pictures will also be stored in the new images .
with other color depth you can change the default color depth . this , of course , also influences the file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the thumb@@ nails will allow you to customize some of the settings from the album tab for thumb@@ nails , which are small images that are displayed in the gallery .
a progress window indicates the user how far the action is . press Cancel to cancel the process .
if the module has created the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore read the programs to determine if errors occurred during production . the web browser will automatically start at the end to preview the gallery . press C@@ lose to close the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I Image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool to view images .
the K@@ IP@@ I picture viewer allows you to view a selection of pictures and to perform basic operations such as rot@@ ations , zo@@ oming or shifting . the viewer can be used with short@@ com@@ ings and past@@ es . he has been developed for quick image display and quick access to his functions .
after the start , a picture is displayed in full screen mode by default . this can be changed to a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ less Module is a tool for changing images without affecting your quality .
this module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions below , without the usual loss of quality or metadata .
the consequence of loss @-@ free storage is that the file size increases as no compression of the color information takes place . for example , this can also be found in PNG format .
the K@@ IP@@ I digital camera client is a tool for connecting your computer to a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants in this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module metadata editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the Import function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . then select the image you want to copy in the main program and then call the Import function . this then opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image , so the image to which you want to copy the metadata .
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not write into any target format . JPEG is supported in writing . please look at exi@@ v2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG encoding module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slideshow .
the MPEG encoding module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video with a defined length . this module uses the M@@ jp@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck packages . you can also add an audio file in the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slideshow .
all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . additionally , you can select a background color for slide show . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
first you need to select the images to be packed into the MPEG slide show . after that , you can create the module via Tools MPEG Sli@@ deshow .
the images you selected are then listed under image files in the portfolio . there you can also change sorting of the images or the contents of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should adjust the other settings . the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you plan to play the file on a TV , you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is default and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds that will display a picture . the speed of the image transition is specified below . a low value generates very sudden , a high , very smooth image change .
the background color can be set next . in doubt , you should let it black . the name and path of the generated file can be set in the Name of the MPEG output file .
if you specify an audio file in the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . once you have adapted all the settings to your wishes , you can use the encoding button to start generating the movie . depending on the speed of your computer , you can now go to a coffee quickly or in peace and enjoy the slideshow when you are back .
if a note appears that enco@@ ders or tools are missing , you can customize the paths to the programs of the M@@ jp@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck packages via the Settings link at the bottom .
the Printer Wizard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be opened automatically with the image image Gim@@ p . this is e.@@ g : useful to improve or print with the Gim@@ p module for direct printing .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format into one of three formats JPEG , TIFF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from him is : do not expect from d@@ cra@@ w that it generates the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get with d@@ cra@@ w better results ! .
first select the RAW file to be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w Image Converter window will then appear in the mode for a single image . with the Pre@@ view button you can view the effect of your current settings on the image .
you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option decides if the camera settings are to be used for the white balance . the main parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue amps can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the image later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected to allow you to use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switch has no effect .
once you are happy with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the file name stays the same and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a loss@@ less algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
the Tag@@ ged Image Format , TIFF , retains all the information of your image and uses the loss@@ less LZ@@ W compression .
if you plan to edit your pictures frequently or later reuse them later , you should not choose the JPEG format , since it only allows a limited number of operations before wor@@ sen@@ ing the image quality . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you select JPEG as a storage format , the metadata that is contained in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the Ex@@ if information .
if you have adjusted your settings , you can start the conversion with the Run button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use Cancel .
the batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at once . therefore , use this mode if you are sure , e.g. by testing on a single image , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images . however , they have the possibility to over@@ write existing files automatically . however , this is useful if they were created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion has progres@@ sed .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the score and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album .
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package .
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in one dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically , depending on the image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : res@@ izing in two dimensions . here , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option e.g. to customize your image to screen size .
non@@ proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
printing Pre@@ par@@ ation : prepares the image for the photo print . the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , edge size and background color , is adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected pictures with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the pictures appearing before .
after which you started the module , the pictures window will be shown with the pictures you selected . you can add more images with a file selection dialog . for the last selected image a preview is displayed on the right .
you can also drag and drop images to the picture list to add the list of images to be sent .
with the Copy button the selected pictures will be removed from the list of pictures to be sent .
after you have selected all the images you can open the New Message window of your e @-@ mail client with the OK button . you only have to add the addresses and the subject . the pictures you have selected are attached as attachments .
make sure not to send too many pictures at once . most email accounts have restrictions on the size of emails to be sent . it may be a good idea to send multiple emails when you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending images . your configuration is saved and used every time until you change it .
select your email client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below .
if you use the Google Mail Service , you must first install the G@@ mail Agent on your computer . you can download it here .
after selecting comments in a attached file , comments on the images are added to a text file and sent to the mail .
the PNG format under the File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to loss@@ less formats such as TIFF . therefore , you should use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise we recommend the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG in JPEG format and are the original files in JPEG format , then the original Ex@@ i@@ if@@ data will be added to the pictures to be sent .
when the process is ready , the window will not be closed automatically so you can view the status noti@@ fications , searching for errors , but your e @-@ mail program will be started automatically at the end .
after starting the module Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au a window with questions like you want to show your slideshow appear . you can choose between the albums you selected and all the pictures of the album .
the Open@@ GL Output option in the presentation enables very elegant image transitions by Open@@ GL . however , you need to have a corresponding graphic card , otherwise the slide show will be very slow .
the Display file name indicates that the filen@@ ame of the images will be shown in the left lower corner during the presentation .
the loop option ensures that the presentation is displayed in a loop . you can then manually inter@@ rupt it with Es@@ c .
the option of selecting images random@@ ly ensures that the images are displayed in a random order . thus , the order of the images is not used in the album .
the distance between the pictures can be set between the pictures . 1500 milli@@ seconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transition effect . so you should check this before you show your friends !
there are over a dozen transition effects between which you can select . random@@ ly , any transition between images sel@@ ects another effect .
during the slideshow you can access a toolbar at the top left edge of the screen . move the mouse into this corner around you .
with this toolbar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and the next image and stop the slideshow .
at the left lower edge of the screen you can see the current filen@@ ame , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Time &amp; Date has no documentation yet . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants in this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool for placing an image as background image for the desktop .
this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub @-@ menu , as a background for your K@@ DE desktop .
once you have finished your pictures and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations , you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; Browse through these , see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the image , now in each group , so in persons , places and in the group keywords are available .
in the browser window , you will see the categories for which you entered information when you provided your images and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations . additionally , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , view the folder structure on your hard disk and of course view the current preview images .
if you press the mouse over the entry , the view of the browser changes . see the image .
if you select another person only the images on which both persons can be seen . using this selection method , you can limit the number of images displayed by a few thousand images to a few single images .
if you have selected all the people , locations and other settings , you can view thumb@@ nails to view the images in your area of action .
in the picture every person has the same icon in front of her name . you can use a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person you can save your own thumb@@ nail , which of course also applies to locations , keywords and other categories you have defined .
to display pictures in addition to the names , select the button located on the right side of the toolbar . in the appearing context menu , you can select which view you want to use for each category . this has the advantage that you can view , for example , symbols with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you don &apos;t have the right images for your keywords ) .
however , you have to choose which image to display for each individual . to do this , you will need to open the image view window ( in more detail ) and select the item Editor &apos;s entry in the context menu . now , you can customize the image for the respective person . in the view window , you can customize the magni@@ fication factor according to your wishes and select which portion of the image should be displayed or cut off .
when you access the search in the main window , a dialog appears that is very similar to the dialog for setting the picture properties . you can view this dialog once more on the picture .
if you enter a string in the Label or Description field , you can also enter a date to search for ; the date can be either a part of the total date , i.e. , for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options at the bottom of the window you can search all the images according to specific names as you can see in the picture . here is shown according to images on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene .
this is the user manual for &amp; photo@@ album ; . if you don &apos;t like to read manuals , but prefer to try out functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and watch the quick entry , the screen@@ shots and the introduction videos .
start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and in the first dialog , select the demo , in case you start &amp; photo@@ album ; for the first time , or choose the menu entry k@@ photo@@ album ; demo . then , some sample images will be loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; photo@@ album ; try .
if you prefer to print this manual , find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coher@@ ent HTML document to download .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; view the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar can be seen here : . as the name suggests , this bar displays you data statistics on the images in your database .
the tim@@ eline can display several different time units . each bar then displays a different unit . you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by displaying the bar only 10 minute sections .
the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can change the displayed entries preview view from the database ( when you select a date , the first image will display this date in the preview window ) and also the tim@@ eline displays the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in the preview view .
you can also select a section of tim@@ eline by holding down the mouse button and drag@@ ging the mouse over the ruler of time bar , so the time data . if you select an area , you will only see images of this period in the preview view . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a tim@@ eline bar .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; provides you with two options available to create HTML websites with your pictures . the one is in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other available as module ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual is described in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version , which you can create via the menu File HTML ...
before creating HTML pages , you will need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and target . in the following , each area is described more precisely .
first , enter the title of the title and a description that will contain the HTML file later on . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML example pages will see an example of these settings .
next select whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; -@@ Export file is to be created which is to be seen on the overview page . you will find more information about the export files in .
finally , you can select which information to display on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid that information is displayed , which are obvious to the viewer without a description . for example , all images are from a party . note that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; currently all images are exported . therefore , you can not use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers .
in this section you can define how the HTML pages are to look like . most settings are unique , which is why they are not specifically addressed .
at the bottom of the page you can set up different resolutions for the images . thus , those who look at your website and have a monitor supporting the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , do not download images , which for example have a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewers of your site can change the resolution at any time you specified . so you can search your images with low resolution , leading to a lower transmission time . if you want to see a larger image larger , it changes to a higher resolution .
in this setting , you specify the different folders and the URL where your site is stored .
the best way to select a root folder for all your HTML files and a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set .
first you need to select the main folder in which all your images will be saved . this folder will be saved and added automatically next time . this allows you to select the location for all future images . here you can select either a folder or a protocol supported by K@@ DE , for example :
after creating your images , you can check that they are really all visible to viewers . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser after the pages have been created , will start . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder , you need to manually copy them there . to enable the import function , see , properly you need to specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located .
the settings that have just been described have changed all three to base folders and URLs . in them , a sub@@ folder is created , whose name you specify in the output folder .
if you are on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; photo@@ album ; together , you might want to create an HTML page for viewing the pictures . however , if you have spent a lot of time applying the image information , people on the pictures , recording location , etc . then you have to do with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this work will not do this one more time .
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database . the image properties are imported with ex@@ - and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or if there is only one link to images in the file . the advantage of saving all images into the file is that you have all the images together and that this file can pass so independently . however , the obvious down@@ side is the file size .
you can either ex@@ porting a .@@ k@@ im file directly from the File menu ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file scans the images in two ways . first , it scans the images that are located in the .@@ k@@ im file . if the corresponding pictures are not found , the images of the URL you specify when creating the HTML files are searched . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using HTML export .
the following is a dialog for ex@@ porting images , which you can view via the File Export menu ...
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three choices are available :
you need to copy the images in the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
copy &amp; k@@ photo@@ album automatically to the .@@ k@@ im file with the option Automati@@ cally close the .@@ k@@ im file ; the images automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal zip files . as most images have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it &apos;s usually not worth comp@@ ressing the files . if you want this anyway , simply select the Export file option .
the last option of this page is to limit the maximum image size . if you send pictures to your friends , you might not want to send the pictures in full size , because the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very large . for example , you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide .
if you import a file with the suff@@ ix .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File menu ... select , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in it .
the Import Wizard consists of four steps . first you need to select which images you want to import , then in which folders the import images should be copied .
it can be that you are the category people of the file to be imported ( if you are a domain ) while this category is called people . therefore , in the third dialogue window , you will be asked which categories of the file to be imported , and which categories these are in your database .
in the fourth step you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database . an example of this can be seen in the picture .
it has to be easy to browse and view images : if you see pictures , you often want to jump within different picture groups &amp; m@@ das@@ h ; for example , if you see pictures of your Italy vacation and discover a picture with your friend on it , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is pic@@ tured .
in this manual , you will go through the various steps of ( 1 ) establishing information about your images , about ( 2 ) browsing and watching , up to ( 3 ) advanced themes and custom@@ ization options .
K@@ Photo@@ Album has been started as a program for managing your pictures . however , it has been expanded and today it also takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual is talked about pictures , but often this also includes videos with one .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; saves all its information in the index@@ .x@@ ml file in the top folder of your images . this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. normal backup tools , copy to a disk or re@@ visions in CVS , where you want .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; re@@ members the folder in which your images are stored and automatically use it again in future starts . if you want to read another folder tree with pictures , you can start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; with the -@@ c option . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / Pictures / index@@ .x@@ ml .
via the menu entry settings k@@ photo@@ album ; set up ... you can get to a window with which you can modify the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the User Manual the various settings are explained .
on the left you can see six different symbols that allow you to preview and view the options for the viewer . for each setting there is a detailed help available which can be accessed by pressing the F1 key and clicking on the option you want .
it describes how you can set different properties for each picture , e.g. people , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums .
see the dialog used to edit existing groups . for each existing group you can select a label and a symbol .
in the section , sub @-@ categories have already been mentioned . in the Options dialog you can set up complete member groups , i.e. , for example , all members of a group at once in a group rather than all groups of a member as explained in .
in the selection list above you can select the category you want to configure . in the left part of the window is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub @-@ categories .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; shares its modular system with other graphics applications , such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; image plugin interface .
modules can and will not be described in this manual as they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , most modules have a help page that you can access via the module itself .
since the modules are used together by multiple applications each other , it may be that the modules with a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; only very little tested . therefore , you should always test new modules with the demo database before using them with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ demo &lt; user@@ input \ &gt; or via the menu Help . don &apos;t say I would not have warned you !
the applications that use the modules via K@@ IP@@ I are very different , making it possible that some modules with &amp; K @-@ photo@@ album ; do not work . this is the disadvantage if you share functions with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; photo@@ album ; and other applications that use K@@ IP@@ I is that the other applications will arrange their images in albums : an album is simply a folder . even if &amp; photo@@ album ; this kind of order does not support , it simul@@ ates the order after albums for some modules , so that you can use the functions with a photo@@ album .
previ@@ ewing &amp; photo@@ album ; the current album , which simply corresponds to the current view , so all the images that the picture preview currently shows .
in addition to the current album , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the modules also have a list of albums . here is a photo@@ album , as follows :
if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser displays the content of a category , for example all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module .
or it will use the category you have set in the Settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . so if you use the category people for example , it will do &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so do , so whether you have selected persons to view and share it with the module .
since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . then start the setup dialog and select modules which want to load modules .
on the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start &amp; photo@@ album ; start with your own ima@@ gery .
as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , you can see a menu and toolbar at the top . under the toolbar , you will see the window that you can browse your image database . in the section we will return to this window , but click on the picture to show you an overview of all available pictures .
one of the main functions of &amp; photo@@ album ; it is possible to provide any image with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this includes information about the persons who are shown on the picture , etc . you can set any picture individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time . if , for example , is illustrated on all pictures of Jes@@ per and all pictures taken in Copenhagen are included .
all these comments can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section . if you want you can see these comments if you are using the built @-@ in viewer .
see three lists with a text box by setting people , locations and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as you can use them again and again when you type information about your images .
the following idea is to post@@ p@@ one the images in the list : for example , if you have a family celebration and the same 5 @-@ 10 persons are shown on all 50 pictures , you can , by the fact that the names used are moved up , find the people faster and arrange them .
if you prefer to get an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the Sor@@ ting button below the list .
if you have selected ann@@ ot@@ ations for each image individually , you may want to edit all the selected images and add these images with ann@@ ot@@ ations . in this case , simply click the front and back buttons , which are located below the thumb@@ nail on the upper right corner .
if you have added several images , e.g. with the same person , it can be more convenient to mark all these images and to use the menu item Sever@@ al entries at once with a comment .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA . San Francisco and Los Angeles are also located in California .
in the picture you see a browser window that shows the USA as an over group . to show you that it is an over group , a special symbol is displayed .
in the Comment dialog &apos;s context menu it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new one or sub @-@ category . in addition , you can also drag an entry into a category and drop it there to make it sub@@ category of this entry . note , this pres@@ upp@@ oses that you just sort your categories alphabe@@ tically .
you can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and drag@@ ging the bars forming the top edge of the frame . you can also make a separate window from a frame by drag@@ ging it outside the window area .
if you have adjusted the appearance of the window so to your needs that you are satisfied with the settings , click the Options button ... which offers among other things the possibility to store the current structure and appearance of the window .
you can also completely hide a frame . if you want to see this window again later , use the Options button ... and then window / hide window . this is shown in the picture .
if you choose to display images in your browser , you will get an overview of preview images of the currently selected images , or all images if you do not have a filter . an example of this can be seen here . you can configure the size of thumb@@ nails by simply drag@@ ging the mouse with the middle mouse button .
if you drop an image on the background of your desktop , this image will be set as wallpaper for your desktop .
once you click on a picture , it will be displayed in the picture viewer . if you have not opened a window with a picture viewer , a new window will be created .
you can also delete pictures in the preview pane . simply select the corresponding pictures you want to delete and press either the Rem@@ ove button or select Del@@ ete from the Edit menu . now the window will appear that you can see in the picture .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; provides you with a solution for this problem . you can use a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , namely images , without saving you to the hard drive . of course you need to store the images somewhere , so that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can view the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all required images can be downloaded from the hard drive .
images in which the right upper corner is cut off are not stored on the hard drive . for example , the thumb@@ nails are available , so &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can view the preview of these images . however , you can not view these images with the image viewer .
as you see , this function requires you to copy files from the folders and then copy it back into . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so if you want to avoid annoying how to avoid merging your images , please buy a larger hard disk to store all images on it .
in the Pictures menu you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , filter the images in such a way that at the end there are those who wish to make you in@@ accessible for others and click the Current View menu in the privacy menu . alternatively , you can also control all the pictures that your little sister can see , and choose the menu entry All except current view .
with this , you have specified which images should be hidden in the case of the case . if you now give the laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu entry Add images , so that all the images you have locked can be hidden . if you want to get the pictures again displayed , click Un@@ lock .
it is also possible to specify a password which must be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply choose password in the privacy menu .
please bear in mind that this picture @-@ protection is by no means very secure . on the one hand , all images on the hard drive and on the other can read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection is only for those who use a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not very familiar to for@@ bid the view of private pictures .
the reason you spend all your pictures with &amp; photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours over hours with it is natural that you want to view them at some point . for this reason &amp; photo@@ album has an image _ and video viewer . you can start it from the preview as described in .
you can see the viewer in the picture . of course it shows the picture , but additional all the information you have entered the picture , such as who is on the picture , when and where it was made , etc .
if the info box on the upper part of the image you want to see , you can easily drag them with the mouse and disc@@ ard somewhere else . you can also configure which information is displayed and whether any information should be displayed at all . all these options are available right click on the viewer .
if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all the pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had selected persons from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have multiple images loaded in the viewer , you can switch between them before and after by using the buttons image high and down . you can jump to the first and last image with Pos@@ 1 and the end . these functions can also be reached from the context menu .
if multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as slide show . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then load a new image after a few seconds . how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing C@@ trl key and plus or minus . started and stopped the slide show by pressing C@@ trl ; S .
a very useful feature of the viewer from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is it able to switch to full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the full screen on the screen . just use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back .
if you use the viewer you can zoom in and zoom in . to zoom in , you can simply drag a rec@@ tangle with the mouse . with the minus key , you can zo@@ oming out in the middle of the image . shows how a zoom @-@ rec@@ tangle is selected and displays the result of the zo@@ oms .
with the dot key , you can reset your zoom so that the image is not zo@@ omed . with the unit key , zo@@ oms , so that every pixel on the screen matches a pixel of the image .
note that the only zoom @-@ operations that work with videos that are in and out with the plus and minus key are .
with the functions from the context menu you can rotate the image . this does not work for videos . you can make comments to the current image with the menu item notes from the context menu .
if you look at pictures it may happen that you can find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture . at the moment you can view the Cancel and Configuration dialog of the image to enter those names . however , you might prefer to select only the image and view more pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the images developed on paper . to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the images and mark them as good or bad as you look at one by one .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to tag pictures with features while you view them . characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can put a mark in that you press the corresponding letter . in , you see a picture where characteristics A , B and C are set .
as soon as you have attributes to your pictures , you can see them in your browser . so if you have all the images you edit , print or whatever you have selected , just add them all at once with ann@@ ot@@ ations . then you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do .
categories and special features can be displayed in preview view . if you display categories in the particular preview , then you can add features to the images by simply clicking the character for the attribute after the image was selected . you can see this :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . in this case , you allow &amp; photo@@ album ; to paint on the picture .
the batch is not stored with the image , but in the database . in this way , you can undo your painted later .
in order to enable the painting mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; switch on the painting from the context menu . to finish the painting simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you need to use the program &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; not fully control , but the documentation to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; should you have read and understood .
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is shown in the wire model views yellow .
you can also select multiple objects simultaneously . but not the object of an already selected object , since all sub @-@ objects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object into the object tree , select the position on which you want to insert the object and click either on the toolbar icon or select a menu item in the In@@ sert menu .
if there are several possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu is displayed to enable you to select the correct position :
you can delete selected objects from the scene by del@@ eting either from the menu bar under Edit or from the right mouse button context menu .
if you have changed properties , click App@@ ly to take these changes . if you have entered invalid values , a message will be displayed with an error description . then you can correct the input errors and then click App@@ ly or disc@@ ard the changes with Cancel .
if you enter the path to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; -@@ user documentation in the Setup dialog , you can call the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; -@@ Reference to the displayed object .
you need the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation .
when you edit a texture or part of a texture you can see a preview in the property view .
press Pre@@ view in the properties view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture . as default the whole texture is rendered , even if you want to render a sub@@ set item . if you want to render just a part of the texture ( for example a texture inside a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , tick the locally .
the screen shot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is selected , the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by drag@@ ging with the mouse inside the entire window .
each object has a level of visibility as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the level of visibility of the parent object or as absolute value . objects are displayed only when they are selected or their level of visibility is smaller or equal to the level of visibility selected in the toolbar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are displayed left and the four graphical views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the standard window arrangement or if you need a different arrangement , you can set it as you like . you can also store multiple window arrangements and simply switch between different configurations .
to anchor a window over or below a present view , drag the switch to the top or bottom of a view . a rec@@ tangle then displays the new position .
to create a new column , drag the tra@@ cker to the right or left side of a view . the new view will then be anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height .
if you want to arrange multiple views over one another , drag the An@@ f@@ asser in the middle of another view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the map leader at the top of the views .
the last possible window arrangement are floating views : views that are not anchored in the main window . to solve a view from anch@@ oring , drag the An@@ f@@ asser on the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing left in the interface bar .
to close a view , click on the small cross in the fas@@ cia bar . to prevent the closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross .
you can insert additional views into the main window . in the View menu , you will find entries for any kind of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them at any location .
the current window view allows you to save the window arrangement ... store it . a dialog is displayed where you can save the window arrangement under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene , you can render them . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program must be properly installed . as this manual was written , &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 date . this version is in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 does not support .
to render the current scene , click on the Ren@@ dering icon Ren@@ dering icon in the toolbar or select View Sc@@ ene menu entry .
a rendering mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and the quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different frame sizes and quality levels , you can insert any number of render modes , from a quick preview to full images of the highest quality .
if you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar , or select R@@ ender Mo@@ di on the View menu , the following dialog will be opened :
each render mode has a name . you can enter any name , but useful is a name that lets you recognize the properties of the mode .
in the map size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to render only a small area of the image , select the check box sub@@ section and enter the image excerpt for rendering to the input fields .
in the combination field quality you can select the properties , the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; used for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex @-@ diff@@ user retro @-@ illumination . a detailed description of the rendering features can be found in the user manual for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; .
if a picture is rendered with only one ray per pixel , various errors can arise . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or step effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than one pixel in the representation .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the impact of these errors . generally , pictures with this feature are better off .
if you switch on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , comp@@ utes and links &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; more than one ray per pixel . this technique means super @-@ sampling .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . the default is an adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tively because the super @-@ sampling is the adjacent pixels with one . the second method is adaptive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sively because each pixel is separated again and again and adap@@ tively because the recur@@ sion depth depends on the calculated color values .
if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray pursu@@ es a ray per pixel . if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels crosses the specified threshold , then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you set the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated , with a depth value of 5 then 5@@ x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays each pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : r 1 , g 1 and b 1 the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then :
diff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays each pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels , which are separately pursued and tested for further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of recur@@ sion can be adjusted with the depth value .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the production of noise for the jet process called J@@ it@@ tering . if you turn on J@@ it@@ tering , changed &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the beams around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the final setting for the quality of the render is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; which calcul@@ ates diff@@ use light reflection . it takes very long to let a scene comp@@ ute with this property .
on this map you can adjust whether the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is transparent if the associated beams have no object .
opens a new window for the Po@@ v@@ ray display ; console output . if &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly finished , you can find the reason for it here .
to import a &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray , select the Import menu entry ... and select a file in the dialog box .
currently , &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er does not support the full command set by &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; if error messages or warnings occur when im@@ porting , a dialog window displays a list of all messages .
if you don &apos;t want to support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; im@@ porting , write this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ R@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ R@@ w@@ End .
you can drag objects from the object tree into the editor to export the source text for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray . this adds the source code of the object into the open text file in the editor . to import objects into the scene , simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree .
with copy and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can paste source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; also .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; a scene rendered . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
if you click on Help in the property view , opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; user documentation on the displayed object . here the path to your document is supported and the version is supported . versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 will be supported .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example height @-@ field data ) in paths to the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you also need to enter the path to these files here . if a file appears in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used to display the selected control points .
the color of the rec@@ tangle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type labels .
you can set the object catch of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . you can here set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rot@@ ations .
larger values make a more accurate wire model and thus a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time to render . for some objects such as the ball , you can set the detail level separately for two directions .
when you tick the High level of detail for extended projections , all wire model views are further divided if the camera uses an extended projection . extended projections are all projections with exceptions of perspective and vertical projections . this feature results in better approxim@@ ation for projections , but requires more time to render .
when you tick wall , a wall behind the objects is rendered . the wall is represented in a chess board pattern consisting of two adjustable colors .
when you tick the bottom , a floor below the objects is rendered . the floor is represented in a chess board pattern consisting of two adjustable colors .
if you tick the edge smo@@ othing option , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . you can set the values for depth and threshold values in the R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di section .
on this page you can change existing Window arrangements or create new window arrangements . in the Window Environment section it is explained how you can create and save windows orders .
the combination panel Standard window arrangement : displays all available window arrangements . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the selected window arrangement when starting the program .
the list Exist@@ ing Window arrangements shows all available window arrangements . a new arrangement allows you to create with the Add button and delete a select configuration with the Del@@ ete button .
each window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list below the name displays all views for the selected window arrangement . new views can be created with the Add button and Del@@ ete selected views with the Del@@ ete button .
the new column allows you to create a new column on the right side of the existing windows , with Un@@ ten you will anchor the window under the existing window , with flash card you will receive a map view together with the previous view and floating suspended the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you just have &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; inst@@ alls and now you want to start without exact knowledge of both programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a sphere at one level .
but you should observe the following warnings before you complain that as a result you only get a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should follow these important rules :
if you do not set a camera , no rules for rendering can be applied , as a result you will get a black image .
if you do not insert light sources , your entire scene is in the dark and you only get a black image .
if you have installed everything without errors , see the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following pre @-@ set window arrangement :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing symbols of the toolbar . please read the documentation so that you get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and symbols right now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application .
to follow this guide , first you have to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the Edit menu item , so you now have a scene without objects .
the wire model view shows how the camera looks at the whole scene you generate . in particular , you notice that in the fourth wire model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the perspective of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry called camera . when you click on it , you can see the contents of the object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; for further details .
do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera has control points with which you can change the point of view of the camera . simply click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired position .
pressing the button or pressing the Enter key will immediately change the wire model views and the object tree according to these settings . as a result , you will see the scene from the camera &apos;s point of view .
there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . you might , for example , insert a box ( inser@@ ting fin@@ ite bodies ) and the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a convenient method to solve this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; it actually provides a simpler way . you can use an infinite plane as a base :
a good advice : select the layer in the object tree , change the name and press the App@@ ly button or enter the Enter key . in the Object Tree the new name will be displayed immediately .
the wire model view now shows the level as well , although at the moment only as a fin@@ ite ending level . if you render the scene , the plane extends to the horizon .
when you look at the object tree exactly , you will notice that you can fold the item for the floor when you click on the symbol + in front of the object . in this case , you will only see the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation , and shift .
in this scene , you should move the floor to the exercise unit under the horizontal line just to get to know some of these parameters . select Shift and set the values as follows :
first select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but select something simple at the moment .
in both cases a dialog opens , in which you can choose how the object should be inserted . please select First object . the pigment will then be displayed in the property tree . you can change the name in the property view ( name = bottom @-@ pigment ) , with a click on the Pre@@ view button you will see how the pigment looks now .
of course , the pig@@ ments preview only shows a matt black material because you still need to check the pig@@ ments for the pig@@ ments . please always remember that you can preview the look of materials at any time by clicking on the preview .
if you don &apos;t see a color on the he@@ aders and the ball in the preview , just click on the App@@ ly button and then click the Pre@@ view button .
the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you render your image now with a click on the symbol , you should get the following result :
in the color list you have to enter two new attributes , called Uni@@ coloured . in the object tree you have to enter the entry color list . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this more often , but the ch@@ ess@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
in the object tree always select mon@@ och@@ rome and change the colors in the view of the object properties :
this step you should already be able to do , since you should have already understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; the ball can be easily created just as easily as the ground :
in the view of the object properties you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( do not forget to press the input button or the knob user ) , so the sphere has contact with the ground . otherwise , the sphere would float above the ground as you have shifted the ground around one unit down@@ wards .
of course the rendering now results in a strange result : as already seen before , the ball surface appears like a matt black material . in the following step , put a suitable material .
if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as already with the ground , give the ball a pigment as color :
select First object and change the name for example in Ball Pig@@ ment . click on the Pig@@ ment button , then select Uni@@ coloured and set the values as follows :
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some Finish Properties :
then change the values as shown in the following screen@@ shots and click App@@ ly or press the Enter key .
the brightness effect and reflection already result in good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces even when metallic : not yet selected :
you should now have a good impression of what options are available to you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; hopefully you have already learnt so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
ra@@ y@@ trac@@ y@@ cing is a rendering method to create a two dimensional picture of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
when you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ing a scene , the rendering of hypo@@ the@@ tical rays moves from the viewer &apos;s perspective ( i.e. from the camera , rendering the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene . the render calcul@@ ates how this ray is reflected by the objects and how atmospheric effects such as fog can affect .
as you can imagine , you won &apos;t see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene . without a light source , you don &apos;t see anything , the picture is simply black . obviously , every scene needs to be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . Po@@ v@@ ray files usually have the extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the default file dialog , you can select a file you have previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it will be stored in the same name . if it is a new file , you will need to enter a name and a disk space .
re@@ stores the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage has been dis@@ car@@ ded .
this menu entry can only be selected if you have not already saved any changes in the scene .
repeat the last executed command . this menu entry can only be selected if you have used Edit back .
saves the current window arrangement and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing layout .
in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the look , short@@ cut and default behavior .
opens a dialog to change keyboard short@@ cuts . you can use this option to set default short commands for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; change commands or add new ones .
opens a dialog to set up the toolbar . you can use this option to add and remove tool icons for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; commands .
a B@@ ump @-@ Map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to model any b@@ ump on the surface individually and to change without the geomet@@ rical shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for both a b@@ ump map and a texture map .
basic elements are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are created out of dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then further mach@@ ined to give them a more realistic look .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel basis using an image file as a color card .
&amp; ku@@ ok@@ ick@@ show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select images to view .
images can be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
use of &amp; ku@@ ok@@ ick@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can use with clicks of the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the Return key .
you can specify whether each image should be displayed in a separate window , or whether all images should always use the same window .
if you are looking for a specific file , simply type the first character of the filen@@ ame in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the right lower corner . if a matching file name has been found , the file will be highlighted . you can exit the input field by pressing Return or Es@@ c .
in the Set@@ ting &amp; ku@@ ok@@ ick@@ show dialog , there are five cards . in three of them , General and Edit and Sli@@ de Show , you can set the working method of &amp; ku@@ ok@@ ick@@ show ; in the other two , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , the keyboard short@@ cuts can be specified for the respective windows .
if this is selected , the images will be opened in full screen mode . if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display surface is filled with the background color you can adjust further down . pres@@ etting is not full@@ screen mode .
this point is activated , loads &amp; ku@@ ok@@ ick@@ show ; already the next image in the folder , while you still watch the current picture . this reduces the delay if you choose the next image , and is particularly suitable for a slideshow .
with this option saves &amp; ku@@ ok@@ ick@@ show ; when moving the name of the last opened folder . at the next start &amp; ku@@ ok@@ ick@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
click on the colored bars to select a background color . it is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in win@@ dow@@ ed window the window is larger than the image , the background is filled with the selected color .
you can &amp; ku@@ ok@@ ick@@ show ; set up that only some of the file types will be displayed , which can also display the program .
this option increases the display window to the full screen for large images . this option is enabled as default .
determines whether the slideshow should start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right of the input field . the default is 3 seconds .
if this value is set to 0 , the slideshow will be repeated until it is abor@@ ted by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right of the input field . default is 1 .
change the short@@ cut keys here for the various operating modes of &amp; ku@@ ok@@ ick@@ show ; in the flash@@ cards short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser .
with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ piece view of the file system with folders and files in one window .
displays large icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
shows preview images for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
reduce the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
increases the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
closes the display window for the pictures . &amp; ku@@ ok@@ ick@@ show ; will also be closed when no browser window is open anymore .
show the picture in original size . this is only useful if automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
opens the input field for completion . enter the first characters of the filen@@ ame you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected .

&amp; show@@ photo ; is a project supported by a community . that means that users and developers can help each other . if you are a common user of &amp; show@@ photo ; if you are a common user of &amp; show@@ photo , then we would like to answer you here questions to other users of &amp; show@@ photo ; however , in this mailing list , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful in this language .
the best start to participate in &amp; show@@ photo ; to participate , it is the developer mailing list to join . instructions for joining the developers mailing list of &amp; show@@ photo ; .
and show@@ pictures ; try to give you so much control of its work@@ flows as possible . there are many options that modify the behavior of a show@@ photo ; to access these settings , you need to set up the setting dialog box ; you can switch between them by clicking on the icons on the left side .
in the area of exposure indicators , you can select the color displayed when the under@@ - resp@@ . exposure indicator is selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity should contrast the colors with what you want to display . under@@ exposure should indicate a light color and over exposure a dark color .
the main window of &amp; show@@ photo ; has a side@@ bar at the right edge which provides you with important information and actions for the selected pictures . you can also find the same page bar in the image processing . you can view it in which you click on one of the five tab@@ s :
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an application to scan images that no longer makes to scan and save images .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application to scan images that no longer can scan and save images . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; can open a dialog for saving or save images instantly in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format . the user can also view the images before saving .
you can check the status of your scanner &apos;s support on the SA@@ NE project page by entering the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; with the command sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner is not opened , or if no standard scanner is specified , a dialog will be opened to select the scanner .
the user can select the scanner to use and press OK to open the scanner . Cancel will quit &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; quit .
the other settings include more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not treat these options in particular .
in order to scan a picture , the user can only start a pre @-@ scan and then scan the scanning area for the final scan . the preview can be started by the Pre@@ view button .
in order to better select the image , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom in such a way that the full preview will fit into the window .
once the image has been selected , the final image can be read with the scan button .
if Before saving a preview in the settings selected , then the image will appear in a preview window as shown below . when saving is pressed , then the image will be saved and Sch@@ lie ? en will lead to a demoli@@ tion and you will get back to the main window .
the Settings button opens the dialog with the same name before the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can view the image if wished , before saving . in this case the option must be selected Before saving a preview . if this preview is not wished by the user , the option must be checked .
this option allows you to select the type like &amp; sc@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; save images . open dialog for saving each picture opens the dialog before each image scanned . if &amp; sc@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; this is automatically saved with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you need to select Save without asking for a file name .
this setting defines where the images are saved in the Save time option without asking for a filen@@ ame . if the images are saved after each scan , then this folder will be used as default for the dialog for saving . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ...
this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for automatically storing images and is also the suggested name for the image in the dialog for saving . the automatically stored image gets a num@@ eric suff@@ ix that is always displayed up when a picture is stored . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
the user can adjust the image quality used for saving . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if select the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the Help button launches K@@ DE support with the &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the About launches the K@@ DE About dialog for &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; the Settings button displays the dialog for settings and closing can be used to quit &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite .

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; use like all other keyboard short@@ cuts . below is a list of the short@@ cuts and their function . the global keyboard short@@ cuts can be set by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window and selecting global keyboard short@@ cuts . you can set the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ specific keyboard short@@ cuts by right @-@ clicking in the player window and choosing short@@ cuts ... Select .
you may need to set existing multimedia keys to work as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ Sh@@ ort@@ cuts . this way you can make your keyboard to the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center .
Amar@@ ok &apos;s D@@ CO@@ P interface has many general functions , most of which can be found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P features of collection , context browsers , players , play@@ lists , play@@ lists browsers and scripts .
Amar@@ ok supports the command @-@ line options from Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; in addition , Amar@@ ok has some own command @-@ line options .
you should give the user feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a lack of dependen@@ cies . please check in your script if all required modules are available and use a check@@ box to allow the user to know why a script does not work .
Beg@@ in require &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um &apos; rescue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bin@@ dings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings V@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit end
in the scripts / templates folder you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as the base for your own scripts or simply add them to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively easy .
using D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command , which should be included in any K@@ DE installation .
most scrip@@ ting languages are used to execute external programs and commands . for this , the function ex@@ ec ( ) is usually used . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be inv@@ oked relatively easily . here is an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends messages to all running scripts . for this purpose , scripts should be written to the standard input of the script . for this reason , scripts should constantly monitor their standard input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script may also ignore events when there is no use for it .
configure sets the script to display the setup dialog . in order to save and store the setup data , each script must take care of itself . when a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the working folder to the folder where all data should be stored .
tra@@ ck@@ Change signals that a new piece is played . the script could now ask for more information about the new piece using D@@ CO@@ P functions ( for example the metadata or the piece length ) .
Volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ Volume sign@@ alizes a change in volume . the new volume is an int@@ eger between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le paths includes the path to the selected files of the playlist , if a custom menu entry is cli@@ cked . to add an entry , you can use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script add@@ Custom@@ Min@@ u@@ It@@ em ( Sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) . to remove an entry , use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Min@@ u@@ It@@ em ( Sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) .
before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; termin@@ ates , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed , for example , to perform clean @-@ up operations , such as saving data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks script management can also install scripts that the user &amp; z@@ b has downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) , which can optionally also be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the creation of amar@@ o@@ script . for this reason , you should correctly name your script packages right away .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file permissions :
when your script package is ready , you can upload it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the Wi@@ ki script page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; scripts .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and is still surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can simply drag music into the playlist instead of having to work through endless menus . you may also search for a very specific title from thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s Coll@@ ecting Browser and Quick Search you will find the piece within seconds .
you might have already some play@@ lists , but can never decide which ones you want to hear ? then the playlist browser is exactly the right thing for you . and if the decision is still difficult , the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to specific criteria .
Amar@@ ok has excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers if@@ p and many generic USB devices . besides , many different audio systems can be used , so YOU can choose how you want to listen to your music . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right thing to re@@ discover your music !
usually , in the base folder of the Amar@@ ok sources , you have to enter the following to compile and install Amar@@ ok :
da &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake use , you should not have trouble when comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report them to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; like most applications , has some options that you can enable or disable at compile time with the configure script . this is a list of available options .
some of the compile options need to be filled with certain dependen@@ cies so that they can be used . details can be found in the system requirements section .
activ@@ ates de@@ bug@@ ging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help develop &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should use full .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without any effort using the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several flash@@ cards to set up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
when the player window displays , the player window switches to the playlist in addition to the playlist . if the option is off , only the playlist window will be displayed .
use the tuning bar@@ ometer : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for mo@@ od@@ bar . this option activ@@ ates the experimental function of the tuning bar@@ ometer .
design : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for mo@@ od@@ bar . this changes the color scheme for the mood bar@@ ometer .
files stored in the music files : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if enabled , .@@ mood files will be stored at the location of the corresponding music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files will be stored in the Settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; usually ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / mo@@ od@@ bar / ) .
external Browser : lets you choose which browser from &amp; Amar@@ ok should be started when a browser is needed .
use the other browser : here you can specify the path to another browser , which is not in the list above .
save Play@@ list when you exit , save the current playlist automatically when you exit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; check this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the running playlist upon exit .
relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : when you enable this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to music files , starting from the location of the playlist . otherwise , the absolute position of music files is stored .
keep up @-@ to @-@ date pieces visible during play changes , so that the playlist window will pop up / off to keep the running piece always in the visible window area .
changing to context browsers automatically indicates the context browser as soon as the next piece is played .
in the Ap@@ pear@@ ance section , you can customize &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s Ap@@ pear@@ ance . the section is sub@@ divided into three parts .
in the fonts section , you can set the use of different fonts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; by selecting Properties fonts , the otherwise gray shown section will be enabled . you can select Writ@@ ing for the following range : playlist Window , Player Window and Con@@ text Browser . click Select ... , so you can select a font from the selection dialog .
with the Custom color scheme , you have the choice of choice and can set your own color scheme . to do this , use the color sel@@ ections that are activated for the foreground and background color .
resume playback when start , that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after program start , resume playback automatically with the piece at the point where it stopped at the last stop .
set the On @-@ Screen Display window allows you to switch on the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display is used , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly .
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select the font for the O@@ SD from the dialog . the check box shadow causes the text to be sh@@ aded in the O@@ SD .
using your own colors gives you the option to customize the O@@ SD color for font and background . clicking on the color surfaces opens the dialog for color sel@@ ections . if the colors are not activated , the default colors will be used .
the Display Text input field displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering wild@@ cards , the O@@ SD can be adjusted to your needs . below is a list of available space holders and what they mean .
the screen option is intended for X@@ in@@ ama users . this allows you to specify which screen of a multi @-@ monitor environment the O@@ SD is to appear .
the card card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop @-@ down box . some drivers also activate other settings in this card card .
the card collection is used to set all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and the type of database for the collection .
here you can select the folders , the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for music files . to include a folder in the collection , select the check box next to its name . this section also includes check boxes to set how to proceed with the selected folders .
Browse sub@@ folders recur@@ sively : this causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both those inter@@ sec@@ ted as well as their sub@@ folders will search for music .
monitor changes : enables &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folders to changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . in addition , an incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection .
import play@@ lists : causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; add all found play@@ lists to your collection folder ( .@@ pl@@ s- and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists will appear later in the playlist browser .
the Part Coll@@ ect Database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination field driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , further configuration is required in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l sub@@ window .
the My@@ S@@ q@@ l setup section is used to set up the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; under calcul@@ ator : if the host is located on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . after that , the network port is entered in which the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is established .
use User@@ name : and Password : to enter the data you need to connect to the database .
the flash@@ card last@@ .@@ f@@ m direc@@ ts the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations regarding current play if necessary .
here you enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you do not have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
send played pieces and update the profile : this setting makes it possible &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
call similar performers : after activation of this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a list with similar interpre@@ ters can be retri@@ eved from each piece played . note : you do not need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this function .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
Amar@@ ok only needs the package k@@ deli@@ bs and no other K@@ DE packages . you must have k@@ deli@@ bs thus installed ( including the included programs , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide on how to compile k@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
some features , such as the O@@ SD , require that your window manager stops the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work , for example . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , therefore we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , as these provide an excellent development environment .
you can locate the file by typing in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also app@@ end the broken file that caused the crash .
it is mostly because Tag@@ li@@ b crashes when reading the met@@ a @-@ information from this file . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for it in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is somewhat more mature .
make sure that all of the libraries used by &amp; Amar@@ ok have been compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if , for example , Amar@@ ok ; with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b was compiled with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , this leads to crashes when processing met@@ a information .
if you use K@@ DE with ar@@ ts@@ d then de@@ activate automatic . turn off when in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or at least do not use a value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace via email ( the email will automatically open during a crash ) . if this is a frequently occurring crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error is guaranteed .
this is because many programs write data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 into the met@@ a @-@ info but do not mark it as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; The file $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b ; my $ mp3 &#91; 0 &#93; ) ; print &quot; Error in writing the tags of $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; unless $ mp@@ 3 &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , stamp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ;
this script needs the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b . it can be re@@ installed with this command : Perl -@@ MC@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b &apos;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( Rand@@ om Mode / Re@@ petition / Dynamic Play@@ list ) are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes the symbol effects are easily forgotten . in some cases , you can click on a symbol in the Control Center . note that in some cases you have to click on a symbol for up to three times until this setting shows its effect .
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ side : symbol look@@ up error : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , then check if Amar@@ ok uses the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos; which amar@@ ne@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
to fix this error , you may need to remove any conflic@@ ting Q@@ t version , or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok will find the correct version first .
most installation problems are most easily solved by an expert in your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help with other users or developers . use the forum and I@@ RC under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ o@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ ok .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please enter a bug there if you have something to fix an error in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; just a blank playlist will appear . how do tunes get there now ?
this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
to keep the interface intuitive , the startup sub@@ window has been converted to the Statistics window . you can find it under Extras Statistics .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for the rating by the user while the points are automatically calculated .
to evaluate pieces , the rating column must be displayed in the playlist ; click on the title bar of the playlist and choose column Show review . click anywhere in the new review column to specify the rating for a piece . you can also use the Sh@@ ort@@ cuts Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove and then press Del on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your choice and then select From Play@@ list Rem@@ ove from the drop @-@ down menu .
drag a playlist file with the mouse into the playlist and let it drop there , just as you would do with other files . it &apos;s as simple as that : - )
in the toolbar of the playlist , right next to the Add button , the playlist button is saved . click on it .
probably the program x@@ m@@ ms @-@ config is missing . install the x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . also look for lib@@ Como , this package contains many very nice visu@@ ali@@ zations .
the equ@@ ali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . you can also find it using the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
none . yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses a back@@ end independent approach , so the actual issue must be loud speaking media types supported G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ K ? . as you see , we support pretty much any imagin@@ able audio format .
it can ! perhaps use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which in default no MP3 deco@@ ders are provided ( for patent reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat &apos;s mp3 tag , Enter key
start the Ya@@ ST Online update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . well ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos;s : - )
if you are using the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa sink , the device must provide a bl@@ ender . a mixer enables multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously output audio . this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware bl@@ ender ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( software bl@@ ender ) .
the output of this command should help you find the cause of the problem and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer you may need to provide a different sink ( eg os@@ se@@ sink ) .
that does &amp; Amar@@ ok ; already . don &apos;t forget that media must first be deco@@ ded . you can &apos;t just send a MP3 to AL@@ SA , you would only hear a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , deco@@ ding it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
X@@ M@@ MS also de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . enable sound servers with highest priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that ar@@ ts@@ wra@@ pper SU@@ ID is set :
in K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ L co@@ dec@@ s that can cause disturbed playback . read this error report . enlar@@ ging the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help well .
either do not use the Arts Driver , but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia to get the faster Arts Co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been strongly optimized for Analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less vig@@ our react the visu@@ ali@@ zations . yes , this is an error , please help us fix it .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crashes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; off . why ?
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you need to register all components . list all components to register all G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask the I@@ RC Channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer .
try this ( quit Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then perform all ff@@ m@@ peg files in the G@@ Stre@@ amer module folder ( you will find the module folder with you @-@ config / G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run it again . start now &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
if you have a complete list of suggestions / wishes , please send them to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album by the British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very much and I think that the name sounds good . in addition , the name contains the magic K ... : )
thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . put an alarm in your calendar program and execute with the alarm this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play
this command lets &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playback . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before going to bed , then you will have wo@@ ken by the soft tones of the music you have stopped before bed@@ time .
how to get the current in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; running titles if you &apos;re on another computer ?
if a working SSH environment is present , you can proceed as follows . this command will give you the interpreter and title of the current unit : SSH -@@ i ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ username Amar@@ ok player now@@ Pla@@ ying
replace IP address with your IP and username with your username . this assumes your identification in file ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa is present .
the visu@@ ali@@ zations can be separated from the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; window . click on the keyboard and the current Analy@@ zer will open in an independent window in size .
the combination of C@@ trl + Right mou@@ sec@@ lick represents a piece in the sequence of clicks into the queue . pressing the enter button after a search in the playlist will play the first search result and reset the search .
OK , the player window and playlist have tri@@ cky features , but what about the icon in the Control Panel &apos;s system section ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; click with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ MB@@ N &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button on the title of a browser . in the context menu you can select which browsers are to be displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my Personal Fol@@ der $ HO@@ ME is on an NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok , the collection database cannot be created and many error messages appear on the console . what now ?
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you have to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok to a local drive , or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support .
insert the CD , then click Play Audio CD from the menu . it opens a file browser with multiple folders . for normal reading , switch to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a Kon@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic encoding , instead , take files from the folders mp3 or og@@ g .
Q@@ Str@@ ing@@ List values = query ( Q@@ String ( &quot; SE@@ LE@@ CT play@@ mate , cre@@ at@@ ed@@ ate , &quot; F@@ ROM statistics &quot; &quot; W@@ HER@@ E ur@@ l = &apos; % 1 &apos; ; &apos; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( escap@@ e@@ String ( ur@@ l ) ) ) ;
basically this fits the previous assessment with a dimin@@ ishing value , based on how often the piece was played . the more often the piece was played , the less influence each individual assessment has on the overall result .
you can enter the review for a piece by right @-@ clicking on a column header in the playlist window . then you can change the evaluation of a piece just as all other attributes , namely by clicking with the right mouse button on the piece and editing : comment or pressing F@@ 2 . you can also edit the review in the Metad@@ ata dialog .
the developers do not want to tell you when to release a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a fixed fit plan that is not compatible with the short @-@ term plan of Amar@@ ok .
this is a new function in Amar@@ ok , which some users can find also ner@@ vi@@ g . de@@ activate the option icon when playing anim@@ ate in the General settings .
the Analy@@ zer is part of the toolbar . select App@@ ly Set@@ ting Tools ... and take the desired changes there .
download a design , or create your own . then install it under Amar@@ ok ... Ap@@ pear@@ ance Con@@ text Browser design , click Create New Design ....
the icon was too similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphics Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) . to avoid difficulties it was removed .
Kon@@ quer@@ or Navigation Section allows you to browse and control &amp; Amar@@ ok ; while browsing the Kon@@ quer@@ or . launch Kon@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 to view the navigation pane . then click on the Settings button ( top top ) and select Add Amar@@ ok .
the service is free and you only need a free user name and password .
if you want to use AL@@ SA then please the latest version available . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crashes and thus also a lot of bug reports .
probably &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before installing x@@ ine or g@@ Stre@@ amer . therefore , the . / configure routine did not compile these output modules . you have to configure &amp; install Amar@@ ok ; re@@ configure and install .
now I &amp; Amar@@ ok ; newly installed , but the output modules still don &apos;t appear . and now ?
you probably need to install the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ de@@ vel package . the same also applies to x@@ ine , you need to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that you will have to re@@ compile and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel .
I consider the bug G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ IT@@ ICA@@ L * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. How can I fix this ?
your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer has been compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking , which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you need to comp@@ ress G@@ Stre@@ amer without P@@ rel@@ inking . a hint from mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : do not use L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS when comp@@ iling Amar@@ ok .
I receive the There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 , although the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ader is installed .
to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time module has to be installed next to G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad .
you get the error There is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
you play an MP3 stream , but the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ mad module is not installed . install the module and then run as System Administrator . then restart Amar@@ ok .
I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can I use Amar@@ ok the second sound card ?
under Settings Amar@@ ok ... Audio output enter the device . typically , for example , h@@ w : 0 for the standard sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here is an example for ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with an onboard AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
pc@@ m.@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type plug sla@@ ve@@ .@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 0 } c@@ t@@ l.@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } pc@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 0 } c@@ t@@ l.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
enter the us@@ b @-@ audio in the Setup dialog , and the output takes place on the USB sound@@ card . so @-@ li@@ b takes care of converting the sample rate , channels and so on ) .
if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , disable the check box in sound card supports m@@ map .
we are sorry , but the audio output with Arts is not being taken care of . you may , of course , gladly take this problem into your hand ! if you want , you can become the new so much needed care person for Arts : )
listen to music should be quite simple ! for this reason , there is the setup wizard , which is displayed on the first start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if you want to update your collection later , or simply do not like the wizard , then this Quick Start Guide should help you . with its help you will have created &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in a few minutes .
the small text box for filtering the collection facilitates you to search for specific pieces . if you are happy with the playlist , you can save it with the help of the button playlist and save it . you will find this button in the toolbar of the playlist .
if you have your own play@@ lists , you can add them to the playlist browser . if the playlist is in the folders of your collection , and you have the option to import play@@ lists , then you will already find these play@@ lists in the tree view . with a right click on a playlist , you &apos;ll get different ways to load the playlist .
to play an audio CD , select Ac@@ tual Audio CD from the menu bar . it opens a file browser with multiple folders and CD pieces in WAV format . simply drag the WAV files into the playlist and then press the Play button .
the audio CD function uses the protocol audi@@ oc@@ d : / and is not compatible with all available drivers .
the burn function is also available in the playlist . simply right @-@ click on an entry and follow the Burn menu . you have various possibilities to burn a CD .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires the installation of some software packages . the packages required are listed below . additionally , some additional packages are listed which make work with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; more pleasant .
if you install these packages via a package management system ( e.g. RPM or apt ) , you will also need to install the development versions of these packages !
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; it &apos;s a versatile multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . like any normal multimedia player , it also has &amp; Amar@@ ok ; however , a playlist that is superior to everyone else . the playlist window contains several browsers with which you can capture and browse your entire music collection .
this chapter explains how all the functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok will be used , including creating a collection and playlist .
the Player Window is your one @-@ click &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center . at the top of the window is a text display showing the current play or current stream . directly below is the area , the playing time , bit rate and sample rate of the current play . a click on this area changes the display of the already expi@@ red playing time for the remaining play time of the play .
in addition , the Player window contains a selection of audio analy@@ zers , even under the text display . you can switch by the available analy@@ zer by clicking the left mouse button on the pane .
the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press on your keyboard and the current Analy@@ zer will be displayed in an independent , magni@@ fying window .
the PL and E@@ Q buttons also feature the PL and E@@ Q buttons . the PL knob activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the playlist window while the E@@ Q knob is used to set the E@@ quali@@ zer .
the rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons , the volume control and the play position slider . use the slider to adjust the play position or volume . using the playback buttons , you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or previous piece .
the built @-@ in equ@@ ali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio drivers . there are 17 pres@@ ets , from classic to techn@@ o , and you can easily create your own pres@@ ets .
to view the equ@@ ali@@ zer , use Tools E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click the E@@ Q button in the player window . once you select the equ@@ ali@@ zer check@@ box , the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in operation .
the playlist of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most developed playlist for &amp; k@@ de ; available multimedia players . it has many features that do not exist in any other player . but don &apos;t let the fullness of functions deter them , they are all easy to use .
the play@@ lists window can be divided into two main areas , on the left side is the navigation area . in the navigation area , you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist , such as the context browser . the playlist is easy to use and yet even for advanced users powerful enough .
the context browser displays different information regarding the current play . its appearance can be adapted with the help of context browser designs . the context browser includes three sub@@ windows : music , text and performer . these three sub@@ windows will later be explained in detail .
if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you may notice that the sub@@ window has dropped off . the information presented there has now been distributed to other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in addition , the information can be viewed in the statistics window ( Tools statistics ) .
the music sub@@ window displays information about the currently running piece , as well as the interpreter and the album .
the first area in this sub@@ window displays information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , performer and album . below you can see the cover picture of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . click on this icon to see the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database .
you can find further information about the current play under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . you can see here how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its rating .
to view cover images in the context browser , the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece . the pictures may have any names , but pictures with the word front in the name are treated prefer@@ enti@@ ally . the context browser will also display cover images that are either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
the next section , recommended pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played immediately .
among the recommended pieces are the favorite pieces of this interpreter . this section shows the five highest rated pieces of the current interpreter .
you can set which information to display in the music sub@@ window . click with the right mouse button anywhere in the sub@@ window and select from the context menu .
the last section , album of the artist , lists all the albums of the current interpreter you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will work out and you will see the contents of the album .
you can click on all the pieces in the individual sections to start playing right away . you can also right @-@ click on it and then select one of the ways to add the play or album to the playlist from the context menu .
in the sub@@ window text the downloaded song text is displayed for the running piece . this function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other web pages by means of even written scripts . as soon as you click on the text sub@@ window , try &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to download the text for the piece from the Internet . if no text script is running , you can choose which one should be started .
the Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics . the modified version will then be stored in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s collection database . no running text script is required .
the search button opens a search on goo@@ gle@@ .com following the lyrics for the running piece ( in an external browser window ) .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t - only groups the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the interpreter . albums or genres are ignored .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / Album - first the pieces will be arranged according to the artist and there will be another distribution according to the respective album . if you want to see compositions or sound@@ track albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list among different interpre@@ ters .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / Jahr - Album - Sor@@ ted by Interpre@@ t and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the newest first ) . if the year for an album is unknown , the default 0 - album name is used .
group Album - All the albums of your collection are sorted alphabe@@ tically with each other . the interpreter is ignored .
group@@ ing Genre / Interpre@@ t - your pieces will first be sorted by genre , among them by artist .
group@@ ing Genre / Interpre@@ t / Album - This setting works just like the above , but is additionally sorted by album below the interpreter .
the remaining buttons allow you to customize and match the group@@ ing as you wish .
with the last button you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically re @-@ collect your collection once you change something to the selected folders . if you have many pieces , this might take a while .
a search filter is directly under the toolbar . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . hints for using this filter can be found in the section on the playlist in this manual .
there is a selection box under the search filter , with which you can filter the most recently added pieces to your collection . you have different time windows available , starting from the last 24 hours to a year . also , you can of course select your complete collection , whereby the filter is practically switched off .
by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the Collection Browser you will receive the following options .
load - This l@@ ends the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces to play in the currently valid order .
attach to playlist - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on an entry , you will achieve the same effect .
set pieces in queue - This function inserts the selected pieces into the queue . this will play you next .
save as play@@ lists ... - Save the selected pieces as play@@ lists . you will be asked for a name under which the list is to be stored .
assign to media player - Jo@@ in the pieces into the queue for transfer to the media player . for more details , see the section on the Media Player Browser .
burn all pieces of this interpreter / Burn to CD - The selected pieces are sent to K@@ 3@@ b and fired either as data or audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option is not displayed .
edit metadata ( for n pieces ) ... - open the dialog for piece information and let the tags change for one or more pieces .
( n ) Move the files into the garbage bin ... - Open a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer .
mark a compilation - Select the selected album as a compilation , resulting in various interpre@@ ters .
picking up a compilation @-@ flag - Chan@@ ges a compilation of selected albums back into a normal album . the album will then no longer be shown under various interpre@@ ters but again under the corresponding interpreter .
the playlist browser makes it easy to handle many play@@ lists . among other things , it also includes smart play@@ lists .
the lower part of the playlist browser includes the smart play@@ lists . they use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists at runtime . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played .
even created smart play@@ lists are possible . click Intelligent play@@ lists to open the dialog to create a new Smart playlist , where you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist .
the sub@@ window media player is used for connecting &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for example , to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to use for example your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod . if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; started , you will find the pieces on your iPod by Interpre@@ t ass@@ or@@ ted in the top list view of the Media Player browser .
to transfer tracks to your iPod , drag the desired songs from the playlist and let them drop on the list Interpre@@ t . if you &apos;re done , click App@@ ly . by doing this , the pieces will be uploaded to your iPod . when the transfer is completed , quit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; and release the drive connection for your iPod .
under the toolbar there is a search area where you can search for a file . the search is especially useful in folders containing a lot of files , because all files in the file list are hidden which do not match your search criteria .
in the lower part of the file browser is an address bar where you can pick music from a given URL . if you type tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musik@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z , you can access music in the file musik@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z . now you can drag and drop the music from there into the playlist .
if the playlist is longer than in the window , it can be difficult to attach files by simply dropping it . in that case , holding down the Shift key can be helpful : by doing so , dropping files will be automatically inserted at the end of the list , and not in the mouse position .
you can change the order by simply drag@@ ging the entries with the mouse to the desired position . as soon as you enter letters , you will only see the pieces that contain the letters . to reset the filter , press the return button until the text box is empty again .
if you enter search terms separated by spaces , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for entries containing all search terms . for example , if you enter one two three , the search will find all entries containing one , two and three .
if you type OR between the search terms , search for entries that either contain either one or the other search term . example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces are found that contain one or two or three ( or a combination of it ) .
if you want to search for entries containing spaces , then en@@ close the keyword with go@@ ose feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will be sought after entries made by Mike Old@@ field , but not for entries like Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you specify a specific search column , you can also search for larger or smaller ones . for example : rating : &gt; 50@@ . this searches for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific keyword , set a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something looks for pieces that do not contain anything .
for example : Mike Old@@ field OR Score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bad . this searches for all the pieces that either contain Mike Old@@ field , or have a higher rating than 50 and do not include the comment pool .
you can define the sequence of entries by holding down the C@@ trl key , and then right @-@ click on the entries . the entries then receive a label with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played .
the playlist of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist . on the left you will find the Add button that you can add to the playlist . to the right you find playlist , empty and Rand@@ om playlist .
next , undo and restore the buttons . this allows you to undo or restore changes to the playlist .
in the middle of the toolbar there is a unique , enlarged analy@@ zer . the refresh rate can be adjusted by clicking the right mouse button on the Analy@@ zer .
the last button in the toolbar is menu . it opens the same menu as the one you get in the player window via the right mouse button . via this menu you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos; s Configuration .
there are many more buttons available for the toolbar , such as playback controls and volume control . you can set the buttons displayed by clicking on the menu and set up toolbar buttons ... Select .
the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about the playlist . it shows the title of the current play , the number of pieces and the total play time of all pieces . in addition , the status for random mode and retri@@ eval is shown by clicking twice in the appropriate display area with the mouse .
you can also hide the status bar . to do this , disable the status bar option in the General Settings .
the context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking on the menu in the playlist . via this menu you can reach the settings of &amp; Amar@@ ok .
a click on this entry will open the window visu@@ alisation plug@@ ins . there you can select the Visu@@ ali@@ zations of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; select .
behind this entry there is a sub @-@ menu with links to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
the cover administration is a useful tool for managing your cover images . you can start it by selecting Ac@@ tions Cover management in the collection browser .
the cover administration contains a list view of all albums in your collection . you can view all the albums of an interpreter in your collection by selecting the performer on the left side .
with the View menu you can select what to display in the cover administration . select :
the queue management received your big move in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this function you have even more control over the playlist . after you have set a piece in the queue , the playlist will appear in the playlist . this number represents the order in which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the pieces will play : 1 is played first , 2 as second , and so on .
if you want to add a piece to the queue , select the piece in the playlist and then click + . you can also simply add the pieces with the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist . you can then change the order of the pieces in the queue management .
there are three kinds of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already pre @-@ set ( the details about how to set up these later ) .
fill your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and add more random pieces during playback .
add pieces based on Last@@ .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( formerly : audio osc@@ ale ) . this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist , so you don &apos;t need a Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to work with that dynamic playlist .
double click on the playlist you want , drag it to the playlist window , or right @-@ click on it and then select Load . in this way , your current playlist will be replaced by the new playlist .
the two pre @-@ set Mo@@ di Rand@@ om Mix and Play@@ lists mix immediately fill your playlist and you can start playback directly . the play@@ lists recommended pieces start with an empty playlist and you must add at least one piece itself from your collection . the recommended pieces will be added at the next play , so your playlist will be filled only at the end of the first piece .
if you want to keep the current playlist , enable the last possible dynamic mode : settings Dynamic Mode . this will use your existing playlist as a starting point .
the New Ref@@ er button emp@@ ties the current playlist and adds new pieces according to dynamic mode . edit playlist opens the dialog to edit the playlist , and you can change the appropriate settings .
right clicking on a dynamic playlist allows you to click Edit . then the dialog will open to edit the settings of the playlist .

played pieces - this is the number of pieces played that are to be kept at the beginning of the playlist , so you can easily see which pieces have been played recently .
this is the number of pieces that are to be added to the playlist after each played piece . if you click here more than 1 , the playlist will continue to grow , because only one piece can be played and removed .
the Settings on the right has already been described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialog , you can select from already existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you tick several play@@ lists , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; random pieces from each of the checked play@@ lists are added .

c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) . in the Internet these programs are generally referred to as ri@@ pper .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis Library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a fully open , patent @-@ free and professional audio encoding technology . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is benef@@ iting from open source and is in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by O@@ gg Vor@@ bis Dec@@ oder@@ - and En@@ co@@ der modules .
M@@ ad : this is a high quality MPEG audio decoder . currently it supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 decoder module .
l@@ ame : a far developed MP3 decoder that can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial enco@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 encoder module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source code for loss@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio encoder module , so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
Li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , ff@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ h@@ ack Decoder : other libraries for processing various audio formats . with ff@@ m@@ peg , it is possible , for example , to dec@@ r@@ yp@@ t WMA files to burn them to an audio CD .
SO@@ X : an utility that can convert and convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the So@@ X Audio encoder module .
Trans@@ code : a command @-@ line program for video processing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
V@@ C@@ DI@@ ma@@ ger : a fully equipped auth@@ oring system for editing , dis@@ assembling and analyzing video CDs and super video CDs .
norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard stage . for example , it can be useful for creating mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize , the different recording levels of the different albums can lead to the unpleasant effect that the music pieces are played differently lou@@ dly .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to run from CD and automatically play all the videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient method to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the corresponding sub @-@ menu contains a list of these projects . click on one entry to open the project .
save the current project . if the project has already been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new file name .
saves the current project under a new file name . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog Save Target is displayed by which you can select folders and file name for the project file .
saves all open projects . that &apos;s the same as if you would call for every single project file saving .
closes the current project . if a project has been modified and has not yet been saved , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what should happen . you can then disc@@ ard between saving and changes .
includes all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any un@@ saved project what to do with it , just as if you have called for each project file .
closes all opened projects and termin@@ ates &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; for every project that is not stored there will be asked what to do with it as if you called a file closing .
when you call this entry , you can select files to add to the project via the appearing dialog . it has the same effect as if you drag the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files will appear in the base folder of the CD .
opens the &quot; Burn &quot; dialog for the current project . this dialog is basically the same as the project &apos;s properties dialog . the only difference is the additional button firing , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; for burning the medium . the burning dialogue can only be opened if the project already contains data .
opens the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of them will be described via the What is it ? help ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry will only appear on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session to the current project . this is useful when you are not using files for a multi @-@ session CD .
this entry only appears on an active data CD / DVD or Video @-@ DVD project . this function causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to remove imported files from the current project . all other files will remain in the project . this function removes no files from the medium , it only hides the previously imported files .
opens the CD copy dialog . this allows you to copy a CD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can only create a copy of a CD , which you can then burn later . you should prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs .
alternatively , you can only create a copy of a DVD that you can then burn later . alternatively , you can also create a copy of a DVD that you can then burn later . furthermore , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of normal copying . furthermore , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of normal copying . furthermore , the target medium has to be large enough to accommodate the entire ( video ) data of the source medium in the original form .
opens the dialog for del@@ eting a CD @-@ RW . this allows you to delete the entire contents or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
opens the dialog for format@@ ting a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , so the contents will be completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the write modes over@@ write and incre@@ mental .
the dialog will prompt you for a * .@@ iso , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as data source , which can then be fired immediately by pressing the burn button . ( min@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported yet , you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burn a previously created DVD image . the dialog will prompt you for an * .@@ iso file as a data source , which can then be fired immediately by pressing the burning button .
a previously selected DVD video can be converted . this dialog window usually appears after reading a DVD in the Table of Content , but can also be used alone . it contains information about the selected video , encoding settings , and even options for modi@@ fying the size and cutting black edges .
this information is displayed in the table of contents and includes properties of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD .
displays a list of the toolbar of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is checked , the toolbar is currently visible in the main window .
when this is checked , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden .
the folder view displays an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives . if the table view is enabled , their contents will be displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info , locking and unlock the drive or ej@@ ecting the medium .
the Table of Content is also the interface for reading audio or video CDs when a drive has been selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view .
the header is a narrow section , which is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the header has no real function ; it only looks pretty , and clearly separates the project view from the rest of the views .
this opens a dialog box for changing the key assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the key mapping for it further down .
this will start the k@@ 3@@ b ; Setup Wizard . thus , the correct permissions can be set to burn CDs and DVDs . for this , system administrators will need to enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) when starting the wizard .
open the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here general application settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work immediately . this dialog is meant to person@@ alize and fine @-@ tuning the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . using this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled via a shell script , for example .
to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can either use the d@@ co@@ p command line program or the somewhat more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are function@@ ally identical , so your taste and the nature of your task is decisive , which of the accompanying programs give you the default .
in this chapter we assume that you can use the d@@ co@@ p command line program . to use the D@@ CO@@ P , you must make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; started . then enter something like the following on the console :
besides the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; -@@ functions that all &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program have in common , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts , which are described below .
the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface from &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides features such as copy@@ CD , format@@ ted DVD and other features for creating new projects .
D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Media ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Media ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) void ( ) void } void bur@@ n@@ d@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ d@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ d@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method , you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively you can create a project using the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then get a reference to the project using # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project . using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface and the high @-@ performance K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface , which can only be applied to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der void Q@@ String Ensemble ( Q@@ String Ensemble ) void add@@ ur@@ ls ( K@@ URL : : List ur@@ ls , Q@@ String Ensemble ) void Favor@@ et@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String Quartet ) void set@@ Volum@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String id ) void
this makes it possible to fill out a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and then inserts files into the new folder :
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT rest / home / tru@@ eg / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ Ex@@ trac@@ er for &amp; k@@ de ; . with it can easily be read audio CD ; s read out and saved in MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG files . also other formats are possible , depending on the encoder that is installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; files in wa@@ v files on hard disk ) and by many enco@@ ders ( compressed ) . currently l@@ ame for MP3 , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs and FLA@@ C ( loss@@ less compression ) is supported by default ( these coding packages may still be installed from the Linux distribution ) .
first , the tracks of the &amp; CD ; read out and stored in wa@@ v files on the computer ( loss@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step , these wa@@ v files ( usually one per cap@@ tion ) are compressed into the mp3 or O@@ GG format or even in other formats as the loss@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must be done now .
for the second step l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ ders must be installed , so it is probably not necessary to compile something yourself . however , only the enco@@ ders need to be installed that are needed . for example FLA@@ C will not be used , its installation is not required .
which encoding / file format is to be used ? the chapter Which enco@@ ders is a small introduction about enco@@ ders , audio quality and compression factors .
a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as already said , use &amp; col@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia for reading the audio data from the &amp; CD ; if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD device can handle the protection , it is not possible to b@@ ypass the mechanisms of copy protection . simply avoid buying copy protected audio CD ; s !
while setting up only once ( the setup dialog can be called up so often until a suitable configuration has been found ) , afterwards the daily use to read a &amp; CD ; this leads ( hopefully ) to the understanding of the lean approach of the user interface that you &apos;ll stum@@ ble across at the beginning .
can convert to many formats - depending on which coding programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; get information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the internet or can work completely without network , whereby everything is recorded manually .
this is just a short list of the main window commands . on the step by step example , you will find more information about how this program is used , as well as screen@@ shots with descriptions of the tab@@ s for the configuration of the program .
start the CD@@ DB request of CD data according to the setup of request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be local or online , in the latter case first the connection to the Internet must be established . )
start reading and - if an encoder was configured in the encoding settings tab in the Setup dialog - the encoding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of the En@@ co@@ der available so that the selection can be read with another encoder as the default . it must be noted that before the encoder was configured in the encoding settings tab in the Setup dialog .
opens the file manager so that an already selected file is selected for encoding instead of a full &amp; CD ; read out and code .
opens the setup dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as protocols , spa@@ des ) for program events ( such as reading the &amp; CD ; finished ) .
opens the master device dialog from &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with different flash@@ cards ( like enco@@ ders , to set up the encoder ) . here you have to go before the program can be successfully used !
this chapter describes sound quality , enco@@ ders and compression ratios and helps you choose the right encoder .
if no audio information is to be lost , a loss@@ less audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C , there are also other such as &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; available for this distribution .
among the audio formats that lose information through data compression depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common ones . O@@ GG today may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit rate the differences become less important as both enco@@ ders produce very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is provided free with most distri@@ butions but there are open license questions
+ High to very high sound quality ( at high bit rates ) , but lower quality compared to O@@ GG at lower bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music should be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG play@@ lists exists .
MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special car stereo systems . today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices mostly support only the MP3 format .
a short list of audio quality parameters and resulting compression ratios for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for more parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et Extreme &apos; = 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate approximately 5.5 . requires 25@@ k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate app . 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a song . good enough for music of young people , portable devices and aut@@ oster@@ er@@ o@@ ys . but not good enough for better hi @-@ fi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be over@@ done for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want to have the absolute highest quality regardless of the file size , then select this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information that is manually entered or downloaded by the program automatically from the fre@@ ed@@ b over the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can hand over / used with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; and the encoding program to create the folder and file name as well as the properties of the music files .
in connection with coding programs there is often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs .
for example , to add the &amp; CD title to the keywords ( English : tag ) if MP@@ 3@@ s are enco@@ ded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ t@@ t of l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; must be added . the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of the &amp; / or creator parameters ; parameters that can be used ( = button of the button in the Wizard ) :
this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read the audio CDs instead of entering the information instead of entering the computer . it must be noted that here only text is spoken : &amp; CD ; Tit@@ le , artist , name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( note of the translator ) is not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company can be har@@ med . all information can be obtained anyway with a stroll through a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtual .
in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is active to select a check box ( sending an address ) . for using fre@@ ed@@ b may be used with another ( counter@@ f@@ eit ) address than the one in the system . in this type of configuration , it seems , the email address is not used when retri@@ eving data from the server ( This may only be the programmer who has verified the code . )
there are in many countries copies of the main database . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; to use fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally the nearest mirror server should be needed . this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( typically created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which les@@ bian program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; to store in wa@@ v files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ors that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used for it ; who wants to know more precisely , search in source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; s . note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package from the appropriate distribution must be installed first if it hasn &apos;t happened yet .
for storing the read WAV files , the enco@@ ders and thus the desired file format can be selected . at the first opening there are pre@@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a loss@@ less compression for audio data ) on the tab to set up the encoding . other enco@@ ders can be added to this tab itself .
the coding package must be installed from the respective Linux distribution before the encoding can be used . this is also required for the pre@@ defined enco@@ ders . more information about enco@@ ders can be found in the chapter &quot; Wel@@ cher Codes . &quot;
after installing a encoder , you can get more information about its switches by entering a command like l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) .
this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , write and read real on it and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio enco@@ ders of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed .
check if you do not want a copy protected audio CD ; check the cover of the CD ; this will not succeed !
there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips on how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , understood all , but are somehow still uncertain what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , set it up and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps in average and ID@@ 3@@ V1 stit@@ ch keywords ( Tags ) .
there must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be available as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame may , for example , be found with a search engine , as it is considered as non @-@ free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can always do .
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have write permission ( eg by trying to copy something into the Kon@@ quer@@ or ) .
the first section discusses the basic setting of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; something that will probably only be done once and
the second section describes the procedure for reading a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for each ex@@ iting &amp; CD .
here we determine the enco@@ ders to be used for compression of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps ) . as we are la@@ zy , we share the program that fre@@ ed@@ b use to use the &amp; CD ; download data from the Internet .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not be able to modify them at any time when the appropriate settings are found .
the device name is passed to the reading program so that it can read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces .
often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available , a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the entries of the device names for the CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the card card General settings . here is not much to do . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example everything is loaded / typ@@ ed as shown in the screen@@ shot .
only with incomplete information will be selected , so that you will be informed if information about creating key@@ words ( tags ) is missing .
the card card CD ; -@@ Settings . just select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically download via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b calcul@@ ator .
note : the computer must be connected to the Internet during the reading of the CD , so that it can access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
the second selection box is simpler , a &amp; CD ; entry is found , immediately begins reading the &amp; CD ; this is associated with low risk , if you are later un@@ happy with the database entry and the resulting directory names / filen@@ ames or tag entries , they can be easily changed . the directory and file name will be changed with Con@@ qu@@ ant &gt; Ren@@ ame and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , please keep in mind : if you want to manually enter everything , de@@ activate the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b will not be used . however , this is more than 6@@ 20 MB , if you want to use the database before . however , if you want to use fre@@ ed@@ b in offline mode , the two selection boxes need to be selected , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following card card .
CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data request , for calling the &amp; CD ; information from the fre@@ ed@@ b server over the Internet . how does the system know which data the CD should get ? read the section about fre@@ ed@@ b .
mode : we did not download the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB server : please go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror server near you . on this way , the load is distributed between the hosts . however , this setting will work as the first attempt .
both work exactly as far as the server is concerned , but because many fire@@ walls bo@@ unce the 88@@ 80 protocol by default , there might be more luck with protocol 80 , because the HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet .
in this example we don &apos;t want a &amp; CD ; send data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . de@@ activate the first check box should be sufficient .
just take the settings from the screen@@ shot . ( make sure the folder / tmp is on your computer )
number of simultaneous plays : sorry , there is one reason why more than one at the same time with just one existing drive ? parallel reading and encoding ? the author doesn &apos;t know , so simply try it yourself .
CD ; after reading the last piece , check this to check the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process .
custom folders for temporary files : if you tick this , then / must specify the path / folder where the wa@@ v files are stored . if the box is not checked , the files will be created in the private folder . if you don &apos;t want to do this folder , if you want to make something with the wa@@ v files yourself .
just type as it is on the screen@@ shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something has to be smooth@@ ed to the right to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et Extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as already mentioned before , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good HiFi stereo systems . the resulting bit rate is average about 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the achieved compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restric@@ ting the creation of tags to version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags may be deleted if necessary . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
set the rest as shown in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside this example :
number of simultaneously enco@@ ded wa@@ v files : with a dual core or quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine can be tried to en@@ code more than one wa@@ v file at the same time .
that &apos;s it , we have just completed the basic setup of &amp; co @-@ creator ; this configuration is used as a standard for each reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music , you never need to change it again .
in this section we describe the process of reading the &amp; CD ; we will create and set up MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard disk , has been described in the previous section . first , a connection to the Internet is set up , because we are comfortable and the CD ; the process described in this section must be repeated for each extrac@@ ting &amp; CD ; repeated .
since we use a CD , which is not yet contained in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look a little different than that for a &amp; CD ; with successful data obtained from fre@@ ed@@ b . therefore you will learn the &amp; CD ; instead of retri@@ eving data manually instead of retri@@ eving it from the internet . comments will point to the differences .
do not try to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this manual .
if this isn &apos;t done yet , the CD must now be inserted into the drive that has been defined in the main window .
after a short moment , the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as shown in the screen@@ shot . this only when the &amp; CD ; as an audio CD ; could be identified and read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this is not done , check the Help section in the section Ques@@ tions and Ans@@ wers , or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings .
attention : if the CD ; successfully fet@@ ched from the fre@@ ed@@ b , all titles of the pieces are already completed and the name of the artist and the album are displayed .
in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; key for your &amp; CD ; there , a window is displayed , and you can select the database entry that best suits your CD ; fits .
if you haven &apos;t selected the check box for the automatic query of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; -@@ Pre@@ ferences in the dialog for Settings ) , you can also manually trigger this by selecting the first button on the toolbar . if you don &apos;t have a local database , but get the data from the internet , you need the connection to the Internet .
e 1.2 step 02 : the CD editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first batch
enter the data for your CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Current title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist no longer has to be entered in the input field &apos; Current title &apos; unless you have a collection of different artists for each piece .
the bottom comment field can be used for the individual comments ini@@ di@@ vidu@@ al per piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments that are common for all pieces of the CD .
attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of data from the fre@@ ed@@ b , the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the following screen@@ shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor ( e.g. whether all words begin with capital letters or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments .
note : in this example , we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and on just 28 characters for the comment section . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least on what &amp; col@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; maximum allowed .
you can change the tag information of the generated files later any time using tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also re @-@ create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders and file formats . see the help page for more information .
in this example , this is not important as we don &apos;t provide the &amp; CD ; for more information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p for example can be found under Rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; , return to the main window . simply click on the row with the second piece .
the CD editor window appears again and you will see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data , which we recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current play . the title of the piece in any case and other information you desire .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all track data of the &amp; CD .
attention : this window does not appear when you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted in one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the toolbar . note that the artist and the album are displayed above the piece list .
note that there is a check mark before each line of a piece . only the titles that are selected are read out . simply click on the line to@@ gg@@ les the selection of the piece . make sure that all pieces are selected , or press the All items selected at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once .
by clicking on the selection button read the selection process , this window will appear to confirm . click OK and then we will have a look at the window with the orders and follow what runs out .
click on the Order tab to switch to the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly below the buttons of the toolbar .
this is the window to check the orders . the first piece is just read out onto the hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the lower left part of the window in the status bar .
you see this error message if you are trying to work with a code you haven &apos;t installed yet . pieces that were not successfully enco@@ ded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we have entered here in the example . have you checked whether you have write access to the temporary files and the destination folder ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the encoding of part 1 into the format MP3 . thus , read out and code in parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has not found any configuration option to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that appears configurable is the number of parallel processes for reading and encoding . the calcul@@ ator with an AM@@ D@@ 64 does not seem to have a problem with simultaneous reading and encoding ( of however two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read out while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third order is written in the queue of the encoder . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window with a message for a short time appears in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to generate compressed audio files like mp3 or O@@ GG , you need the enco@@ ders of your choice .
if you are familiar with CVS , you can download an anonymous copy from there . however , most distri@@ butions already contain a pre @-@ compiled package , as &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package . if you are reading this , you probably already have done it already ...
this section is aimed at people compiled from source files , and not intended for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help like the program can be adjusted to your needs once it is running , then the following is right for you :
a program that calls many different programs has many different settings . it is best to read the step by step , for example , to get to know the options and settings . it shows screen@@ shots of the different flash@@ cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example .
Hello , still reading ? even if only the help menu was cli@@ cked on after the first @-@ time launching of the program , without any clu@@ e as it should continue from this somewhat empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ?
what is it about ? anyone reading this has probably already started the program . it should look something like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no email . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual on &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; for whoever wants to add something useful or change it may do it . at least after contacting the author . and if you read this , he has left this section and is therefore agre@@ eing with this suggestion .
curi@@ ously , if you have managed to get the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these informations , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ aoke player from &amp; k@@ de ; besides others , he has also some features with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke editing of lyrics , the other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all OS@@ es with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; support also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ ound project driver , which is needed for G@@ US maps . AL@@ SA is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer .
&amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with varying colors , so that it is easy to follow the piece .
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag and drop so that you can drag and drop each MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ windows to k@@ mid .
supports the two existing standards to save text into MIDI files ( rec@@ itals or text occur@@ ren@@ ces ) . k@@ mid automatically determines the used procedure .
session support . when you quit &amp; k@@ de ; when playing a song , k@@ mid will start with the same song next time .
supports external MIDI synthes@@ iz@@ ers , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US maps ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can choose Open ... from the File menu . it will pop up the usual file dialogue with which help you can select the desired song .
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Windows into the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . this also works with several songs at the same time .
to play a piece of music , open it and press the Play button in the toolbar , select the item from the menu item or press the spac@@ eb@@ ar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece starts automatically as soon as you draw it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . ( with several pieces they are added to a collection and then played after each other . )
if you play a piece , you can jump to any position by using the middle mouse button and navig@@ ating with the slider back and forth .
if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows left and right of the tempo display and thus change the speed limit . to get back the original tempo , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar acts like a pressure on the pause pause or selecting the menu item pause in the menu item , thus interrup@@ ts playback . pressing the spac@@ eb@@ ar while no play is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback .
lyrics can be stored in two ways in one piece of music . some pieces use text event , others use lyrics and others both . some pieces have no text at all : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid , you can set which events are to be displayed and even better : the type of event is automatically determined using a song , so that you don &apos;t have to manually set anything manually . however , if you want to enable automatic text selection in the Settings menu , the Kar@@ aoke Text will automatically be selected . however , you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way .
if you want to set a type of event , select the entries of text events and / or property events from the Settings menu . the same function also has the keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you summari@@ ze . these are played back in series . in this section you will find how to use collections efficiently .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you can find it in the menu item under the item Organ@@ ize .... click New and enter the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on Copy and then specifying the name for the new collection .
if you have more than one collection , you can set the one you want in the collection manager .
the temporary collection contains all the songs you don &apos;t want to add to any other collection .
when leaving the application , this collection is not stored . remember that when you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection it must be selected in the collection manager . there , you can add a song with the Add button . in turn , the file dialog appears , with which you can select the desired song .
a second method to add a song depends on setting Automatic Add to Collection .
when automatic addition to the collection is enabled , a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening ( using File Open or Drag &amp; Drop ) .
when Automati@@ cally Add to the Collection is not enabled , when opening a piece , the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied .
to remove a song from a collection , you must open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Rem@@ ove .
you can select the order in which the songs will be played . if you select the series from the collection sequence of the main menu , the songs will be played in the order they have been added to the collection .
if you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the drop @-@ down list above the kar@@ aoke text .
to skip a song , select the Next song button , select next song from the menu item or press the arrow on the right .
to jump back to a song , select the previous piece button , the previous piece from the menu item or press the arrow to the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to be deleted and click the Del@@ ete button .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted , but it does not matter , as it is not saved when leaving &amp; k@@ mid .
this is absolutely necessary for synthes@@ iz@@ ers , which are not general MIDI capable . in this case , the MIDI map transl@@ ates General @-@ MIDI events into events that the synthes@@ izer understands .
for example , you can create a MIDI map that converts all the events of the change patch to B@@ right piano in the events of the Change Her@@ patch to Tru@@ mp@@ et type and thus always lets a trumpet sound when playing a piano originally .
if you have only one sound card , you do not need a MIDI map because all sound cards are GM -@@ compatible ( incl . A@@ we - and G@@ US @-@ cards , FM equipment and so on ) .
there are no programs to create MIDI maps , so you need to edit the corresponding file manually ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI map is a text file that stores all required implem@@ ent@@ ations for playing a piece .
each section may only appear once , except the key@@ map section , which may appear as often as desired . however , a prerequisite for this is that each occurrence has a different text id ( see below ) .
Def@@ ine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; Name of key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; An additional key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map ... EN@@ D OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS ... EN@@ D
you can see that Def@@ ine is used to indicate that a section begins ( except for OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as email so I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can provide for devices that are not General MIDI compatible .
in this section you will see how the patches of General MIDI are m@@ apped to your specific keyboard . general use looks like this :
please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM @-@ patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and also leave no row for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is needed to set all sounds that this instrument needs to play on the sound with the number M . if your keyboard does not support a firing signal ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can use a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which sounds similar to a gun . to do this , enter the following into the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section :
so if you want to play a MIDI file with a patch 127 ( gun shot ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , no matter which sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that here the term drum patch is meant to represent another percussion instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ al , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one with which the sound means the pitch of the always same drum ( as some key@@ boards have it ) .
the key@@ map section is used to indicate how sounds are m@@ apped on a particular channel or instrument . the use is :
as with the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the order of the lines is very important , as well as their presence . so you have to create 128 entries .
you can define multiple keywords for each channel and each instrument . you only have to use different names in the first line .
keywords are mainly used to map sounds to the perc@@ ussions @-@ channel . take a look at the provided key@@ maps as an example .
this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to swa@@ p the first and second channel , simply do it in the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section .
however , these settings are more useful for key@@ boards that have the percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following sample :
n is the channel that is m@@ apped to the channel N . if you use the key@@ map option , the key@@ map will be used with the name name for that channel . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored , which attempt to change the patch on that channel . in this case the patch is always used .
the For@@ ce@@ Patch can be useful , for example , to always use the perc@@ ussions @-@ patch on the perc@@ ussions @-@ channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der R@@ atio indicates in which Pit@@ ch Ben@@ der events are multiplied . if a MIDI file sends a pitch Ben@@ der event with the value n , this will be converted to the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then re@@ directed . the value 40@@ 96 is used to avoid a decim@@ al point in the map file .
this setting is needed because GM holds that a keyboard that is supposed to play a pitch Ben@@ der event with the value 40@@ 96 to play a ton higher . unfortunately , however , some key@@ boards try to play two sounds up to one oc@@ tave . to find the right value on your keyboard , you have to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid .
to use a MIDI map , simply open the MIDI Settings dialog . you can find this in the menu under Settings , Point MIDI Settings
the channel view is a window with a whole series of key@@ boards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards you see which sounds are played straight .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel there is a drop @-@ down list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the knob does not light green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the channel view has ( until now ) two different views to display the played sounds . view the View menu in the Settings menu under the channel view : settings
the pace LCD displays the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the bigger the speed .
you can change the tempo of a song . so if you find a song too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows left and right of the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music . it contains notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc ; this allows the same MIDI file to perform very different results on two different devices , just as two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way .
good , I can &apos;t force anybody , &amp; k@@ mid ; to use . but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good synthes@@ izer you can also change the individual instruments , the speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything .
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) from &amp; k@@ mid ; this happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support has been compiled . to solve the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos; s home page )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I have no desire to add all files individually .
agree , therefore support &amp; k@@ mid ; Drag &amp; Drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window .
first , activate the Automati@@ cally Add setting to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can press the arrow key to the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down playback . to restore the standard speed , you can double @-@ click the LCD .
I have a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I play a MIDI file ) or attached ( when I play a kar@@ aoke file ) . in this way , I have to switch to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; change the window and drag the file into the &amp; k@@ mid window .
if you just want to listen to a file quickly without adding them to a collection , switch Automati@@ cally Add to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection . opening files
suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ M@@ ID , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mi@@ d. first you just want to play the first file . so you set the automatic addition to the collection and open A.@@ mi@@ d. your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file .
then decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
these people sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you very much ! if I listen to these songs or see the postcard , it anim@@ ates me , further to &amp; k@@ mid ; to program .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; Malaga ( Spain ) . at the moment I &apos;m studying mathematics at the university of Ma@@ acute ; Malaga . at the moment I &apos;m studying mathematics , collecting MIDI files , doing music and pro@@ positions .
if you want to know where to download MIDI / Kar@@ aoke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you want to make me happy , write me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es
if you send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I will be among friends of &amp; k@@ mid ; count ( if you want to ) . before sending a MIDI file , you should contact me , since I might already have the file .
I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and by no one gets money for it . I want to emphasize that I only use it further because / when I receive feedback from users ( post@@ cards or emails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - correction of the defect that the pitch of the AW@@ E @-@ cards was too high .
my thanks also goes to Jose L@@ us San@@ che@@ z for testing the G@@ us support , Ign@@ acio Gar@@ cia for testing the AW@@ E support , H@@ as Pet@@ ter Bi@@ eker , O@@ la Sig@@ ur@@ d@@ son , Marc Di@@ ef@@ en@@ bruch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , error correction or even a suppor@@ tive e @-@ mail .
and of course my thanks also goes to all these excellent musicians on the web , who give us these wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ aoke files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ mid can be found on his homepage , which is located under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mi@@ d.@@ html . on the homepage you can trace the development , search information and see pictures . you will also find links to pages with other kar@@ aoke songs , &amp; etc ;
a sound card . I recommend a good sound card or an external synthes@@ izer , because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound@@ card . it &apos;s not the same whether you are using an FM radio or an AW@@ E card .
if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you will need to compile and compile with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you have a sound card , except that you can &apos;t listen to music .
if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mailing lists or send an error message directly to me .
&amp; S@@ MB ; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , Phon@@ o and ff@@ m@@ peg . the program is used for playing video files supported by M@@ Player or Phon@@ on supported formats , as well as for playing DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet finished as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this computer .
for additional help please check the page The K@@ DE website for new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User mailing list .
the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ ock@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is the window with the playlist .
it is possible to save the preferred links under the book@@ marks menu , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category stored playlist .
of course , you can add groups to groups to receive an additional hierarchy level . if you click an entry , its group and all its sub @-@ groups will be copied to the current category and playback begins with the attached entry .
the categories &apos; current play , television and permanent playlist can also be changed by editing the XML configuration files . of course , you can only do this if &amp; KM@@ Player ; not running . the different files in the directory ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / , can be selected from the View menu and as next editing mode . by clicking a sub @-@ group , only the XML content of this section is displayed .
after changing XML files , you have to select a playlist from the Edit menu and select either the Edit Mode , or select another category .
all changes are lost when the editing mode is left or another group is selected without matching the playlist .
due to the ease of the author of &amp; KM@@ Player ; some functions can be turned on only by modi@@ fying the XML configuration files ..
the animation at startup and end can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c and modi@@ fying &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 of the option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be inserted easily .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; KM@@ Player ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml ; the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation during startup does not need to be short , it is automatically terminated by opening another source . this would be annoying in the end animation , so the user can quit the application a second time .
a simple example of a start animation can be displaying a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; body@@ guard ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ guard ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; In the source package of &amp; KM@@ Player ; are in the list testing / some examples of S@@ MI@@ L the von &amp; KM@@ Player ; supported .
there is a tab for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the configuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Player ; here you can set the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for de@@ bug@@ ging is the button &apos; console &apos; in the toolbar of KM@@ Player . here is the output of m@@ player .
there is no tab for this playback device in the configuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Player ; everything has to be configured by editing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c , like setting up the back@@ end via mim@@ et@@ ype . here &apos;s an example like a &apos; flash &apos; with the sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played inside and S@@ MB ; it can even embed the special embed video embed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
so that the &amp; KM@@ Player ; &apos; flash &apos; can play in HTML pages , the &amp; KM@@ Player ; module as service provider for the mim@@ e type application / x @-@ shock@@ wave flash in the Setup dialog file assignment of K@@ DE is specified .
the Kon@@ quer@@ or or S@@ MB ; is used in a console application and search for error messages regarding loading the browser module library . if there are no errors , the back@@ end output is within the S@@ MB ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) .
to always take a given back@@ end for a certain mim@@ e type ( of course only if this has been determined ) , it needs to be done by manually changing the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c file . for example , Phon@@ on should re@@ play all og@@ g files :
&amp; S@@ MB ; can play cards from TV , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( requires k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be watched , the device must be used and the TV channels need to be configured . to do this , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog , or the configuration file can be edited manually .
to configure V@@ DR ( Video Data Recorder ) settings in the KM@@ Player , the dialog in the settings is to be used in - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video port . there should be detected ports from which one is selected . the encoding must be found ( for example , it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a DV@@ B in it .
since the V@@ DR support for S@@ MB can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this sort of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . for this reason , the vide@@ o@@ for@@ lin@@ ux distribution for the X server must be supported . therefore , the X@@ Free@@ 86 server must be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) :
internally , S@@ MB uses different names for the sources . at the time of creation of this documentation , these are dv@@ d@@ nav@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , intro@@ source , pi@@ p@@ es@@ ource , t@@ v@@ scanner , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source .
are there hints as to make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter when I play from it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom can be run as a user root after plug@@ ging the device . it is absolutely certain that / dev / c@@ drom can be seen on the CD@@ ROM drive .
x@@ ine only starts up slowly , why does my CPU need to be tested for performance every time ?

Q@@ t ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is needed to compile &amp; play .
L@@ ate@@ x ; : a professional writing application . among Unix @-@ like systems is likely to rely on the package &amp; tex@@ live ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux distribution . for the installation , the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD should be used .
the &amp; Ki@@ le ; -@@ Project contains some pre @-@ compiled packages from &amp; Ki@@ le ; for various distri@@ butions . they enable easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the box ; website .
this manual is for everyone - regardless of experience with latex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; Ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users probably don &apos;t have to read this manual . however , all the suggestions for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is requested , contact via the box should be made .
if you have any questions about comp@@ iling &amp; ki@@ cking , or if extensions are requested this should be addressed to the mailing list Ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; latex ; environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Desktop . &amp; Ki@@ le ; provides the possibility to use all and latex ; functions in a graphical interface and within this a simple , immediate and customized access to all &amp; latex ; programs . finally , the easy @-@ to @-@ use assistant , the &amp; latex ; -@@ reference and the powerful project management .
to learn more about &amp; k@@ ate ; and to learn its possibilities the manual should be consul@@ ted to K@@ ate . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start working there directly with the reading of the chapter with the editor of &amp; k@@ ate ; start .
for latex ; is the correct expression : lay @-@ TECH . while the original and tex ; difficult to use , a lay@@ man ( lay lay ) &amp; latex ; -@@ mac@@ ros can also be used . a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it comes from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port .
if there is only one good view to latex ; given , it is not the ultimate book about it . to be able to master properly , good books should be used e.g. H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; latex ; : document Pre@@ par@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 d@@ af@@ Ã ¼ r .
as well as other mark@@ up languages includes latex ; an introduction with which the general properties like paper format , page number@@ ing and text gre@@ e are specified as well as a body with the text . the introduction contains at least the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ begin { document } .
the Quick @-@ Up Assistant from &amp; Ki@@ le is a useful feature for fast creation of a document in &amp; box ; the selection of the wizard ( menu ) offers a number of options for creating the document .
document classes : this describes the type of document to be created : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , letter &#91; report &#93; , article &#91; report &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , projector &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , slides &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user defined .
encoding : this is set to set the encoding . it should use the encoding of the system . modern systems increasingly use UT@@ F @-@ 8 encoding as standard . at best UT@@ F @-@ 8@@ x should be used ( for correct processing of the latex ; -@@ documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used additional packages for latex ; they only need to be selected in the check box .
article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the documentation classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( for compliance with German DIN regulations ) .
new users don &apos;t have to worry about it . this is a short description of the functions and further information is given in the section .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides - as well as other source text editors - the high@@ lighting of used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the in@@ appropriate ) . by &amp; Ki@@ le ; it is very likely that some mathematical environment is not closed . however , it may be noticed by the modest appearance of the output file . however , it will save you time and hands through the emphasis .
automatic completion of environments will be created by adding a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) by &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically creates a blank line ( for entering the text ) and the associated line for the line of the command ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be set in the menu Set@@ ting ... La@@ Te@@ X commands disabled .
all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; latex ; allows the document to be divided into the following elements ( part is the highest and sub@@ paragraph the bottom element ) :
in the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by one click of the mouse .
when creating your own latex ; -@@ files , the search search can be very helpful . as soon as a DVI ; file is created , &amp; Ki@@ le ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in DVI ; -@@ viewer to the corresponding line in the &amp; latex ; source code .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as font and is next to PDF the common output of &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; there are many tools for viewing , converting and printing DVI ; files for various systems and devices .
when using the search search , the elements of the DVI ; file are cli@@ pped to the editor and as soon as an element in the DVI ; file is cli@@ cked , the corresponding section in the &amp; latex ; source text is jump to the corresponding place in the DVI ; viewer .
master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master document , work with other .@@ tex files is simplified . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set to project settings .
quick build : the &amp; latex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( unless there are no errors in source code ) .
monitoring : in this mode , the DVI ; file will be viewed on the top of the pane , and there is no call to &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after fast construction .
when viewing the Edit tool bar , the three large selection fields should be noticed . the selection fields have been developed for quick assembly of common elements into the document . the first drop @-@ down is for quick breakdown of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... The available and latex ; -@@ statements for the sub@@ division are :
the Other is for inser@@ ting items such as keywords , notes or references . the available possibilities are :
name : this command creates a description for a section , an image or another element .
reference : used for reference to a specified term ( selection of a selection box ) .
when using quote , a selection list with literary entries is displayed . for &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; this works only if the file belongs to a project . for editing &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files are appropriate editors necessary . the author has good experience with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can also be written in &amp; Ki@@ le ; by hand .
the last drop @-@ down box with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ nig is used for setting the font . it can be used to specify the font names for the main text , the joints , etc . the following symbols are available for distribution :
when calling &amp; Ki@@ le , two choices are available : 1 . the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and determining the settings . 2 . the document can be written by hand .
the clas@@ ps after the command \ \ Documents class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; specifies the font size . if the font is not set at the beginning , this can also be done in the text .
once the source code above has been entered , the &amp; latex ; source code has to be compiled . the simplest way to do this is the use of the volume building or the Schnell@@ bau button .
the source code must be saved before comp@@ iling . &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically exec@@ utes the storage .
if the comp@@ iling of the document is out of place , it should be searched for errors in the logging function . when using fast construction , the ey@@ epi@@ ece should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the logging should also be taken into account .
a environment ( environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with a font size 12 is created , and only a few columns should have a different font . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } is to popul@@ ate the environment .
changes are fixed only within the environment ( from \ \ start { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no restrictions ( number ) for changes within an environment .
there are many possibilities to increase the read@@ ability and usability of the document . it can be added , for example , certain fonts , grease pressure , passive pressure , sub@@ missions , etc . these commands will either end with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for passive printing and is long until it is closed with a \ \ end { or } or another environment . a single word in a phrase can be represented cur@@ sively with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ quote : creates a quote in the document . the quote begins with \ \ start { ratio } and ends with \ \ end { ratio } .
after the background for writing the source text with the &amp; latex ; mark@@ up language is presented , follow a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; box ; .
as soon as a bit of text is entered in the wizard , a few adjustments for the better read@@ ability of the document should be made . therefore , a quote , a few passages in fat and ital@@ ics pressure and a poem are to be used to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been viewed , Editor View or C@@ trl E can be turned back to the editor ( for internal viewer ) . an external viewer must close its window .
once the DVI ; file is created , the document can be printed or converted to a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try and have fun .
DVI ; is a continuous file format ( D e V ice I n@@ ase ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; for read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .d@@ v@@ vi output such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF -@@ converter or computer screens .
for printing a &amp; DVI ; file the same steps are necessary as for the creation of a document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - the document can then be printed ( if the printer is set correctly ) by file printing ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the toolbar allows converting the DVI ; file to other formats . once the DVI ; file is created from the &amp; latex ; source code , the conversion into other formats can begin using the buttons in the toolbar .
the preference search allows the direct jump from the editor to the associated position within the DVI ; file .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a corresponding setting for all ® latex ; bin@@ dings . to do this , just setup Modern under Settings ...
in order to search for the desired search , the mouse poin@@ ter must be positioned in a line of the source code and then be cli@@ cked on the preference search . the jump to the corresponding place in the DVI ; viewer is then taken .
with this function in &amp; Ok@@ epi@@ ece ; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ document the corresponding &amp; latex ; -@@ document by &amp; Ki@@ le ; opened and jump to the corresponding line . for this , &amp; Table ; in &amp; Ok@@ epi@@ ece ; set as text editor ( setting ey@@ epi@@ ece ... Editor )
if the use of express construction of the &amp; DVI file does not open , an error may occur . if there is an error , this is displayed in the logging file or in the message window in summary .
the logging file declares the source code in the source code . in the editor , the pop @-@ up error and N@@ Ã ¤ th@@ est La@@ Te@@ X errors may be used for errors between the errors . the log file always specifies the line in which the error appears . in order to view the error message , the error must be cli@@ cked into the logging and &amp; Ki@@ le ; jumps to the faulty line .
once cli@@ cked on the corresponding button in the toolbar , a window will appear to select the template you want to use for the document . the default options are :
when selecting an empty document , a document can be written either from scratch or the wizard will be used to quickly create a new document . for more information , see the section .
common users of &amp; latex ; mostly use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be in &amp; Ki@@ le ; created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / latex ; file needs to be opened or created a new file . &amp; Ki@@ le ; can create a new template using existing document and selecting file template from document ...
when creating a new document from a file New , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set in Settings ... Settings General .
when creating your own template it is therefore necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS $ $ : this string is replaced by typing in the document class . typically , it is used as following : \ \ Documents class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS $ $ &#93; { article } .
the simplest way to create a template is the use of the assistant and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document was created in this way , the following steps have to be completed :
when creating a new document , you can choose your own template instead of the default .
a template can be created from any kind of latex ; a simple way to create a template should be sought after one on the Internet and the steps described below .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; used &amp; k@@ ate ; as internal editor . &amp; k@@ ate ; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and high@@ lighting many different types of text files ( including also &amp; latex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) .
to know more about &amp; k@@ ate ; and to experience its possibilities the manual should be consul@@ ted to K@@ ate . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can begin there directly with reading the chapter work with the editor of &amp; k@@ ate ; start .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides very practical and latex ; command reference , which can be called using the La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains a detailed description of almost all commands that can be found in &amp; latex ; use as well as their syntax .
double click with a pressed C@@ trl key to select the &amp; tex ; this means that in this way you only use \ \ &apos; par \ \ \ &apos; par \ \ \ &apos; par \ \ &apos; par \ \ &apos; par \ \ &apos; par \ \ &apos; par \ \ &apos; .
when drag@@ ging the text with a left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the clip@@ board .
when using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key , parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; has the possibility to browse and highlight various types of source texts . for example , the latex ; -@@ commands from the normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by a different color .
many assistants can include additional jumping marks . this is a separate type of book@@ marks within the text . the Men@@ Ã ¤ ge Edit Ank@@ le St@@ amps or the corresponding key element enable the jump to the next or last jump mark . this is also highlighted with this jump mark , so that it is automatically fo@@ ol@@ ed at the first input of a character .
editing is probably one of the main aspects of using a program such as &amp; Ki@@ le ; although &amp; k@@ ates ; already excellent possibilities has been added in &amp; Ki@@ le ; important functions for writing a &amp; latex ; source text has been added ; special instructions for their selection . under Edit Sel@@ ection , the following commands are included in the text selection :
choose a complete paragraph ( group of lines containing a blank line on both sides ) . with a paragraph , not a text is meant with continuous lines ( as in other text editors ) . this expanded meaning includes tables , and latex ; commands and all other lines of the source code .
select the word under the current cursor position . this selection also has an extended meaning as this command also includes &amp; latex ; -@@ commands with a swe@@ ep line ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
to delete a part of the document , it can be removed first and removed by pressing the Del@@ ete key . &amp; k@@ ate ; provides the key C@@ trl ; K with which the entire line is removed .
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; box ; is included in the description to Edi@@ ting Select paragraph .
it has already been made clear that environments play a central role in latex ; therefore , &amp; Ki@@ le ; for further instructions under machining environment for a possible easy work with latex ; .
this command will jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
this command will jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the command to locate the environment .
if the cursor is located before or within the command \ \ begin { environment } , jump to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted ambient commands a quick overview of the surrounding environment can be lost . this command termin@@ ates the recently opened environment , so that the ne@@ sted environment structure is not destroyed .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; also provides special commands for the &amp; latex ; groups specified by braces { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are a few important commands that correspond to those from editing environment .
this command will jump to the start of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed right in front of the opening bracket .
this command will jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the cur@@ ly clasp .
if the cursor is in front of or behind the cur@@ ly bracket of a &amp; tex ; group # will jump to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted groups braces can quickly be lost over . this command termin@@ ates the last opened group , so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; -@@ groups is not destroyed .
in &amp; latex ; two simple instructions are used as a slide . for the pur@@ pos@@ eful implementation is used in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the sign &quot; is used for two simple quotes . also for the end of the application the sign &quot; is used . &amp; Ki@@ le ; knows this case and has two complete signs for and@@ latex ; one .
this automatic entry of the double quotation marks can be set under Settings box ... La@@ Te@@ X can be switched on and off .
you can also use specific settings ( e.g. n@@ German or french ) and thus German or French characters . there are also many other languages available .
when pressing Shift ; enter key &amp; box ; an intelligent line break . if the current position is located within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; Ki@@ le ; not only a line break but at the same time the command \ \ item .
inside a sp@@ read@@ sheet environment , add the current line to \ \ \ \ with a ending line break .
even better - &amp; Ki@@ le ; is intelligent enough to support pre @-@ set &amp; latex ; - or user @-@ defined environments . these can be set under Settings ... Create La@@ Te@@ X .
some users want to arrange the columns in sp@@ read@@ sheets and all E@@ t characters ( stamp ; ) ; try to achieve this . when pressing Shift ; Alt ; seek &amp; Ki@@ le ; following the next tab@@ ul@@ ator in the above line . although this tab is not the associated tab@@ ul@@ ator , add to the column position of the current tab .
although &amp; k@@ ates ; already a good source code completion offers , it has been added to &amp; Ki@@ le ; for special commands ( mostly for latex ; ) , there are three different modes installed . all these modes can be set up for different modes of operation under Settings ...
when starting a new environment using the command \ \ begin { environment } , &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically add the command \ \ end { environment } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
when pressing the click key , the last letter of the input will be removed and then the complete list can be gr@@ asp@@ ed . on the other hand , the list can also be sc@@ aled by entering another letter .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . the descriptions are obviously removed by selecting a command . alternatively , jumping nets can be added , so that an easy jump to these positions is possible and the desired parameters can then be inserted .
under Settings Ki@@ le ; Set up ... Ki@@ le ; Compl@@ ements can be made to these lists . it can be selected different devices for &amp; ver@@ tex ; - and latex ; -@@ commands as well as W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ b@@ Ã ¼ cher of the general language use .
the command mode is not useful for the completion of environments . there are always a few letters entered with \ \ begin . on the other hand , the environment is used so often that &amp; Ki@@ le ; a special mode for performing environments .
when calling the space above Edit fully @-@ dep@@ rec@@ ated environment or the key Alt + Shift key , the command to open the environment is automatically frozen and it appears \ \ begin . then the ambient inter@@ ruption can be continued in the simplest way and by pressing the input button .
once this is completed , the environment will be closed automatically once again . as soon as the box detects that it is a list environment , a first \ \ item command is even added .
under Settings box ; set up ... box ; full settings can be made to these lists . this mode uses the list of completion @-@ mode for &amp; tex ; - and latex ; -@@ commands .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; support custom lists of rel@@ ent@@ ations that are immediately replaced by lower strings . the lists can be set up under Settings ... The ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l file , for example , contains the L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X entry .
for example , the letter L is entered and the word inter@@ ruption mode is introduced over the menu Edit or the key C@@ trl + Alt space bar , the letter L is replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
large openings are not helpful for automatic translation . however , it has been found that many things are written more than once in a document . thus , it offers &amp; Ki@@ le ; the agreement for all already written des@@ kt@@ ops .
this mode can be set up in the Settings box ... F@@ ills are completely isolated . here , the threshold value for displaying the completion can also be specified .
the exec@@ utable files can be installed in the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Ki@@ le / complete / mode / / / / / / / / / / complete / mode / complete home folder . mode stands for Ab@@ brevi@@ ation ( abbrevi@@ ation ) , dictionary ( text book ) or tex .
the Prin@@ ted Graphics dialog forms the introduction of graphics as simple as possible . to view the basics on the graphics formats , the sections should be ignored .
PS files are not as known as PDF files but offer an excellent basis for changes and new arrangements of pages . if the PDF output is used , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; -@@ tools , and then converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf into a PDF file .
to view the results of the work , the source code needs to be compiled . all building tools are grouped in groups in the creation , compilation , conversion and create view .
for comp@@ iling the source code for viewer like &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the further conversion can be used the key Alt ; 2 . after that , the DVI ; file can be viewed in the standard viewer by Alt ; 3 using Alt ; 4 ; 4 the DVI ; file is converted to a PS file and viewed by Alt ; 5 the PS file .
when using the express construction command , usually a viewer is called after the comp@@ iler . if no embedded viewer is used , a new window will open each time .
a new project about the project New Project .... Hier@@ bei will ask the following information for the project :
when exec@@ uting the file name window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file .
the Script function from &amp; Ki@@ le ; allows the exec@@ uting of EC@@ MA@@ Script code . the scripts can be managed using scripts in the vertical bar .
the API scripts are not yet fully developed and can be added to other versions of &amp; Ki@@ le .
first , it must be said that the execution environment of scripts is in &amp; box ; a system @-@ wide object ( = box ) has the following methods :
latex ; is a quite developed system in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a lot of different aids to support the user .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ live ; are shipped with many documents . included is a documentation for the included packages and a further latex ; -@@ reference .
a full @-@ depth Ref@@ ern@@ z for Fron@@ tex ; and its &quot; Young Friends &quot; . it is not just a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) but rather is a complete user manual for the &amp; latex ; commands and is therefore ideal for searching for a certain format@@ ting . as this is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; Ki@@ le ; into three important book@@ marks .
because of the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; delivered , finding the right document is not always easy . as possible help offers &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k , which contains a database with all to &amp; box ; delivered documents and herein for a graphical surface area .
all documents are divided into categories and the biggest advantage is the search for package names or keywords . from &amp; Ki@@ le ; then only the results are displayed .
double @-@ clicking with the mouse or using the space bar opens the viewer for the document .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener and user @-@ friendly &amp; latex ; - / tex ; source code editor which can be executed on all systems with installed &amp; k@@ de ; and Unix systems ; is also a part of the Fink project , which makes &amp; Ki@@ le ; also on &amp; Mac ; with installed OS @-@ X can be executed .
many thanks to those who asp@@ ire after the Fort@@ ress of the &amp; Ki@@ le ; project and prepare for many hours for the development of tools we all use under consideration of the &amp; GNU ; license .

&amp; k@@ sig ; is a graphical editor to manage many different sig@@ natures for e @-@ mails . using the command @-@ line interface you can create random sig@@ natures or sig@@ natures from a list . this command @-@ line interface provides sig@@ natures for external mail programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; .
for random sig@@ natures , any signature will be read from the sig@@ natures file from &amp; k@@ sig ; by many sig@@ natures with different quotes , styles and information , you can make your emails varied and unique .
for day sig@@ natures the same signature is made from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig for the whole day . for each day use different sig@@ natures , as with the random sig@@ natures you create unique emails .
to create a new signature , select C@@ trl ; N file New . this will preserve you ; empty signature ; in the signature section , click on the &amp; lt ; empty signature ; and paste it with C@@ trl ; S file Save or click on the Save icon .

the version 3.2 of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; all these tools use com@@ man@@ ders as surface and lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as base . the combination yields fast , efficient , complete and productive tools .
everyone who has worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation knows me and how outstanding it is . let &apos;s raise it a bit , we give it a graphical interface ! no longer need to rely on a terminal ; simply click the icon for the XML processor and finished !
this application expects a index@@ .@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if index@@ .@@ doc@@ book is located in the ge@@ uner@@ able working folder , then let the current work folder be checked . if not , remove the selection of current working folders and specify the folder you want in the field of other folders .
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; files are deleted every time mein@@ pro@@ c is started .
as I said before , everyone who has worked at the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there is now a great graphical interface for this .
if the newly opened file index@@ .@@ doc@@ book is , simply select the current working folder . if not , select the current working folder and enter the folder where the index@@ .@@ doc@@ book is to be found .
when it comes to an output on the screen its file is faulty . please check the reported errors and try again .
if the file to be checked is already marked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , then let the current file simply be attached . if not , they delete the check in the current file and select the file to be checked by other file - file selection .
if you want to know if the file is well @-@ formed , click the well @-@ formed checking selection .
for use of a &amp; DT@@ D ; specified in the &amp; XML ; file , select &amp; DT@@ D ; ( Internal ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) and specify the location of the definition UR@@ I ; for the DEL@@ D ; schema as well as for the Relax@@ NG verification is required in the file selection .
yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , has also a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library .

enter the name of the file as the result should have named . the file is normally stored in your home folder .
the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , loaded , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , even possibly little to do . this makes the plug @-@ in system very powerful . you can benefit from the additional functionality immediately and do not have to wait until someone builds the desired in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . you can find the plug @-@ ins in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements .
to install a plug @-@ in or a node , we start the Edit menu from the menu . this will open the following dialog :
this dialog allows to manage all the included plug @-@ ins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; -@@ element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug @-@ ins without a location &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , this path to search the plug @-@ in .
often on one project several people work in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the user &apos;s nick@@ name and serves for unique identification .
one member can have several roles in the project , such as both team leaders and sub @-@ project leaders .
the user can choose from the list of team members who he is . this happens by looking for the team member from the list and the button S@@ etze as pressed . the currently selected member ( their identi@@ fier ) appears bold after you are : text .
nick@@ names and the setting of their own identity are important with regard to news and ann@@ ot@@ ations . see for further information notes .
apart from an overview of their team , there is another advantage by capturing the members of the team : it can be an event for information to the team leaders when something specific happens . see for further information .
event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project . an example would be recording the opening and closing of the project , so that later it can be seen how much someone worked on it , or sending a message when a file is backed up , or a script that enters a file into CVS , as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ;
on the Event configuration page of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted .
an email will be sent to the add@@ res@@ see list selected in the recipient list . the add@@ res@@ see can be a team or sub@@ project manager . see where such conductors are set up .
comments are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
ann@@ ot@@ ation is simple . either the comment item can be selected from the Editor context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword can be entered in a comment area followed by comment text .
comments can be sent to a designated member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , where nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the team member , will play a role in the project from the following possibilities : team leader Area manager Sub@@ project manager Accor@@ ding to the area and sub@@ project leaders , the corresponding area or sub@@ project names should be given as in the following examples below .
nick@@ names and roll names are case @-@ sensitive , but spaces around the braces and the : make the note invalid .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and format@@ ting languages that is DT@@ D agnos@@ tic and supports web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages .
the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here , only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found in .
the settings can be set up by Set@@ anta ... This dialog covers some pages that are treated after each other .
the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; regarding tags including car complete can be changed with it . the entries are :
large / lo@@ wer@@ case of tags : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically inserted tags . normal large / lo@@ wer@@ case means the tags are inserted as they are described in the tag XML files .
large / lo@@ wer@@ case of attributes : large / lower case of automatically inserted attributes . normal upper / lo@@ wer@@ case means the attributes are inserted in the way they are described in the tag XML files .
optional tags automatically close : if checked , tags for which the closing tag is optional , this immediately after &amp; gt ; inserted .
do not automatically close optional tags : as above for all other tags except for easy tags .
automatically update start and end tag : if enabled , the corresponding end tag is included and vice versa .
automatic Re@@ placement of Acc@@ ent Charac@@ ters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ ented characters into the appropriate encoding during typing .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for the detection of different types of files .
default character encoding : the encoding of newly created or otherwise opened files ( where the encoding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) . however , this setting here is removed from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D has not been detected . however , this setting here is removed from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
create a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; creates backup copies on a regular basis , so that in case of a power failure or crash the document can be restored from this backup at the next start of the program . this is not the same as saving the file .
the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editor area or in your own view ( or the documentation in a box ) , making it possible to preview the documentation , preview and source code at the same time .
reset the window settings to the default when starting the next start is useful when the user interface is confused by modi@@ fying the M@@ DI modes and do@@ cking / hanging views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameters .
the warning message area is used to control the display of warnings by bar@@ bs from non @-@ poll@@ s .
the place to change behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can be set the display of symbols instead of scripts , as well as the synchron@@ izing behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source code view in shared mode .
here the par@@ ser and the structure tree , which represent the representation of the par@@ ser nodes in the document , can be set in details .
in the mouse click on the structure tree the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons .
in the Struc@@ tural Adjust@@ ment area , the visibility of nodes in the tree , the updating frequency of the tree when editing and how deep in a change in the structure tree is to be opened automatically . empty nodes are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are those in which no element has been found in the current document .
the range for setting short@@ cuts ( a kind of templates ) , which can be un@@ folded when editing a larger text . abbrevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s . this means there can be a valid group for PHP , in which the if@@ EL short@@ cut is something else than in a group valid for Javascript .
here the plug@@ ins are managed . plug @-@ ins are K@@ part applications from third party , which can be re@@ used by each node @-@ capable application , the most known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified :
address : the path to the plugin if it is not in a standard as $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
input : this information is passed to the plug @-@ in at startup , so it can open the current file , the associated folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
load the component in &quot; Read @-@ only &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in refuses to load the load . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts usually refuse loading when this option is not selected .
check the plugin : if this is activated , then test &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if the entered information is correct . choose to save the entry even if the plug @-@ in is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , as of version 3.3 , troubleshooting was completely re@@ developed . support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Deb@@ ug@@ ger was set , as well as support for the DB@@ G Deb@@ ug@@ ger . instead , a Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin concept was implemented that allows various implem@@ ent@@ ations via plug@@ ins .
currently only one plugin is available , support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ isi@@ ap@@ lus ; inserts .
using the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger in the project settings . using the Options button next to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin sel@@ ector , the specific settings can be changed .
if a de@@ bu@@ gger is activated for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; interface :
a view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed . usually appears in the left dock .
a view in which all holding points , with line numbers and conditions are listed . usually appears in the bottom D@@ ock .
a view in which the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger . usually appears in the bottom D@@ ock .
depending on the supported features of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action , the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger , if required , or it tells the plugin to listen to Deb@@ ug@@ ger &apos;s requirements . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened that uses a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that it does not have to be respected in the normal case .
the counterpart to Deb@@ ug@@ ging Session Start the session . includes the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates listening to requirements .
sends an HTTP request to the server to initiate a de@@ bug request . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this request is displayed in the Deb@@ ug@@ ger output .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script and continuously send information about the monitored variables as well as the current executed line . if this happens while the script is stopped , execution will continue . if the script is started , the script will start with the request .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without having to send information to monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , execution will continue . if there is a de@@ bug request , execution starts when a request is made .
the de@@ bu@@ gger exec@@ utes the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include .
the de@@ bu@@ gger will execute the next instruction in the script , where it is possible to correctly clean in functions and include .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to skip the statement and go to the next one as if there was not the current one .
opens a dialog where a variable or print@@ out can be entered , which should be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view .
with this dialog a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable is set .
&amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a work of Keith Is@@ dale as well as this part of the documentation . &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; front @-@ end and a part of x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g you can find on ht@@ t@@ p : / / x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g@@ .@@ s@@ f@@ .net with many other works of Keith .
this chapter describes how to adapt &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus to your needs and as you &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , can help to get better .
document type editing packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; they allow &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus to provide capabilities like car complete and k@@ not trees . their simplicity and flexibility makes from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s exist in two types , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages and / CSS ; s &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two parts , the tag folder and the tool@@ bars . tag folder contains two file types , called &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and Tag@@ XML files with extension .@@ tag .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or created automatically from an existing DT@@ D . see for details about conversion .
this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are to be created , then the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool boxes . in short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and content of the property catalogue , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the tag shows . the file lists the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool@@ bars allow a quick insertion of tags in a document with no risk of a write error .
tag folder are nothing but folder . they contain only the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folder carry the name of the description language and version , so there . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML and declares whether they are necessary or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better view and more information when working with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way .
this is the root element of a tag XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but does not contain anything as a single element type .
the type of tag is a script function . when used , &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; An argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the class class . the name of the base class for this class . ( family 2 only )
only valid for the Type method . specifies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
if yes , the tag has a common attribute and attributes within that tag can be added any other day . ( only family 1 )
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is an element type element .
specifies an attribute of a tag . this item can only occur once for each attribute . it specifies the name and type of the attribute . additionally , it contains other tags describing how this attribute should be displayed &amp; etc ; This is a single item type element .
prints the source code used for filling in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used to achieve the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus is used to achieve the source of data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a interface name and method name . the arguments passed to the method can be empty or % tag name % , which means the name of the current tag .
a container Tag that summari@@ zes the elements of a list . it can only occur once for an attribute description . it is an element type element .
specifies the position of the attribute of a tag within a dialog . this tag can only occur once for each attribute in a dialog ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
specifies the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be present for each field in the dialog once ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; tag ) . this element is empty .
specifies a list of elements that may appear within the tag to be defined . this element is a single element type .
returns a list of elements that end a day . this element is a single element type .
all Tag@@ XML files need to start with an &amp; XML ; declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly ch@@ ained and closed .
spaces do not affect anything , but pay attention &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and lt ; text &gt; will be replaced .
to check the Tag@@ XML files , the Tools dialog is up in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; window to start and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . a further dialog will appear , whose simple instructions are to follow .
this function is currently not available . currently , the check only takes place when loading Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
below is an example of a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; -@@ schema . the filen@@ ame for this tag XML file is to be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
below is an example of a functioning family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load feature is described . the filen@@ ame of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; void &quot; &gt; &amp; lt ; att@@ r name = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is also fairly simple and there is an editor for it , accessible via DT@@ D editing DT@@ D settings . this can be edited di@@ ed@@ es@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; should be created a simple &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; Version = Use 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . ( - / / W@@ 3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nick@@ name .
an action can be set by setting actions ... click New action leads to the same dialog :
this action assigned keyboard short@@ cut . by clicking the Custom button , a keyboard short@@ cut can be assigned ; with K@@ 1 the current keyboard short@@ cut can be removed .
the simplest actions . a text can be entered in the detailed settings and when exec@@ uting the action , this text will be inserted in the document at the current cursor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that can change the document or use as input ( or parts of the document ) , are started . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even the Quick Start dialog or the various See in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ TE@@ Ps .
first , the name of the script and interpreter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in the command line as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . In this way , the script tries to find : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in its path : $ P@@ AT@@ H . there are other special variables that can be used in the command line :
% f : we are replaced with the current document URL . in case of a local document , file : / is removed from the document name .
% p@@ id : will be replaced with PID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if only one instance is running , the text is added to the PID number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used by the external script .
the parameters for this event , usually the filen@@ ame of the current document , or the path to the project file .
in addition to the methods listed above , a script can be input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , at the default input . in the input field , input can be determined what is to be sent to the default input . possibilities are :
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is normally only useful with this setting .
according to the input , the output of the exported application can also be re@@ directed . there are two types of output : normal output , written to the standard output ; error messages sent to the standard output . it can be specified , which is to be done with the text written on the standard output , by setting the value the selection box output :
if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to sub@@ divide the tags in logical groups . it is necessary to create your own tool@@ box for each group . in given case , there are not too many , so you can create a toolbar with the name of the pop@@ up .
once a toolbar has been added , you will need to add and configure actions . select Pre@@ ferences Promo@@ tions .
the parts of this window are pretty self explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode .
fill out all necessary fields and add the tag to the appropriate toolbar .
complete everything and , if the tag has attributes and you are planning to use it , enable dialog &quot; Edit tag &quot; if available so that you can enter the action when using the action .
Ig@@ itt ! is this an ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? let us replace it before we have difficulty .
to create a symbol that represents the action better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; select from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Graphics more programs ( or where else it is located in your distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ current ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size others .
please note that the created symbol will not only help you remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
with regard to the start of the day , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green will mostly be as loose , star@@ te , further interpreted ) , or at least , a message to the user will be sign@@ aled that clicking this symbol will be displayed ; starting ; -@@ day in the current document is inserted .
after the creation of the symbol it must still be connected to the action . this happens through the menu with Pre@@ ferences actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selecting the desired action . in addition to the text field is a button , press it .
select the folder where the saved symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the App@@ ly button and continue using other tags , so there are some or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some usual &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; functions to the toolbar or it should be divided into several groups for a better overview by some separ@@ ators . open the tool bar dialog via Settings tool bar . make sure the desired toolbar is selected .
I want to select the separ@@ ator ( at the top left ) for my toolbar . after selecting the element which is to be added to the toolbar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the toolbar .
for example , I want to preview a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add it to the toolbar .
please note how the separ@@ ators support group@@ ing . someone who does not know my toolbar might believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button is the opposite of the start button .
the new toolbar must be tested by using all symbols to make sure everything works .
after rel@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be created in the root folder , but your tool@@ bars ( s ) should be stored in the correct folder . please adjust their descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c , so that their toolbar ( s ) will be loaded ( ) if a file is opened by the appropriate type .
perhaps the most chosen extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user it is possible to add documentation for scrip@@ ting language or format@@ ting language that you like most . that &apos;s why this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; -@@ Docum@@ entation tree for my personal use .
before starting your own documentation , you could check in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory if someone has already done that for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to search for an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc ; language . then you need to create the doc@@ r@@ c file .
# K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = path , relative to this file , to the documentation html files e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the Main Index = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , tag@@ 1 , tag@@ 1 , tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 3.@@ html
the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , you can see now in the &amp; PHP ; documentation like this :
documentation = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element element = PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Get@@ ting Star@@ ted , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = index@@ .@@ html Get@@ ting Star@@ ted = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tac@@ .@@ html ...
note the # before Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folders in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the depth of the shaft ( except by reason ) m@@ das@@ h ; but try it out for yourself .
you will notice that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequ@@ enti@@ ally at the top of the tree view &amp; m@@ das@@ h ; folder is displayed ! ) .
spaces influence nothing , but pay attention &amp; lt ; notes . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; resources files are replaced .
the content section is the area of the doc@@ r@@ c file that functions for creating context sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; script ends the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function . there are only two types of entries here : the Cont@@ ext@@ List and the file connection lines .
a simple list of Con@@ text @-@ separated context elements that are to be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can easily save your doc@@ r@@ c file to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc for local and global use . then create a folder ( as specified in your doc@@ r@@ c ) in the same folder as doc@@ r@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there .
if you are sure that these are good and worth being shared , send your doc@@ r@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation was used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; community . they will not be rich , but proud to have worked with the best web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you are not alone . it is possible to share the scattered resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with promotions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent by e @-@ mail to friends , partners or anyone else . there is an email @-@ send menu entry , such as the DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , send tool bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the template and in the scripts tree .
the resources can be uploaded into our main archive , where all the other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus users can download them . we recommend that the contributions are reviewed and only available if our team uses them as correct and useful for publication . to contribute to a lon@@ ge@@ vity post , we recommend that resources are provided , both for our team and for the future users .
when up@@ loading , you are asked for your private G@@ PG key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event that you have multiple keys , you can choose one . in the New Resource dialog the input fields have to be filled ( URL preview can remain empty ) and by clicking on OK to start up@@ loading .
up@@ loading can be up@@ loading from the DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) menus , upload tool bar toolbar and start in the context menu of files and folders in the template and script tree .
after downloading a resource , before installation , investig@@ ates &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signature . if the integrity is given and the resource is properly signed , a message appears with the name of the resource .
it is possible to work on XML languages that are currently not created by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , but creation may be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files could be needed in tag XML format .
the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D Load and Con@@ ver@@ ting a DT@@ D . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the DT@@ D description that should be used . then the following dialog appears :
target directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! Doc@@ type Defini@@ tions line : the string that in ! Doc@@ type Tag , such as HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e@@ .d@@ t@@ d will be published
fine adjustment of D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if enabled , adds &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after converting the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are some key concepts . to be able to understand these and to draw the full benefit of and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , one must first famili@@ ari@@ ze themselves with these fundamental concepts . this chapter tries to explain these concepts to them without their understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the working area is divided into three areas : global , locally and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
global elements are available for anyone who uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; all that is marked as global is stored in the shared folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this allows the group of administrators to secure different tool boxes , actions and patterns in the global tree , which are then available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment at the system .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development tools for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user in person .
project @-@ related elements are available only within a particular project . this can be anything from &amp; CSS ; -@@ patterns to tool@@ bars with special actions especially for the files of a particular project . simply said this is the most constra@@ ined size . all elements are filed in the folder tree of the project , which allows the sharing of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the editor window , the building views , the map rows with information and the tool@@ bars . please consult and for further information on these areas .
you can click the file leader with the right mouse button to get a pop@@ up menu with the current document , rel@@ o@@ ad , delete or upload the document , jump to a bookmark or run CVS commands to the current document .
right click in the editor area to a further context menu regarding the processed document content , such as basic editing steps ( cut / paste / paste ) , editing the tags located under the mouse @-@ cursor or opening the file when the string is called a file under the mouse cursor .
at the top of the editor window , the editors of the editor are located . currently , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as standard , for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . as part of the further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and related user requirements .
the use of tool boxes is really easy . if you want to insert a simple tag , e.g. &amp; lt ; paste into your document , then click on the icon that represents the tag . if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes ( like anchor ) , you can fill in a dialog boxes .
the construc@@ tional views ( Q@@ IT ; ) enable to navigate in the information to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to navigate , open them and ro@@ am them . in the presentation with flash drives are available for files , project , sample templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation tree views .
project Management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this view displays all the files in the project and allows the management of the files in the project by right mouse click . actions such as adding , removing , up@@ loading or del@@ eting the files from the storage medium can be done with the displayed context menu .
another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : images , program parts , a whole web page &amp; etc .
templates can be divided into three categories depending on where they are used . the category depends on the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; work area . global templates are always available , local templates can only be used in projects .
here you will find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can access the available information to a script . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can access the available information to a script .
this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking an element a list of commands will open in relation to navigation and refres@@ her the tree .
this tree appears under the other tree views . it can quickly alter attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces with it . the content @-@ oriented contribution system allows you to change all available attributes with just a few mouse clicks .
here is the complete documentation on the web technique for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , by qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &apos; documentation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project , project @-@ specific documentation can be added , edited and considered .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , two boxes at the bottom of the window , can be accessed via the beneficial information : the message window and the problem window .
this map shows information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and any changes to the DT@@ D are displayed .
this tab shows all errors in the current document mark@@ up . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ scripts that are executed give all error messages ( as there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; tool boxes are extensively expanded and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they get the corresponding command . the choc@@ ol@@ ates page of the toolbar is the option to define your own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool@@ box with email . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; sends the tool bar as compressed T@@ ar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; . if they receive a toolbar in an email , they can backup and load them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
it is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus files on your system . to do this , auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help . the options are simple to understand and not executed here .
if you have problems starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 is located in P@@ AT@@ H in front of your bin folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; .
qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE interface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
while the effort to create the best &amp; HTML editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus began to deal with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus would do ? well , this would make him the absolute greatest web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer on pure &amp; HTML ; limited , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; well already well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summari@@ zed : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , for this the suitable &amp; IDE ; be .
now , to the above claim must be stated that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; developer community based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; follows , in good application of free software , the idea of Why develop , what someone else has developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; it allows users and developers to expand as they need it for their needs .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; allows web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can increase productivity dramatically . by using self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , it can increase productivity , without notic@@ ing any scrip@@ ting syntax . ( read more about it in . )
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development and quickly expanded to a mature editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GP@@ L @-@ licensed version and produced a commercial program .
for more details , refer to help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or use k@@ help@@ mate help : / Qu@@ anta ) .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and supported by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it , but the oldest record is taken out .
this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . if you try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only one error is reported .
converts any special characters to &amp; HTML for inser@@ ting from the clip@@ board , so that they are displayed correctly and are not mis@@ understood by the browser as format@@ ting instructions .
converts the text from the clip@@ board in &amp; URL ; -@@ Sch@@ eme which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . primarily used to insert &amp; URL ; s used in the anchor tag .
switches the block selection on or off . this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift key .
goes directly to a line number . this is very useful if your &amp; PHP ; -@@ script puts out error messages !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a type gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window where you can see the display of scripts and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
start and start the problem re@@ porter at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window . the problem re@@ porter is activated as soon as you switch to the structure tree .
displays the toolbar at the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
if there are book@@ marks in the current file , it will appear in the menu along with entries previous or next depending on the cursor position in the document .
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu grouped according to the filen@@ ame of other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard drive . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Projects are stored with the extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
searches the project directory for new files that might be there . it allows you to copy graphics files to your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project .
loads the files in your project to the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and if you have downloaded more input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
settings , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , manages the project . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Projects you will find the details explained .
loads a project toolbar . these are stored in Project Tools / Tool@@ bars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your tool@@ bars . allows you to select the type of tool bar : locally or project .
opens a dialog to add a new toolbar . this creates only the name . actions must be saved by means of actions ... or you will be asked to store tool@@ bars on the toolbar , or you will be asked to save the toolbar .
removes a tool bar from the field of view . it does not delete it from the hard drive . if you have not saved the toolbar , you will be asked if you want to do that .
this allows you to send your own toolbar to someone ( maybe to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; team , so that the tool bar is available in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as app@@ endi@@ x .
allows you to upload tool boxes to the main server , where everyone else can access it . see in .
download one &amp; DT@@ D ; that you or someone else made and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own description format .
load / refresh the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P are to be refres@@ hed , without renew@@ ing the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and a write permission in the global K@@ DE folder is not present fails the load fails .
this menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded toolbar . if the default ( HTML ; ) toolbar is loaded , there is a sub@@ menu standard in the Tags menu , which contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar .
allows access to the current day settings dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in the Tags , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub @-@ menus .
activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the intelligent insertion of tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ ting means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; inser@@ ting by tool bar refuses , if this day contradic@@ ts the rules .
in the Plugins menu , the available plug@@ ins are listed under the above mentioned menu items . click on them to activate it .
select syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schemes depends on the current file .
choose the type of line @-@ end identi@@ fier . very useful when you know people who use other OS platforms to develop . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
veri@@ fies the syntax of the current document based on the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; using the external application ti@@ dy .
immediate switching between the different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , switching over sometimes may need time or create unpleasant graphics . it is recommended the flash@@ card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode , which corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu provides an entry for each open sub@@ window . selecting an entry will enable the corresponding sub@@ window .
to@@ gg@@ les the status bar display at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window on or off .
the changes in this dialog will affect any application that uses the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser .
direc@@ ts the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of &amp; k@@ ate ; find details .
a dialog appears where you delete entries from the tool@@ bars or add them and change the sequences .
this should generate a help in line with the mouse poin@@ ter environment but is not implemented yet .
and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form , they find the way here .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should preferably be filled from top to bottom , since , for example , after completing the project name , the entire directory structure will be completed automatically for the rest of the project . all these paths and author information fields can later be set using Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties .
here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name , the file will be filled in automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . by default it has the name of the project in lo@@ wer@@ case letters and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( eg foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you enter the server address of the machine you want to access , except you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exempl@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the chosen protocol are used . depending on the remote host setting , an adjustment could be necessary .
this is the folder where templates are saved for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder where the tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this allows to insert files from the local file system into the project . multiple files or entire folders can be selected .
this setting is great if you have static web content that you want to download and change . in server @-@ side scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to go differently .
checked if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be mounted . if a project is started from scratch , don &apos;t hook .
with this option all files and folders within the main folder will be displayed and you can make an exact selection according to your own discretion .
this displays a list of files in the root folder . you can select the desired files by hook or by removing the bun@@ ny from the project .
the last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be uploaded in the Project Properties menu in the menu tree in the sub@@ window Pro@@ files or modified using the Shift ; F@@ 7 key short@@ cut .
some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of filen@@ ames ( plac@@ eholders possible ) , which are ignored in project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
additional option to the top , also files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore , are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded when the project is opened , can be read more about project views .
this allows the desired de@@ bu@@ gger to be selected . currently , only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin can be set using the Options button .
up@@ loading profiles can be set in the Pro@@ files window ( see in ) as well as the display of a tree view for the content of the server for each profile by checking its own tree view for each profile .
in the team configuration sub@@ window , project members can be added , edited or deleted , as well as a mailing list . see the details .
in the event configuration sub@@ window , one can turn event actions and add , modify or delete actions . event actions are executed when a pre @-@ determined event occurs , such as securing a file . see the details .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus opens ; the last project that was open . it is not possible to influence this behavior at the moment .
to open another project , choose Open Project ... from the Project menu or the project icon Open from the toolbar . the dialog project will be displayed and allows selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension .
when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; closed , the project file is automatically saved . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files will be found . the same happens when you load a new project .
the project supervis@@ or gives free access to the files in the project . there the files can be managed in the current project .
folders behave as well , but the entries are missing and opened with ... in the right mouse button context menu :
different profiles can be selected here . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files . see .
allows removal of the current profile . if only one profile is present , the button will be bl@@ ended to prevent the removal .
the password will be kept in the core memory and forgotten in program memory . this option is useful when frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary and the rather in@@ secure password stored on the disk option does not come into question .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog when you change your mind before up@@ loading .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , many upload profiles can be created and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed :
this is the server name on which the files should be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs can choose .
the port for the transfer . normally this does not need to be changed except the network administrator does not run a service at the usual port .
depending on your fear threshold , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use it at your discretion . the password is stored on the disk so that it cannot be easily read , but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text .
a project view is just a set of files and tool@@ bars . there can be lots of views in a project , i.e. by simply changing the view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars .
views can be saved , opened or deleted from the Project or Project toolbar , accessible via the toolbar of the toolbar project toolbar .
this chapter describes the parts of and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , with which one has the most to do . this not only helps increase productivity , but also allows the adaptation of and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus to its own working method .
as already mentioned above are tool boxes in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; best designed via the Tools menu . use and addition differ . adding tool bar is treated at the bottom of the section Add tool bar .
the toolbar and the icons can be set either by context menu ( right @-@ click on the toolbar ) , in which you can remove other actions such as tool@@ bars , ren@@ ame tool@@ bars , or set tool@@ bars where specified , which actions should be visible on this or other tool@@ bars .
by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a toolbar , the entries will also be removed and action processed , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the toolbar and the actions on them can be set up in the Tools menu with Settings ... and setting actions .
the templates are basically like a usual fil@@ esystem with advanced organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or link any directory existing to the system into the template tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , in about the limitations that one presents for the file system .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , supplied templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions set at the beginning of each template before use accurately .
binary templates are usually included in documents using short@@ cuts ( e.g. pictures with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates .
documents can be written by any text document type . based on these templates , new documents can be created . normally , more special documents are written in corresponding sub@@ folders . a simple framework for the purpose and arran@@ ges the work in an appropriate way to be efficient . some examples may be found in the template tree under global templates . see for more information on the template tree .
these templates are useful if not a new document based on a template but the same text area should be inserted in the documents again and again . you can find everything from a comment on a final note to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl @-@ based . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . see for more information about the template tree .
as the name says , these templates serve as templates for entire websites . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , combined in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
create a document structure at will ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and select File As templates Save as local template ....
once this is done , you will notice that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look in the template tree under project templates .
select text in your document and click File As Tem@@ plate to save selection as local / project template . alternatively , the selection can easily be drag@@ ged with drag@@ ging and dropping onto the tree view templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be copied to a template folder . it can be used to use all file management functions for it , such as drag@@ ging and dropping or past@@ ing over the Kon@@ quer@@ or file tree .
you can click on a folder in the file tree or in the project file to select a folder on the right and create a site template , enter a name for the template and secure it . by default , it is saved in the project folder , but of course it can be stored as a local or global template .
project templates enable a very goal @-@ oriented approach . you can set he@@ aders and foot@@ ers or dynamically connect with &amp; PHP ; create , insert files or link them with them . in addition , you can keep track of some things when using templates in projects .
the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files submitted in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates .
in order to specify the behavior of a folder , right click on the folder and select Properties from the context menu . the following dialog appears :
a drop @-@ down sel@@ ector with the three types described above ; files , text or templates . this selection is bl@@ ended once the attributes have been inherited .
this is enabled by default and fits all except the root folders in the template overview . if a root folder is set like that , it would be explicitly enabled in this path unless they were explicitly enabled . in case of a normal folder the bla@@ h would appear with something like text @-@ module . if nothing appears , you probably are in a root folder .
allows a pre @-@ set or copied text for templates in this folder . this could be general he@@ aders or foot@@ ers for all templates for a specific project and , by copying contents templates to a folder with special he@@ aders / foot@@ ers , can already be equipped with the appropriate he@@ aders / foot@@ ers .
in addition , you have a context menu ( Show right mouse button ) over a full command collection for adding folders or copy and paste template from one place to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; provides two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source code editor , which can be accessed through the View menu . the first mode replaces the source text editor by the V@@ PL ; editor and the second one spl@@ its the editor window into two parts : the source code editor and the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document such as a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ page and a cursor appears . then you can edit and turn back to the source code editor when necessary , in which the changes implemented in the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor are visible in the source code .
when working with the V@@ PL ; editor in a document containing &amp; PHP ; a small green icon displays the V@@ oh@@ and@@ header of &amp; PHP ; source code . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; editor . to edit &amp; PHP , the source code editor is still necessary . there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works just like the first one , except that the changes are visible both in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor , and the cursor is active in the source code editor and in the V@@ PL ; this mode is activated , this mode moves the active cursor from one window to another , maintaining the position in the document .
the synchronization distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source code editor can be set via Set@@ anta . after choosing V@@ PL , you can choose between synchronization after one click or automatically . in principle , the recommendation is : a small span for fast computers and a large span for slow .
let &apos;s assume that you want to change the title of the website , so the editing of invisible tags is possible when working with the V@@ PL ; editor . the document properties dialog is also called when a new document with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor is created .
met@@ a tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . a click on the list allows you to change the content , e.g. keywords on the name and keyword keywords on the contents column .
CSS rules are the new way of looking pages in your browser . you can add or delete CSS rules using the buttons under the list . a change over the list is possible just as with the met@@ a elements . editing CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file open button and selecting the appropriate file .
using the cursor is possible like in a word processor , because of moving with arrows . under rare circumstances , the cursor beha@@ ves as usual . text can be inserted by typing and deleted using call@@ back or Rem@@ ove button .
inser@@ ting tags is done in the same way through the tool@@ bars , as in the source code editor . it must be noted that inser@@ ting tags pre @-@ existing tags is not removed , e.g. when an anchor tag is inserted , surrounded with text , any other floating anchor tag must be removed .
some tool@@ bars like the sp@@ read@@ sheet assistant or the list wizard are disabled . they will later work in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists need to be used tool@@ bars .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for examining style sheets . unlike other style sheets , the search for certain elements is possible and the style of style can be followed .
to comp@@ iling &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; compile successfully , except &amp; k@@ de ; still the lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and Lib@@ XML libraries , which are already available for a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de .
new in x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in the g@@ db compatibility mode , orph@@ aned support points can be set in a specified file and line number and enabled later .
x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g returns the full path from a file name without a path . filen@@ ame in the same folder as the top loaded style template file name with relative path to working folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g is loaded , for example , a style template file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l , the following entry is possible :
in this command , a partial or complete accord is checked with a template named QNAP or a specified model name . &amp; eg ; template matches any QNAP NAS that contains the template template .
each nam@@ esp@@ ace named &quot; QNAP &quot; will be extended following the rules defined by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file . x@@ s@@ l : test@@ 1 will be extended to ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 19@@ 9 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1

there are many graphical tools to compare . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain briefly why I wrote .
the merge was very complicated , because one of the contribut@@ ors made many changes and at the same time corrected the ind@@ entation at many places . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file .
the program I used showed me only the changed lines , but I could not see what had changed within these lines . and there was no clu@@ es to the places where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . merging these changes was a small night@@ mare .
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could represent differences within a line and changes to white characters . later , a lot of other useful functions were added .
for example , if you want to quickly compare text , simply copy it to the clip@@ board and paste it into one of the comparison windows .
a function that made a lot of work was the same and merging of folders . this function converted &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost to a full @-@ fle@@ dged file browser .
this is useful when two persons work independently from one piece of code and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps to resolve conflicts and simultaneously shows the expected result . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . the screen shot shows three source files when merging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you to compare and merge complete folders . this screen shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in the folder :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; displays the exact differences and contrasts with the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you need to check code frequently , you will like this function .
differences in white characters and tab@@ s are displayed visible . if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters , one can see it at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no more trouble if Som@@ e@@ one changes the ind@@ entation . )
if a file is the same , and the other one differs in one line , the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both are different .
if all files have the same name but are in different folders , then you can ease typing by writing only the filen@@ ame of the first file . for example :
1 Fol@@ der 1 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 folder 1 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder
open dialog enables manual typing of file names , selecting a file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a last opened file from the drop @-@ down list . the Open dialog will remember your selection and will show it again next time . you don &apos;t have to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C empty , analyzing the differences with two files will be performed .
via the Fol@@ der Button ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the same or merge of folders is initiated . if a file is selected for A , but for B and C a folder , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file name from A in the other two folders .
when merging is checked , the input field is active for target and can be edited . however , it is not absolutely necessary to immediately specify an output file . you can also do this later when saving .
the Setup dialog opens a dialog with Settings . here you can set options before starting the same / merge .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to drag text parts from the clip@@ board into the active comparison window . the comparison begins immediately . in Open dialog you do not need to select files , you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel button .
you can also use drag and drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it drop over a comparison window .
what is the idea behind it ? sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , it would be a relatively big effort . you just need to create two appropriate files , load them in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then you can easily copy , paste and compare the relevant sections .
note : currently , you can remove nothing from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only dropping text into a comparison window is supported .
warning : some editors interpret drag and drop text into another program than cutting and past@@ ing ( instead of copying and past@@ ing ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost .
the info line of the source pane contains the characters A , B or C , the filen@@ ame and line number of the first visible row in the window . ( note that Windows C is optional . ) Each info line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , let the mouse take a while over the line . then a little help window will display the full name . )
the three source windows are assigned the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these default settings can be changed via the Settings menu . )
if a difference is detected , you can see the color which is different . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files . that &apos;s good to see in the next section ( merging ) .
if differences have been found , the color displays the corresponding color . in some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( for C / C + + , for example , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in few rare cases . )
the vertical line separating the composite column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no lines . if the line breaks are checked , the line on broken lines is displayed .
the result window ( under the comparison windows ) also has an info line with the wording Output : , the filen@@ ame and &#91; changes &#93; if you edited the result . usually , it contains already text by automatically merging , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved , saving is down@@ lighted ! ! ! ( use the S@@ prin@@ ge buttons to the next resolved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
when only two comparative windows are used , each difference must also be resolved manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in the summary column in one of the windows the group belonging to the row is marked in all windows and the first row of the group will be shown . ( this will also highlight a jump of position in the windows , where the beginning of the group otherwise would not be visible . ) This group will be highlighted with the color background color for current pane and each on the left appears a black bar .
sometimes there is no more row left in the group through automatic merging or manual editing ; then the text &amp; lt ; no row in the box ; this is just a plac@@ eholder for the case that you change your mind and maybe choose another source again . this text does not appear in the final saved file , nor in a selection you might copy and paste somewhere else .
the text &amp; lt ; merge conflict ; however , appears in the clip@@ board , if you copy such text from the result window . be careful with this function .
note : when selecting the sources the options ignore numbers or ignore Ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters .
navigate in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys left , right , high , down , side down , beginning , end , str@@ g start and str@@ g end , Si@@ w as you are used by other programs .
in the output window , you can also use the other buttons for editing . using the In@@ sert button , you can switch between insert and over@@ write mode . ( default is the insert mode . )
a click with the left mouse button in one of the summ@@ aries synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as already explained in the merge and the edi@@ table output window has been explained ) .
the toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ trl @-@ down / C@@ trl @-@ above ) , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ trl @-@ Down / C@@ trl @-@ Down ) or to the next / previous un@@ resolved conflict . therefore , differences between resolved and un@@ resolved conflicts must be distinguished .
to copy the selection to the clip@@ board , you need to press the Copy button ( C@@ trl @-@ C or C@@ trl @-@ Pa@@ ste ) . there is also the option selection automatically copy . if this is checked , whatever you select , is automatically copied to the clip@@ board and copying the manual copy . be careful with this option , because you could acci@@ dentally over@@ write the contents of the clip@@ board .
line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix variants use a new@@ line character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use cart recovery + line feed \ \ r \ . K@@ diff@@ 3 does not retain the line ends of source files , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not using bin@@ aries .
the options and the list of the last used files will be automatically saved during the end and restored at the next start . ( Set up Settings &gt; ... )
select a font with fixed width . ( on some systems the dialog also places fonts with variable width , but you should not use them . )
if you enable this option , differences will be displayed in ital@@ ics . if the chosen type@@ face does not support this display , nothing happens .
in systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form , but would be ro@@ ast@@ ly represented . on these systems , the Pre@@ ferences button automatically introduces an un@@ just color .
if this option is checked , the corresponding number of spaces is inserted when pressing the tab key . otherwise , a tab character will be inserted .
when you press Enter or Return , the previous line ind@@ entation will be used automatically for the next line .
when this option is enabled , each selection is automatically copied to the clip@@ board . copying the manual into the clip@@ board then drops .
you can select which line type you prefer for saving . the default value is the commonly used selection on the operating system used .
when comparing files , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first to find all fully identical lines in source files . only during this first step white characters can be ignored . the second step compar@@ es each line . in this step white characters are ignored . even when merging , white characters are ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) save a carriage return character &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a line feed &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , but then files with different sizes may look identical in page @-@ to @-@ page comparison , although they are treated differently .
in default , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored .
in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters .
intensive search for even smaller differences . the option is enabled by default . it is effective with complicated and large files , but slowly with very large files .
in automatic jump mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict will continue .
this is useful if white characters are less important in many files . if you need this only from time to time , then use the Select A / B / C functions for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the merge menu . note that the automatic selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments when the options ignore numbers or ignore Ig@@ nor@@ er C / C + + comments .
these options are discussed in the chapter for scanning of folders and exec@@ uting a merge . refer to the comparison and merge documentation for details under documentation .
if a file is stored and already an older version exists , the original version will be app@@ ended to suff@@ ix .@@ or@@ g . if such a backup file exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further backup .
adjust the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the currently running program . you need to quit &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; quit and restart , so that the change is active . ( this option is available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because language is set globally via the control center . )
the following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry . if you enable this option , the upper setting is used for all entries .
above the selection fields for encoding a short notice appears , which is the local encoding . ( this can not be changed here and has for you purely informal character . )
customize the file encoding for source files . this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted . since the encoding for each file is individually adjustable , even files with different encoding can be compared and merged .
if you have edited a file , you can specify which encoding to use for saving .
if you define processing commands , you might not be able to work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files could be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre@@ processing command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can set the encoding of output command commands .
turn this off to supp@@ ress high@@ lighting of changes in white characters in text or review columns . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore Ig@@ ignor@@ es C / C + + comments . )
this selection is only available when you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences between two of three files are displayed . however , sometimes you might want to see only the differences between two of three files . after selecting A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; B , A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C will display next to the normal still a second sur@@ est column with the information you need .
sometimes you would like to use the available space on the screen for long lines . just exit the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes you view the differences and then decide to merge the files . a simple click starts the merge and uses the file name of the last source file as default name for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart the merge , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . )
when reading a file , it is first passed to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command becomes visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre@@ processor that meets your requirements . you can use this function , for example , to cut out disturbing parts or correct the ind@@ entation .
when reading a file , it will first be passed to this external command . if a normal processing command was specified ( see above ) , the output of the command is used only by line synchronization . you can write your own pre@@ processor that meets your requirements . each entry line must have a corresponding output line .
the idea behind this is to give the user more flexibility when setting up the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is needed , and most users do not want to program it themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases the sed or per@@ l is perfect .
the \ \ 1 \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
all follow the same pattern $ keyword @-@ generated text $ \ \ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you experiment with sed , you might start to understand it and perhaps you may even like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for a further pre @-@ processing command for line comparison . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Every sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and every hit is replaced by nothing , so basically deleted .
sometimes you might want to perform several replac@@ ements at one time . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the replac@@ ements from one another . for example :
instead of sed you can also use something else such as per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos; s / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / replacement / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos; How@@ ever , per@@ l needs some details . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) is needed , per@@ l needs only ( and ) without the preceding &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal pre@@ processor is maintained for displaying and merging . the other operations only change the data that the line @-@ like algorithm looks like .
note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the line equivalent pre@@ processor will display the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hides differences , you may acci@@ dentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data .
often programmers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; whole folders recur@@ sively .
... makes a proposal for each object to merge ; you can adjust the proposal before starting ,
... can simulate the merge and display the simulated changes without actually performing it ,
... performs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to comparing and merging individual files . you only need to specify folders on the command line or in the File dialog .
if three folders are merged , folder 1 will be used as a base . if no destination folder has been specified , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as destination folder .
note that only the comparison of folders will start automatically , not merging . to start merging , you must select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( see more details . )
when you read the folder , you will be informed a small message window about the current progress . if you cancel the scanning of the folders , only the files that have been compared until then will be listed .
when scanning the folder is finished , it shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window showing the results on the left side , ...
each file and folder found during the scan will be displayed in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually shown folded up . you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - or double @-@ clicking on the object or by double @-@ clicking the arrow keys for left and right . the directory menu contains two functions to open all sub@@ directories and open all sub@@ directories with which you can open and open all folders .
double @-@ clicking on a file will start the file comparison and a comparison window will appear .
the symbol in the name column reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) again . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders , then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object . if the merge operation is started , you will be notified of any problems of this type .
as shown in the picture above , the colors red , green , yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C .
for identical entries , however , the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different .
folders are considered identical , if their entire contents are identical . then also folders have the same color . in folders , age is ir@@ relevant for its color .
the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ diff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf which is only green , then becomes yellow and later when it is old , red becomes .
... A and C are identical , but not B : copy B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical , but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical , but not A : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same file type ( for example , if A is a folder and B is a file ) : errors : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such er@@ ron@@ eous objects exist , merging cannot be started .
... A and B do not have the same file type ( for example , if A is a folder and B is a file ) : errors : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such er@@ ron@@ eous objects exist , merging cannot be started .
the syn@@ cing mode is active when only two folders and no explicit target folder have been specified , and if the option synchron@@ ize dir@@ s is active . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action so that both folders are identical . if for one entry ...
... A and B exist but are not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible file names for the output file only B ; directly copied &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
when two folders are merged and the option New file instead of merging ( unsure ) is enabled , then check &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of the files and suggests the newer file to copy . if the files are different but the date is identical .. As long as such errors are not removed , merging the folders cannot be started .
while merging , one file is processed after another . the Status column shows skill when merging is successful , and according to other messages when something unexpected occurs . when merging is completed , you should make a final check and see if the status is all right .
if the file comparison method is selected in the Setup dialog , K@@ diff@@ 3 will display more columns . these contain the number of un@@ resolved , deleted , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged . )
you can either merge the just selected entry ( file or odd ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the merging actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start merging .
please note : if you do not specify a destination folder , then in the Three folder Mer@@ ger mode C is used as the target , when two folder mer@@ ges B is chosen as the target and when synchron@@ izing A and / or B is used as the destination .
if you have selected a destination folder , please check if all the entries that should be in the destination folder can also be displayed in the folder structure . there are some options by which certain entries can be ski@@ pped . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises :
to merge all entries : select directory merge / continue in the menu menu or press F@@ 7 ( the keyboard short@@ cut ) . to merge only the current entry , select action from the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if invalid file types still exist invalid merge @-@ actions , a message appears that indicates the faulty elements . you can then select a valid action for them .
when you merge all the entries , a dialog box with the options will appear , simulate and Cancel .
select Sim@@ ulate if you want to see what would happen without actually making any changes . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then perform certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , a merge window opens ( note the screen@@ shot ) .
once you have finished with a file , select / continue / continue directory merge or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved yet , a corresponding dialog appears . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; continue its work with the next entry .
at the end of the list , you will see some error messages that will help you to check the cause of the problem . if you continue merging ( F@@ 7 key ) , it lets you choose another action for the entry or solve the problem in a different way before proceeding with the merge .
if a number of entries have been combined individually , the entries ( in the current session ) will not be combined again . even if the merge has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries will be considered completed . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( Set up menu Set@@ ting - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 ... ) has now a section called directory merging with these options :
only files matching the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree . there can be several patterns entered . separate the pattern with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders must not match this pattern .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
ignor@@ es files that would be ignored by CVS . many auth@@ mati@@ cally generated files are ignored by CVS . the big advantage is that this can be set with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems , files have a hiding attribute . in other fil@@ es@@ ystems , a previous point marks a file as hidden . this option lets you decide if these files are to be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in default .
when the option is turned off , symbolic links are compared . if the option is turned on , the files are compared to which the links show . this is disabled in default .
for links to folders : if the option is turned off , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is turned on , the links will be treated like normal folders and checked recur@@ sively . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; does not lead to possible recur@@ sions ) This option is disabled in default .
performs a complete analysis of each file and displays the stati@@ stic columns . ( the number of resolved , un@@ resolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files containing no text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare large folders over a slow network , it might be faster to compare only the change date and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you some degree of security . please use caution . this option is switched off in default .
the files are considered identical , if they are identical . this can be useful , for example , when copying the change date . please use caution . this option is switched off in default .
activ@@ ates syn@@ cing mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder is specified . in this mode , the suggestions for merging are selected in such a way that afterwards both folders are identical . also the results of merging files are stored in both folders .
if there are differences , instead of merging it will be suggested copying the newer file as action . ( this is considered uns@@ af@@ e because it will check the knowledge that the other file has not been changed either . ) This option is disabled in default .
if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another backup file , the original version will be renamed to .@@ orig@@ . If an old backup file exists with the .@@ ori@@ g extension , it will be deleted without further backup . this also applies to the normal merge of individual files , not only the merge of entire folders . this option is enabled in default .
normally the folder mer@@ ges view remains visible while merging individual files ; you can switch the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want this , you can switch the main window in the window menu and switch between the two views by switching between the directory &amp; text window .
you can also directly merge a single file without first having to run the folder . as soon as you save the result , the status will be checked and the file will not be merged once you start the folder .
this status is lost , however , if you re @-@ read the directory : directory menu : re @-@ read
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ DE uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders to open which are located on local or remote hosts .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder inside a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders . you should note a few things :
a path can be relative and@@ . or .. included . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute .
special characters must be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , spaces &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file has the name / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes through the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations :
or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows . then a file is always accepted as a link target . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no way to edit permissions or change dates . therefore , the permissions or the modification date devi@@ ate from the original . ( note the option Trust of Size . ) ( This is only possible for local files . )
the main purpose of use is currently the difference viewer in K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP . K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP starts first of all the built @-@ in differences viewer . to start be@@ diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button on the difference viewer and then select In K@@ VI@@ DE@@ 3D@@ Part display from the contex@@ tual menu .
normally , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; 2 complete input files . if it is applied as a part , it takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files from the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch to restore the missing file .
in Kon@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select Pre@@ view in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu . please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the creation of the patch file .
when &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; executed as part , it only supports comparing two files , a very small toolbar and menu . merging or comparing folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ diff@@ 2 ( now hot comp@@ s ) are already available . in addition , the name K@@ diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can perform together like the diff@@ 3 program from the Di@@ ff Tool collection .
I have been using GP@@ L programs for a very long time and learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs . this is my thanks to all programmers who have gone through this path or that they will go this way .
you compiled the program from the sources and probably didn &apos;t tell the configure script the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in default configure inst@@ alls configure in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE can &apos;t find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file , you will find more information about this topic .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are treated as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line is treated as not identical . i@@ F similar lines , next to each other , this is the attribute this is more often the case .
the editor notices every difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . however , this is necessary to solve a conflict simply by clicking in the source code and selecting the button A / B / C . however , this important information is lost if the result is simply stored as a text file and it is too much effort to create extra a separate file format that might store this information .
you can always restore a particular version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger amounts of text a different editor should be used .
after removing text , suddenly ; no sr@@ c lin@@ ens ; appeared and the text cannot be deleted . what does this mean and how can it be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses already many colors to highlight differences . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using and missing the purpose . please use another editor for this .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later .
information on how to use K@@ DE on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
a list of the last changes can be found at ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the file Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the source package .
to comp@@ ress and install on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; to compile and install , use the following command in the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ Distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ dir returns the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , you will find further details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file .
because &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake use , you should not have problems while comp@@ iling . if difficulties pers@@ ist , please report them to the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mailing lists .
cut out ( C@@ trl @-@ X or Shift Del@@ ete ) copy into the clip@@ board and delete the selected text . insert ( C@@ trl @-@ V or Shift @-@ In@@ sert ) inserts the text from the clip@@ board at the current cursor position and replaces the current selection .
show only differences : files that are identical in all folders will not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the destination folder .
( in the current program version , you need to re @-@ read the folder with the Ref@@ res@@ h function after changes to these options . )
this also causes identical files not to be copied to the destination folder when merging . if the destination folder doesn &apos;t already contain these files , they are missing after merging . ( the behavior will likely be modified in a later program version . ) This option is disabled in default .
note the buttons to select the source with the cap@@ tion A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the rows from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already available ) . if the rows are already present , they will be removed by clicking the button again .
in default , this option is disabled . differences in single characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; displays a mini preview of all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . it is quite practical to see the running programs on the work@@ tops , change their size , end them or shift them . this works both inside a desktop as well as several .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual working areas as well as the applications running it . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others .
with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both within a working area and on other working surfaces .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : if on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the context menu has only the two entries of P@@ ager . when cli@@ cked , the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries minimize , maximize , on work and end . the commands cause the following :
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
if this check box is selected , windows can be moved within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other work@@ tops .
when this field is checked , the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager will display the names of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops .

you can use &amp; K@@ mag . enlarge a part of the screen , as if you read the newspaper a magni@@ fying glass for the small print or the exact viewing of a photo . this application is interesting for various users : these include artists , web designers and people with a visual impair@@ ment . this documentation should be a complete manual for the use of &amp; K@@ mag .
&amp; K@@ mag is a very powerful application that is constantly extended by new features . it is optimized for use on high @-@ performance computers .
when you start &amp; K@@ mag , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; K@@ mag shows the enlarged area of the screen . in the following , this window is called magni@@ fying window . the picture shown in the magni@@ fying window is an enlarged area of the screen and is described in the following as a selection window .
in the default setting &amp; K@@ mag ; the area around the mouse poin@@ ter like a mo@@ ve@@ able lou@@ pe . alternatively , you can add a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( drop@@ down window ) or the environment of the mouse poin@@ ter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; on the left edge of the screen ) .
you want to avoid that the mouse cursor is displayed in the enlarged pane , select the mouse cursor position . please note that the mouse poin@@ ter is still not able to recognize the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the default k@@ de ; / Q@@ t ; poin@@ ter .
in the drop@@ down window you can adjust the selection box to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow keys and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse cursor in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button pressed , so you can capture and move the contents of the magni@@ fying window . this is also done using the arrow keys .
if you additionally press the &amp; Shift key or the &amp; M@@ MB ; use , you can shift the selection box .
this combination allows you to change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the selection window will be fixed and only the lower right corner is to be moved .
you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer , save it to a file , copy it to the clip@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , rotate the image and much more .
starts or stops the update of the display . stopping the update causes the CPU time to go against 0 .
select the update rate ( Very low , Low , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the refresh rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode , a selection window appears . the selected area is displayed in a window .
&amp; K@@ mag ; Automati@@ cally uses your inserted short@@ cuts to store files , open a new window , print , rel@@ o@@ ads ( with the button document re@@ load in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ large and smaller &amp; etc ; .
K@@ mag is also known as a magni@@ fier ; it is a screen lou@@ pe . you can use &amp; k@@ not magni@@ fier ; for this purpose you can use a magni@@ fier to view the small print in a newspaper or photo . this application is useful for different people : from research engineer or artist to web designer or visual disabled .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse @-@ click as soon as the mouse @-@ cursor is waiting for a while at the same place . it is thought to help people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome ( Re@@ peti@@ tive @-@ Stra@@ in @-@ In@@ jury Syndrome ) and that each mouse @-@ click causes pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse @-@ click as soon as the mouse @-@ cursor is waiting for a while at the same place . it is meant to help people who suffer pain at the Re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can circum@@ vent the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , pain caused by the use of your computer may also cause pain .
to make it clear : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic aids , the result can be different for everyone .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and takes a mouse @-@ click away as soon as you break the motion short .
if the intelligent shift activ@@ ates , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a pause after pressing the mouse button is em@@ ulated . move the mouse , wait until the end of the movement before releasing the mouse button . in this way , you can pull the drag@@ ging with pressed mouse button .
this residence time has to be hidden after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click is executed .
when Intel@@ lig@@ ently shift is enabled , the shooting time ( 1 / 10 s ) is activated . here , the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after clicking the mouse button wait before releasing the mouse button again if no moving of the mouse occurs in the meantime .
this function activ@@ ates , creates a slow moving to the right and back , followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . a slow moving to the left and back leads a double click . these movements are stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ .t@@ xt if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the first time is started , but they can be changed later .
if the sound appears delayed , you can &amp; k@@ de ; move to shor@@ ten the response time . go to the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select Sound System and here the tab General . there is a slider Sound Buff@@ ers you set to a lower value to shor@@ ten the response times .
if this setting is selected , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is started ; at each start of &amp; k@@ de ; started . this function is currently only available under &amp; k@@ de ; please refer to the respective documentation for G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments to find out how to start a program automatically there .
set all settings to the values set when the dialog opens . if you already press the App@@ ly button , the settings will be reset to the state after the last push of App@@ ly .
best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with default settings . in particular , the intelligent shift should first be switched off . if you then get used to automatic mouse clicks , you can later remove the intelligent shift .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it may be necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; in case of sounds .
first you should be aware of which places a mouse @-@ click remains without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or in places in the browser window that does not represent a link does not lead to unwanted reactions . you can therefore park the mouse in such places until you want to use them again .
when your mouse is bu@@ cking , you should clean your mouse . this is usually pretty simple . the trick is that you do not only clean the mouse ball , but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball .
first you have to remove the mouse ball . as this happens , mouse is different to mouse . however , it should be clear if you look at the under@@ side of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the wheels . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . dirt and dirt can easily scra@@ pe with a flat blade or the f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail .
in very rare situations , the operating system interrup@@ ts execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you use the smart move in this case , it means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer be terminated by releasing the mouse button .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use under any other window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem is that you own a mouse click . this will reset the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; reset and you can continue to work as usual .
problem : if you type text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to run mouse clicks and put the cursor in another place .
solution : use the mouse to place the cursor to where you want it . but parking the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop , if you want to make a keyboard input . thus , accidental moving of the mouse @-@ cursor can cause unwanted reactions . secure zones for the mouse @-@ cursor are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the tool@@ bars and menus and the title line of windows .
I try to work with the intelligent shift , but I don &apos;t manage to edit lyrics .
the intelligent shift is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes time before you can handle it . it is probably possible to copy text , copy it to the clip@@ board , or to execute any other action where you wish to move the mouse with pressed mouse button .
do not use the intelligent move if you just start using &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use it as follows : at the end of the text area , hold a mouse click and hold the Shift key pressed while you move the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this will each time , when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button expresses a sound like a mouse click away . later , you can use the intelligent shift also without the audi@@ ble mouse click . however , this requires some exercise .
to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X Window needs to be installed . this should be the case on most of the system .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse click is only available when the system has a sound card and speakers and is set up correctly .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; num@@ bs the mouse button as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter freezes . this program has been developed for people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome and which causes pain to be pressed .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured to wait for a certain time to start a pulling operation before releasing the mouse button . in this way , drag@@ ging and dropping with the mouse can also be performed .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program that allows dum@@ b users to let their computer speak for themselves .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; silent users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can select sentences from a list of conversation courses that are to be discussed again .
on the first page of the assistant ( left screen@@ shot ) , enter the command that will be used later for the speech output of text . for more details , see the description of the setup dialog .
on the second page , select the standard text passage book . from the text pass@@ books books , you can often choose text passages without having to type them . the passages can of course be edited .
on the third page ( right screen@@ shot ) you define the dictionary for word tran@@ scription . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of each word . additionally , you can synchron@@ ize the word lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , so that only correctly sp@@ elled words are included in the word tran@@ scription .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and contains essentially an input field for the keyboard input of your sets ( the lower white field in the screen@@ shot ) and an in@@ let memory of the already spoken phrases ( the upper white field in the screen@@ shot ) .
if you have the mouth , you can enter the phrases that you want to hear in the input field . each spoken phrase is app@@ ended to the main memory . you can select phrases that are to be discussed again .
with the menu item Set@@ ting k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the Options dialog from &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog contains two learning flash@@ cards , voice output and settings , page word tran@@ scription , and the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page .
in the input field of the card language output , you enter the command to call the language generator . in the selection box below the input field , specify the encoding , with the text transmitted to the language generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box if the text is to be passed on as standard input to the language generator .
if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed on as a parameter . you can use the following wild@@ cards :
of course , the command for voice output depends on your language generator . you will find this command in the documentation for your language generator . examples of this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x .
use kt@@ ts@@ d as language service &amp; k@@ mouth ; first try to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ D language service . if this is successful , the other settings will be ignored on this page . the kt@@ ts@@ d language service is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ äm@@ on , the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ uses a standardized interface for voice output and which is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . the choice of this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ D is not installed .
the first choice field action after selecting a text passage allows you to determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by selecting a text passage in the Text passage book menu or in the bar for text passage books .
with the selection of Im@@ medi@@ ate the selected text passage is spoken directly and additionally inserted into the main memory . with the selection of In the input field the selected text passage is first entered into the input field .
the second selection box closing the editing window for the text pass@@ book script allows you to specify whether the text match schedule should be automatically saved when closing the editing window .
save the book with the selection of text pass@@ book . if you choose to disc@@ ard changes , the text password book will not be saved . select Before Save , &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text@@ book should be saved .
the word word page contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for word tran@@ scription . in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection box if this list contains more than one dictionary . with this selection box , you can select the currently used dictionary for word tran@@ scription .
with the buttons at the right of the page you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list you can select the name and in the selection box the language for the dictionary .
select the language you want for this source ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then read the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the frequency of each word is easily determined by counting the occurrence . additionally , you can compare the wor@@ d@@ list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert only properly written words into the new dictionary .
with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; queries which dic@@ tion@@ aries are brought together and how they are to be weigh@@ ted .
with this option you create a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly entered words automatically add into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary over time .
the main area of the window for editing text pass@@ books is divided into two . in the upper part , the text passages are presented as tree structure .
in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the associated keyboard short@@ cut . if you have selected a text passage book , you can only change its name .
actions like adding new text passages or books or del@@ eting selected text passages and books can either be accessed through the selection in the menu bar , in the toolbar or through a drop @-@ down menu .
you can change the order of text pass@@ books or text passages by drag@@ ging the mouse over the new location or using the arrow keys and the &amp; alt key .
the selected text is cut out and copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected portions of the disk storage .
the selected text is copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected portions of the disk storage .
the currently active set is spoken . if text is in the input field , it will be used otherwise the selected phrases of the disk will be used .
if this menu entry is checked , a sliding toolbar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed . by default , the toolbar can be moved directly from the editing window under the menu bar . by clicking on the sh@@ aded left side and drag@@ ging the toolbar can be moved to another location .

you probably haven &apos;t entered the command for voice output correctly or not completely . open Set@@ ting k@@ mouth ; setup ... , open the General Settings page and enter the language output command for voice output . ( see settings dialog for speech synthes@@ izer for more details . )
Festival is a language edition system from the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wal@@ sh are supported . the license allows you to use the festival free of charge and without any restrictions .
to display an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival folder . then the command for voice output reads :
Free@@ T@@ TS is an in &amp; Java ; written language generator . currently , it only supports English pron@@ unciation . the license allows you to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and without any restrictions .
to display an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in / usr / local / fre@@ etts . then the voice output is possible with one of the three following commands :
for the third example , the option must be turned on as default input . ( this is the recommended example for the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a voice generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a wave file , therefore you need an additional program to rip the text into phon@@ em@@ es . license allows to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text into phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / jihadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA .
unfortunately H@@ adi@@ f@@ fax likes to swal@@ low the last character of the text so that an additional character has to be added . therefore , the full command is more elaborate than in the other examples :
( cat - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / jihadi@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option to send data as default input must be enabled .
the voice output dem@@ on by &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ wide voice service that provides all &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different voice output systems .
since the setting of the language generator only takes place in the K@@ TT , you only have to use kt@@ ts@@ d as language service in &amp; k@@ mouth ; set .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to setup use the page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ TT@@ SD language service &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which appears in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Options dialog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from &amp; k@@ mouth ; if K@@ TT@@ D is installed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to use it , you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB of memory ( and additionally memory for the language generator ) , but this depends on your computer and its configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application that allows people who cannot speak , can print text through the computer . a list of already scanned sentences is stored , which the user can spend time and again .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; not a voice synthes@@ izer . a voice synthes@@ izer needs to be installed on the computer .
detailed user documentation can be found with help : / k@@ mouth ( enter either this URL in the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; one or start k@@ help@@ desk help : / k@@ mouth ) .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; - the &amp; k@@ de voice output system ; - is a module of an existing service that allows any application to read text about the &amp; d@@ bus ; interface .

speech output is based on the speech @-@ speech program , which uses various background programs such as e@@ Spe@@ ak , festival , &amp; etc .
allows the creation of voice output on the command line ( or with shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; -@@ utility .
in Z@@ UK@@ UN@@ FT : support for Spe@@ ech Mark@@ up languages such as Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Spe@@ ech Mark@@ up Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Spe@@ ech Mark@@ up Met@@ a Language ( SM@@ ML ) .

before you can use it , you need to install speech @-@ speech tool and set it correctly .
for the first start of t@@ m@@ gr or as long as no speakers are set up , the card board speaker is displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker , the card card General will be displayed gener@@ ously .
most T@@ TS Synthes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , as well as various male or female , or those that differ in volume or speed . you should also set up several variants for a synthes@@ izer . you should at least set up a speaker before you use &amp; kt@@ ts ; otherwise the program speed dis@@ pat@@ cher would otherwise use the standard speaker .
several speakers for the same synthes@@ izer are comparable to several printer expectations for the same printer .
if you click on the map leader speaker in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the card board narr@@ ator will appear . this will also appear automatically when you start t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and no speaker is set up .
all speakers already set up appear in this list . the preferred actors appear in the list above . the top speaker is used for voice output if an application does not present a speaker .
select a speaker from the list with a click of the mouse , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list .
select a speaker from the list with a click of the mouse , and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
select a speaker from the list with a click of the mouse , and click on this button to push the speaker in the list one line further down . the order of the speakers in the list also determines their priority .
click on any of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ t ; system .
select a tuning type here , three male and three female voices are available as well as a boys and girls &quot; voice .
if you click here , the new speaker appears on the card board speaker . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit .
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ye ; almost use . go back to the map General and check if voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is enabled , so that the T@@ TS service starts . click on the box card orders to create and manage text jobs . see .
if you have set up at least one speaker , you can launch the &amp; k@@ de voice output system . click the General tab to open this card . here you can set some general options .
select this check box to enable the &amp; kt@@ t ; system . this starts the K@@ DE T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start is successful , the card card is displayed and you can create and read text jobs . see . remove the selection , K@@ TT@@ SD is stopped and the T@@ TS system from &amp; k@@ de ; disabled .
when t@@ m@@ gr ends , runs &amp; kt@@ ts ; continue if the field voice output is checked ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is enabled .
if this check box is selected and t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will appear automatically in the Control bar &apos;s system area , it disappears again as soon as the pre @-@ reading is completed .
with the buttons in this series , you can start , ab@@ ort , pause , and record text jobs .
the buttons in this series allow you to read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; clip@@ board or open a text file for reading . you can also switch the speaker for one job .
click App@@ ly or OK , then all changed settings will be taken on all pages .
the cart@@ on card orders are only displayed when the K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click the Common tab and tick the voice output there ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed web page . first check the text that is to be read and select Text to read in the main menu . after a short time , the speech output should begin .
it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a website . you can skip this step too , but then many &amp; HTML ; -@@ pr@@ elo@@ ads and other invisible marks are also read .
in &amp; k@@ ate ; the extended text editor from &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read displayed text . first check if &amp; kt@@ ts ; runs . then select the text that should be read and select Text Display in the main menu . then the speech output should begin .
this also works if &amp; k@@ ates ; embedded in other applications such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; .
K@@ No@@ tify is the &amp; k@@ de news system , which noti@@ fies you about events you have defined . you can also read &amp; read the text of these messages .
in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the I@@ RC program by &amp; k@@ de ; you can set up different types of messages ; for example , set up that you are notified when a message appears in an I@@ RC channel , where your nick@@ name appears . with &amp; kt@@ ye ; you can then read the I@@ RC message text .
supports a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ No@@ tify , a menu entry will appear in the settings menu of this program . the possible settings for K@@ No@@ tify differ depending on the application .
filter for string replacement provides a good way to correct in &amp; kt@@ h ; wrong st@@ ressing or er@@ ron@@ eous out@@ spoken messages . the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml , which is part of the delivery of &amp; kt@@ ops ; is a good example . it removes the tags b@@ r and b from the messages that K@@ Mail sends , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , as it can be assumed in most cases as pres@@ upp@@ os@@ ed .
filters are one of the advanced features of &amp; kt@@ t ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ops ; filters are not required .
text is edited in filters before being sent to the speech @-@ speech tool . they are useful for improving the pron@@ unciation to replace wrong spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , select a suitable language and speaker , or to avoid certain short@@ com@@ ings of speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
to understand how filters work , it is important to know how the speech @-@ speech program works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ots ; differenti@@ ates four types of texts .
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders . if the output of the screen reader is read , the retained jobs will be continued .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important messages such as &amp; eg ; processor is subject to hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text .
News have the highest priority . a message breaks normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you can read a long text on a website , you can talk to &amp; k@@ mouth ; someone just enters the room .
the rest are simple text orders . every order you get from the card card orders is a text order . K@@ S@@ ay@@ it is an example of an application that uses text commands . text orders are intended for the output of longer texts that do not possess any particular ur@@ gency .
all four order types are processed in queu@@ es , with the exception of the output of Screen Re@@ aders . when an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one of them reads , this output is stopped and stopped .
first you need to know that filters will never be applied to the output of Screen Re@@ aders . they are applied to normal al@@ erts , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages .
filter edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future there can be even more types of filters .
string replac@@ ements replace parts of a text with other text . the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ots ; is supplied with pre@@ defined string replac@@ ements such as : - ) by text or for reform@@ at@@ ting messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understandable way .
&amp; XML ; -@@ reform@@ ers use an X@@ S@@ LT file ( XML ; style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from one format to another format . included are some X@@ S@@ LT files for transl@@ ating &amp; X@@ HTML ; included in SS@@ ML .
with speaker selection filters , you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that has sent the text to &amp; kt@@ h ; for example , if you have set a female voice on the card board speaker , you can read text from K@@ DE messages about it .
each of these different filters has adjustable rules , according to which it is applied for voice output . if the filter detects that its rules do not apply , it will continue the text unchanged to the next filter .
if a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; message is sent , it is processed by all activated filters , which have been set up on the bottom of the page . the processing by the filters is done in the order in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of the normal filters . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter and the further down menu dialog will be displayed below .
for the set @-@ up of string replacement filters , you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison pattern . if these patterns are found in the text , the text will be exchanged for the corresponding replacement text .
enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name arbitr@@ arily ; it only needs to be distinguished from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column matches and replaces it in accordance with the string from the Re@@ place column .
click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list .
with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . load a list from a file , the entries will be app@@ ended from the file to the existing list .
if a language is entered here , the filter will only be applied if the speaker for the text order is one of the languages listed here . click the button to display a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you press the &amp; C@@ trl key .
if a value is entered here , the filter will only be applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separately by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application ID running programs will get you with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; d@@ bus ; numbers must om@@ it you . if for example , and q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID copied @-@ 34@@ 32 , you may only enter copy .
the string replacement filter is only applied to the text when all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter if all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts .
when comparing words , the string replace filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ .
in this manual , you will not find instructions for writing regular expressions . if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can call it in the di@@ alogs add or edit as help to assemble these expressions .
X@@ S@@ LT ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such conver@@ sions . but it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility has to be installed on your system .
enter the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is reachable via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is sufficient .
with the speaker selection filter you can send text to a particular speaker set up on the card board speaker or to a speaker with certain features . you can , for example , set that texts from k@@ mail should be read from a female voice .
before a text is passed to the filter , it looks for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected based on the speaker &apos;s features that the program sends , and the characteristics of the speaker set up on the card board speaker . the speaker selection filter lets you over@@ write the selected speaker .
if a value is entered here , the filter is applied if the text contains the entered regular expression . is installed on your system of &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can call it by clicking on the button to get help when entering .
to achieve faster processing , try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , that is , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
here you specify the characteristics of the desired speaker . if the text meets the filter conditions shown above , the speaker will be selected to match the desired requirements . click the button on the right to see the dialogue selection dialog .
use these buttons to save or load your subscri@@ ber settings or delete all settings .
the speaker selection filter is only applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter if applicable . you must enter at least one condition .
the speech output API , from &amp; k@@ de ; , with which programmers can give their applications T@@ TS skills . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD about &amp; d@@ bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with voice synthes@@ izer can be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so that &amp; kt@@ ts ; this synthes@@ izer can use .
the following section provides a brief description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; interface of the language output API from &amp; k@@ de ; the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on the k@@ de ; Acc@@ essibility website ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / acc@@ essi@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications require voice output services via the &amp; d@@ bus ; interface from &amp; k@@ de ; from the kt@@ ts@@ d program to the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
the text of the text for reading and an option is a language code such as &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are even more commands you can use . for a list of all commands
open two &amp; Con@@ sole ; -@@ Windows . first run t@@ ts@@ d in one window , then ts@@ m@@ gr on the other .
none of the mentioned voice synthes@@ iz@@ ers supports my language . where can I get a synthes@@ izer for my speech ?
I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ Form@@ ing filter , but when using the module for festival websites are not read .
due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you must install the ( male ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone so that S@@ able works at all . you have to do that even if you do not use this voice to read web pages . also make sure the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found through the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H .
certain characters or punc@@ tu@@ ation marks seem to cause errors during the synthes@@ izer , so that whole sets are ski@@ pped or only ch@@ ewing @-@ re@@ inde@@ er is spent . what can I do about it ?
first , make sure that the character encoding option is set to the right value for the corresponding language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , these may be remedi@@ ed by a string replacement filter .

the speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers used by &amp; kt@@ t have their own license , which can be found in the related documentation or on the relevant websites . there are also voices that have their own license .
if you have access to the K@@ DE source code archive , you can download the program , which is download@@ able in the kt@@ ts@@ d folder . you can also find the source code from k@@ de@@ brand@@ .@@ ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de / .
it contains many languages , a list of all currently supported languages can be found on the project page ht@@ t@@ p : / / es@@ pe@@ ak@@ .@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / langu@@ ag@@ es.@@ html .
American English , British , Spanish , German , Finnish , Czech , Polish , Russian , Italian , French , Canadian French , Kis@@ w@@ ah@@ ili , Zul@@ u and Ibi@@ bio .
K@@ T@@ TS works with every voice synthes@@ izer running on the command line in a &amp; Con@@ sole ; it can be started .
the list of languages mentioned above can be incomplete or out@@ dated . therefore , consult the description of the synthes@@ iz@@ ers to the supported languages . check also on the website of kt@@ own ; , according to information which are not yet contained in this manual .
the speech @-@ dis@@ pat@@ cher program uses an adap@@ table module architecture for voice synthes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to expand &amp; t@@ ect ; for the use of a different synthes@@ izer , please contact the development team .
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter but is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c command .
to compile and compile , you need a current development environment from K@@ DE ( Version 3.4 or newer ) including the packages k@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the speech @-@ speech program .
if you have downloaded &amp; downloaded the source code from &amp; kt@@ ye ; from the source code archive for download@@ able or downloaded tar@@ ball every night , compile and install the program with the following commands :
before using &amp; Desktop , check first if speech @-@ dis@@ pat@@ cher works correctly with your speech synthes@@ izer . to do this , you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of speech . the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ g should be developed in such a way that the setup of speech @-@ dis@@ pat@@ cher is directly possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer needed .
a long text is dis@@ assembled into individual sentences . the user can return punc@@ tu@@ ation or sales manner , repeat the output , pause or cancel the output .
for example , if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and whose sex is female , it will be used , otherwise the best matching speaker will be used . if you want to know more about how &amp; kt@@ ats ; select a speaker , you will see in it .
if you click Add to add a speaker to the list or click Edit , the board speaker facility will appear . as an example , the module for Festival Interactive is shown below . for details on the modules , see below .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to the festival is included in P@@ AT@@ H , you only have to enter festival .
select the encoding for text that is passed to the festival . for voices , which are &amp; kt@@ ts ; known , this setting is automatically done . generally , Western languages will use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , eastern languages like Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these slider controls you can adjust the volume , voice speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select some of the controls and this grey is displayed , the voice you choose doesn &apos;t allow these settings to be displayed .
some voices such as multi @-@ sy@@ n voices need to be loaded for several seconds due to their size . if you select this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of the K@@ TT@@ SD , so that ( with larger memory consumption ) the first set is synthes@@ ized faster .
if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet set up a speaker ( or forget to click App@@ ly ) .
if this check box is selected , the program window is indicated on the start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , only the symbol t@@ m@@ gr is visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window .
if this check box is selected and t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr does not work yet , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . this allows you to stop or otherwise control the reading .
here all orders are listed in the queue , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sentences and the currently edited set . the speaker ID corresponds to the ID column on the card board speaker .
using the buttons in this series , you can set a set of rules on the order selected in the list below - or go back . ( but not every order consists of several sentences ) .
by clicking on OK , all changes in the settings ( also on the other card boards ) are taken and t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is res@@ ized to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to see the program window again .
if the sound system &amp; arts is not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ code , click on the box audio . see also .
there are only text commands listed and managed . expendi@@ tures of screen readers , warnings and messages are not displayed . for more information on the message types of &amp; kt@@ ye ; find in .
select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , &amp; kt@@ s ; either compiled without support for the appropriate audio module or &amp; kt@@ ts ; cannot load the necessary libraries .
if G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ code is to be used for audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you must install at least one module . if you have selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here .
set the speaker speed here . 50@@ 1 ; % equivalent to about half and 200@@ sqm , about the double normal voice speed . to allow these settings to be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed .
click App@@ ly to apply the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ t ; system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you have to find out which device works with you . in doubt , choose Standard .
on this card card you can set up special actions that are always executed when the text order is interrupted from a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ots ; processes four types of voice records :
the output of Screen Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders . once the screen reader &apos;s output has been read , the retained jobs will be res@@ um@@ ed .
warnings have the next higher priority . this level is important messages such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved to hot . a warning lasts the output of messages and normal text . these orders will resume after reading the warning .
News have the next priority . a message breaks normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks messages . if you have just read a long text on a website , you can talk to &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless , someone who just enters the room .
if a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or output of a screen reader , the audio output will be inserted into the queue .
this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both the introduc@@ tory sound and the introduc@@ tory message are active , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory message .
the settings on this card are valid only for normal text orders . messages , warnings , and screen messages are not specific if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority .
to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; to read K@@ No@@ tify news , run kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and click No@@ ti@@ fications .
check this check box to disable the reading of &amp; k@@ de ; noti@@ fications . if this setting is not checked , the other settings are disabled and &amp; kt@@ at ; does not read al@@ erts .
if this setting is selected , noti@@ fications in which a sound is played is from &amp; kt@@ ye ; not read .
use these buttons to add or delete events from the list . when you click the Add button , a dialog appears in which you can select the application and event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message before , the &amp; conversation ; sent when someone in an I@@ RC message men@@ tions your nick@@ name .
all events for which nothing else is specified in the list are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ots ; ignored .
use this drop @-@ down box to specify what &amp; Desktop to do when an event occurs . you have the following choices :
if you have selected user defined text , enter the desired text . you can use the following wild@@ cards :
you can enter here the characteristics of the desired speaker . default chooses the speaker , which is shown on the list on the list of boxes as the top entry . see also .
note that there are three levels for events . if an action is specified for a certain event of a particular application , it will be executed . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application . as the last option , the action will be applied , which was specified under Standard ( all other events ) .
the Event All No@@ ti@@ fications for Application Standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this , you can set the noti@@ fications as follows :
use the Save button to save the settings for noti@@ fications to a file . use the Load button to load stored settings from a file . the loaded events will be merged with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except All No@@ tices will be deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to mark text for voice output . this standard contains trademarks for controlling voices , voice speed , volume , gender of voice and pitch .

you need to install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) since this is the standard , the festival is used in the output of SS@@ ML .
if settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100 , SS@@ ML is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ously .

there are two types of filters - normal filters and set @-@ limits recognition filters ( S@@ B@@ Ds ) sub@@ divide text into single phrases . this allows you to start faster with reading , since only the first sentence has to be synthes@@ ized , not the whole text order . thus , you can also jump or stop orders on the card card , even if the voice synthes@@ izer does not support this directly .
here you can see the Stat@@ utes Automatic filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ye ; a set @-@ border detection filter is set up as default . you can change its settings or add more set @-@ limits recognition filters , but beginners are advised .
the easiest way to learn about setting up the voice selection is by clicking on . switch on the selection of speakers and enter text for reading . check the list of speakers , change some properties and check how the speaker &apos;s selection changes . of course , you need to have more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ye ; then you can start reading faster , because only the first set has to be processed and not the whole text block , which can take a long time ,
you can then stop or cancel text jobs on the card card , even if the voice synthes@@ izer does not support this function .
for these reasons , the normal rate recognition filter is automatically set up when you start t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be turned off , only removed . do not change anything about this filter unless you know what you are doing .
pattern Rec@@ ogni@@ tion Fil@@ ters compare text with a regular expression for punc@@ tu@@ ation and insert a tab@@ ul@@ ator character ( decim@@ al code 8 ) at the set limits . note that the standard set limit filter preserves the punc@@ tu@@ ation .
S@@ BD filters will never be applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( k@@ notify ) , warnings , messages or the output of screen readers .
if you have removed the normal set @-@ up filter by mistake , you can insert it again by loading the contained file standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c .
the card reader option allows you to over@@ ride the speaker settings for the application . the card card is displayed when
use of the standard speaker ( the top of the card board speaker ) . in other words : no speaking characteristics are specified .
use of the most appropriate speaker that has all the characteristics of a set up speaker . if you do not delete or edit the settings of the speaker , select &amp; t@@ ts ; otherwise select &amp; t@@ ts ; the speaker that best matches the default settings .
select the method to enter the desired speaking properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
select here the properties of the desired speaker . if this property does not matter , enter nothing .
select this check box if the property should have priority over other properties . you can also set multiple flags here .
since language is a critical factor in understanding the output , it is always treated as a priority property . you will rarely use this property . the only case where you may want to specify the attribute vocabulary is before you know that a particular application sends text in another language than that in the work environment .
to use all the features in the field of speakers most likely to delete the following , click on the default speaker icon and then use the speaker that best matches the following .
in this case 0 stands for the last text order in the queue . you can also specify an order number . ( without order number , input 0 is required ) .
Oc@@ t@@ m@@ gr immediately crashes when it is started . I have compiled de@@ bug support , but I don &apos;t get back@@ trace .
G@@ Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x will probably have to register G@@ Stre@@ amer . if the problem is not solved , a non compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer may be installed . you can try to update or uninstall G@@ Stre@@ amer .
the audio output via AL@@ SA does not work when I play music at the same time with another application . if I receive a text order , freezes &amp; kt@@ h ; a . on the &amp; Con@@ sole ; appears a message that says : Un@@ able to open PC@@ M .
on your system , there is a problem that conflicts arise with AL@@ SA , which prevent simultaneous opening of several PC@@ M devices . for possible solutions , see the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org .
I have downloaded an additional voice for festival from the Internet . I have installed it and can use it in festival , but Oc@@ t@@ m@@ gr does not show this voice .
add the new voice in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / fes@@ tival@@ p@@ int@@ . as instructions . if this is successful , please send a patch together with the &amp; URL ; on which you have found the voice to the developers .
on the card card audio there is a setting speed . in order for this to work , the program must be so@@ x installed and can be found through the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H . some synthes@@ iz@@ ers like Festival Interactive offer a setting for speed on the card card for speaking devices . depending on the selected voice , this is active or in@@ active .
the settings for the chat speed are ignored when &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; read . ( this is because the HTML is turned into SS@@ ML . ) En@@ able either the filter for conversion from &amp; HTML ; ( see ) or if you are quite brave , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ by @-@ SS@@ ML res@@ hap@@ ing filter , and set the chat speed up .
I don &apos;t make it that websites are read with a female voice . I have arranged a female festival speaker but &amp; kt@@ ots ; read the web pages with a male voice .

I have added an own set of character set filters and now I can in &amp; kt@@ ops ; no more set @-@ on or go back . on the box @-@ jum@@ per orders are displayed , the job consists of only one set . what am I doing wrong ?
punc@@ tu@@ ation characters ( point , question marks , ex@@ clamation marks , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) are not allowed to filter out . instead , use a filter for mark detection .

some users experience conflicts with the audio output in connection with AL@@ SA . if your system is also part of it , you can &apos;t simultaneously play music and read a text . it also freezes when you pause a text order and then start another . possible solutions for this problem can be found on the website of AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) .

before using &amp; Desktop , check first if your voice synthes@@ izer is working properly . follow the instructions that you received with the synthes@@ izer .
Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers , whose source code is open . the quality of the voices is generally good , and multiple voices and languages are supported .
you need to install at least one language . help can be found in the instructions provided with the festival . if you want to read web pages , you need to install the ( male ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone .
for these voices you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions in passing on .
the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ zip the software in festival / li@@ b / vocals / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set up the Russian voices , you need to enter the voices MS@@ U _ ru _ NS@@ H _ di@@ phone . choose a Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) encoding , such as ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
the festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . therefore , choose Festival first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the encoding option on ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 must be set .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding option must be set to an 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic as for example ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival can be used together with the MB@@ RO@@ LA ; synthes@@ izer . then Festival takes over the lex@@ ical analysis and the MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates the audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ program and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; no complete voice output system is . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from Di@@ phone files . you need additional software to create this Di@@ phone . Festival generates this from &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; required di@@ phon@@ e.@@ t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also generate Di@@ phone from German lyrics . for more information see .
with this method additional wra@@ pper code is added to the festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ Vo@@ ices for speech synthesis . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voice files will not be installed in the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; folder but in the folder festival / li@@ b / . instructions can be found under
I@@ MS German Festival is a modified version of Festival for German &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; Vo@@ ices . required is either Festival version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first install Festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; then download MS German Festival from
instructions can be found in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file in the package that you downloaded . ( for use with Festival 2.0 , setting the bug fixes is not required , you only need to re@@ compile the festival ) . then add the following lines to the file festival / li@@ b / sit@@ ein@@ it@@ .@@ sc@@ m .

this hand@@ book explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center , which allows to manage network interfaces , routing and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a range of system and desktop settings via a unified , integrated interface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be accessed by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package is designed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the areas of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple interface for the user :
after installation , a new module network settings will be displayed at &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the network settings module ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be run through selection of k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network network settings in &amp; K@@ Menu ; started .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured in a fully functional way .
in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and set up during installation &amp; Linux . if network devices are added later , the drivers must be loaded by adapting the following files depending on the kernel version :
the network settings module will be loaded when the network settings option is selected at the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index . when starting the module network settings , this tries to automatically detect the platform used on the system .
if the platform cannot be detected , the manual selection is offered . it is the platform to choose from the list that best meets the distribution and release status . selecting the setting of non @-@ re @-@ poll@@ s can be permanently fixed . when the network settings are started , this selection will be automatically set .
changing the network settings is possible only in system administration mode . before , all options are gray , meaning the settings can only be viewed , changing is not possible . in the system administration mode , you can enter the system administration mode at the right bottom of the module . it is necessary to enter the password .
the entire functionality of the module is available in the system administration mode . it is divided into three tab@@ s :
the tab Network interfaces can be used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . from the tab Network interfaces , the following tasks can be performed :
the network interfaces displayed by default can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button interface ... in the dialog box can be edited .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the Advanced Settings button to show the dialog with further options .
the automatic mode uses TCP / IP settings from a DH@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings for the system are done at the same time with the start of the system services . the DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information for each system start , so no further setting is required . in the selection list , either DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , according to the system , can be selected .
with the option Manual can be done without dh@@ c@@ p or BO@@ O@@ TP the TCP / IP configuration . in the input field IP address the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . in the input field net@@ mask the sub@@ net mask must be specified .
if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface while bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be enabled .
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . the input of an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . ping in the &amp; Con@@ sole ; you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or turned off according to your needs . switching on an out@@ dated network device can be activated by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ....
network devices can be activated or turned off according to your needs . turn off an enabled network device by selecting from the list and click off the interface ...
specifies the IP address of the host in the local sub@@ net , which communic@@ ates the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with hosts in other sub@@ nets .
if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is located .
a computer with DNS support replaces a full domain specification through the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the host calls ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS solves this name in an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the name resolution calcul@@ ator is a simple management of this list . entries can be added , removed or changed . DNS records can be sorted by selecting an entry and up or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list with the Hin@@ di or Her@@ b buttons in the priority .
by clicking the button Add ... from the group machine to the name resolution , a DNS server can be added . it will be displayed the New Name Server dialog .
first you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry will be inserted in the list .
from the group machine to name resolution , select an entry and then click the Edit button .... it will display the Edit dialog .
the list of specifically known hosts describes the name @-@ to @-@ IP address links for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used when bo@@ oting when there are no DNS servers available . in small , enclosed networks , it can replace DNS server .
normally the list of specifically known hosts contains some entries that support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses . this still in the test version of IP is to replace version 4 in the future .
enter the IP address of the known machine and click Add .... the Add New alias dialog will be displayed .
enter the name of the known machine and click the Add button . if the known machine has multiple alias names , press the Add button repeatedly and enter the alias names .
select an entry of a name that is known by name from the list and select Edit .... editing your machine is displayed .
it can be performed one of the following tasks , then by clicking on OK the list of static hosts will be updated .
the settings made in the network settings are not immediately active in the system . in order to activate the changes , the following command must be set in a &amp; Con@@ sole .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
the installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) is sufficient if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the ready compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a &amp; Con@@ sole ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively , a tool with graphical user interface such as k@@ package or the installation tool of your distribution can be used .
in this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient , but additionally the development packages are needed with libraries and others .
this is recommended only to experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should do so .
in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology will be given . in the second section , all of the configuration files are discussed by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf .
this area cannot replace further knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x only basic information about the integration of the PC is provided in a small ( home ) network .
IP networks are currently operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never been widely used . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to continue in the near future . therefore , this description is currently focuss@@ ed on the widespread IP@@ v@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is the knowledge of the IP address of a network interface . in foreign networks , at the &amp; eg ; work@@ station , the network administrator is the contact point where a valid IP address matches or if available , DH@@ CP can be used . in any case , the IP address cannot be chosen arbitr@@ arily !
when setting up your own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a reserved area specifically for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet , so any use is possible .
of course , access to the internet can be enabled for such machines by setting a gateway .
for smaller networks , addresses in the range from 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 are usually used . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 so that all computers are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first one is the so @-@ called default route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own machine ) . the default route is required for IP forwarding .
the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . normally the address is assigned 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 of an own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface that works like a closed circle .
this section contains the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes changed dynamically in DSL links , so it will not be surprised if there is another content to be found there in the case of active DSL connections .
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; it is known that this file is acci@@ dentally sorted by the scripts in Su@@ S@@ Econ@@ fig . another stand than expected can therefore occur .

print the c@@ ron@@ tab of all users on the system . this option is only accessible to users who have advanced permissions .
cr@@ on , for example , Vi@@ x@@ ie cr@@ on . &amp; cr@@ on ; uses the c@@ ron@@ tab command to change the schedules of users .
a PO@@ SIX con@@ form@@ es &amp; UNIX , for example gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; cr@@ on ; uses standard commands from &amp; UNIX ; to learn time and date .
&amp; k@@ dat ; is a tape backup program based on tar . it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape . the first thing was to create a surface for tar , which additionally offered the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for quick , selective un@@ packing . the second goal was answering a question that my wife placed : how much longer does it take when you backup ?
before a tape can be used , it must be done by &amp; k@@ dat ; this can happen in three ways :
&amp; dat ; str@@ uts down the tape and reads the pre@@ tension@@ ing information of the tape . recognizes &amp; dat ; the pre@@ p on the tape does not , you will be asked if the tape is to be format@@ ted .
recognizes &amp; k@@ dat ; the preview , it searches for the right index on your disk . if this is not found , you will be asked if the index should be recre@@ ated .
if everything went smoothly , the icon will change for the tape drive to indicate that the tape was mounted . in the Status bar a corresponding message appears . the contents of the tape can now be searched by folding the entry for the tape .
before ej@@ ecting the tape , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this :
&amp; dat ; by changing the symbol for the tape to recognize that the integration for the tape has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the tape can now be ej@@ ected without danger .
before a tape can be used , it must be written by &amp; dat ; format@@ ted .
a strip type must be format@@ ted before you can be used to store data . this procedure does not correspond to the format@@ ting in &amp; k@@ dat ; this does not correspond to format@@ ting in &amp; k@@ dat ; it needs to be format@@ ted before use . floppy tape drives usually require format@@ ting of tape , but DA@@ T drives do not .
after entering the band name and capacity is going &amp; k@@ dat ; with the format@@ ting of the tape . all data on the tape is lost ! after completion of the format@@ ting process , the tape is automatically mounted and ready for use .
before you start the backup process , you must select the files to be secured . this can happen in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder will be backed up .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile will be backed up .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be backed up .
right @-@ click on the local file tree and select in the Save menu ...
once the backup has been started , the Settings dialog will open . in this dialog you can once again check the selected files and change the settings for backup .
the dialog will display the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . it will only check the selected file or folder .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a check . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be checked .
right @-@ click on one of the archives and select the item In@@ sert ...
once the check procedure has been started , the dialog for Review will appear . in this dialog you can check your selection once and change the working folder for the check .
if you have confirmed the settings for the check , the dialog appears . this dialog shows the progress of the audit process as well as the data throughput and the time remaining .
before you can initiate the restore , the files to be recovered must be marked . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives that are part of the tape drive . only the selected file or sub@@ folder will be recovered .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a check box . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be recovered .
right @-@ click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rest@@ ore ....
once the restore process has been started , the dialog window will appear for recovery . in this dialog you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for recovery .
once you have confirmed the restore settings , the dialog will be restored . this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the time remaining .
sometimes it turns out to be necessary to recre@@ ate the band index file using the band content . this procedure del@@ etes all existing index files for this tape . you can create the index on two types of tape :
this creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile :
the current working folder in which the backup should take place . the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the currently selected work folder .
for all folders listed under backup files , only the files in it that are located on the same fil@@ esystem , such as the folder . folders that are located on other fil@@ es@@ ystems can be stored separately under backup files . each entry is considered by tar independent from the others .
perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then are backed up .
the name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
delete the snapshot file before tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file will be created for the next backup .
the functionality of buttons files &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; lt ; files have not been fully implemented at the time of creation of this documentation yet .
you can set up the settings from the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can do the following settings :
the complete path to the device node for the tape drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must point to the non @-@ winding variant of the tape .
this setting is active , transmitted &amp; dat ; before the tape is mounted the command mt load to the drive . in some drives , this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed .
if the option is turned on , tries to lock the ej@@ ector from the tape drive . this setting may not work with all tape drives .
if the option is turned on , the mount will be dis@@ car@@ ded automatically . do not use this option for flo@@ pp@@ ies .
if the option is enabled , tries to change the hardware @-@ like block size for the tape drive . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter if this setting is active or not , you need to be &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case you need to share the block size for your tape drive .
if &amp; dat ; a tape is format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only occupy a memory block on the tape . the contents of the file are composed as follows :
( n Byte ) The volume of this string is the name : seconds , where host@@ name is the full name of the system on which the tape is format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the time in which the tape was format@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the file $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat / .
the rest of the files on the tape are tar archives , which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work unless they are incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the contents of a tape . this symbol is only active when a tape is mounted .
&amp; k@@ System@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Viewer for system logs . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system provides the various protocol files . in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log enables experienced users to quickly access information about problems that occur on their server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system leaves the various protocol files .
moreover , &amp; k@@ system@@ log enables experienced users to quickly access information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore tries to provide some advanced features that allow filtering and evaluation of the protocol files of certain programs .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; k@@ System@@ log ; a number of useful features . these include :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the sy@@ slo@@ g server and for sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included and will be explained in the chapters of this manual .
as you can see in the following screen@@ shots , make &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions available with which the individual protocol lines of a protocol file can easily be filtered and sorted . the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after the start , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first , the most important log file of the system - the system protocol - will open . instead it opens a small message window , so you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; very probably not started with system administrator privileges . normally , the log files are usually found in the / var / log folder for normal users usually do not have permission to read .
you can also use the filter bar to filter by a selected criteria or according to entered strings . the list of log messages is now automatically changed , so only log lines will be displayed . in the default setting a protocol row will only be displayed if the string of the filter keyword is contained in one of the columns .
you can also select another entry at this point . the string of the filter search term is then matched only with entries in the corresponding column . for example , in the Protocol file system log , select the name of a process , so show you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all log lines sent or created by this process .
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . protocol lines of the level error are indicated by a more con@@ spic@@ uous color than log lines of the level note . the color representation of protocol lines can be turned off setup dialog .
if you want to show only a specific process ( for example in the system protocol or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can hide the process identification ( PID ) in the process column . this may , for example , be useful if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the Sam@@ ba server . in this case , you can use filtering strips .
in addition , you can select the To Add New Lines option from the main window contex@@ tual menu to display all the new log rows added .
&amp; k@@ System@@ log ; allows to display multiple protocol files in separate sub@@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . as soon as you have selected a sub@@ window , select a sub@@ window in the menu .
&amp; k@@ System@@ log ; has its own web site on ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. You will find more information about the sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .
&amp; k@@ System@@ log ; also find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archive : k@@ system@@ log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Archive
welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and also called ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ;
the system V In@@ it is quickly becoming the standard for the control of the program start when the system starts up in the &amp; Linux world . it is because it is easier to use , more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD -@@ In@@ it .
I will not go further into historical aspects ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
the in@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is important because maybe someone might try to switch a machine on System V In@@ it without installing a re@@ installation and re @-@ format@@ ting . therefore , you must make sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there if there was one .
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it also differs from the BSD in@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c@@ .d@@ . D@@ ort you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folders :
init@@ .@@ d contains a lot of scripts . basically you need a script for each system service you want to run when you run the system , or when you switch to another level . system services do not include such things as set@@ serial , which is only started once . such calls are based on r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should be under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if there is not much use for it . you can also set up a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d , if you want to do something with the serial port .
the kernel looks like in@@ it at different locations and starts the first one to find .
the default Run@@ time is entered in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . you should see a line like the following in the starting area :
at this point you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the default runner is 3 . if you want to change that , then you can edit / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab from hand and change the 3 . if you have done something , then you can repair it by re@@ bo@@ oting the system and exec@@ uting the following :
but how does it start all the right scripts ? if you type ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no correct files in this folder . instead , each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the init@@ .@@ d directory .
how starts and stops in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop . you can actually start these scripts from hand on the command line as follows :
this would stop the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if it contains a K , the script will be inv@@ oked with the argument stop . if it contains an S , the script will be inv@@ oked with the start argument .
some people desire a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could have a server run@@ level running only ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc ; in addition , I could also have a user -@@ run@@ level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , Network &amp; etc ; starts .
here you learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or other poin@@ ter is simple to not tell tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the area of available system services to one of the six run@@ levels to start ( or stop it ) .
you can also move scripts between the level level or change the position within a level by drag@@ ging it somewhere else . this will only happen if you pull out an entry from the area of available system services .
note : entries are moved if you drag them into a new area . to copy them to a new run@@ way , you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert them into the target zone -- even if the same entry existed previously in the target zone of the action .
the sort number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you must edit the Sor@@ ti@@ ern@@ um@@ er@@ numbers of the surrounding entries before you can re @-@ attempt to insert the system service .
note : currently there is no way to restore records thrown into the recy@@ cle bin . be careful .
you can use the tab key to activate the various working areas ( Available system services , run@@ level 1 start , run@@ level 1 stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one .
to move an entry to another level , move it into the clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ trl ; X ) and paste it into the desired run@@ level with insert ( with C@@ trl ; V ) .
to manually change the sorting number or the name of an entry , press the button to open the Properties dialog . use the tab key to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all the entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . default settings are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise , they will be restored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I experim@@ ented with the standard run@@ levels , and now the machine is constantly re@@ started . what can I do ?
enter the LI@@ LO Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab and change the default running level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be OK ) .
I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; intended to run under running level X , but they are not executed .
if you are using &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Deli@@ x ( DL@@ D ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only present in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution .
the way system services are launched in these distri@@ butions , simpli@@ fies the configuration for the proprietary set @-@ up programs of these distri@@ butions but unfortunately does not meet any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you use another distribution : please check if all configuration files are available that are required by the respective system service ( and also if they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or ht@@ tp@@ d ) simply exit without notice if their configuration files are not present or wrong@@ ly set up .
the meaning of the GNU / Linux ; -@@ runtime varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use another distribution , please send me information about the runtime level so that it can be added to this manual .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user , it is sufficient to read the chapter custom@@ ization by &amp; k@@ user ; to read .
once you have made any changes , you will need to save them . either use the respective icon of the toolbar or the Save in the File menu .
the main window consists of two flash@@ cards , the user and the user group list . to edit , select the desired user or group by double @-@ clicking on the entry . it appears the user and group properties dialog .
some flash@@ cards are only displayed if you have advanced system settings . only if you have activated space restrictions ( quot@@ a ) for users , a card card will be created on which you can make individual settings . additional flash@@ cards appear , if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d like in BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes are installed .
the card password administration appears , if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed like in BSD Uni@@ xes .
this card only appears if for at least one built @-@ in fil@@ esystem space restriction ( quot@@ a ) is enabled and initi@@ alized ( recognizable by the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) . here , parameters can be changed for each user , whereby the space limitations are in KB :
these parameters can be set for each file system individually . the current fil@@ esystem is selected with the help of the field fil@@ esystem with space restriction .
the map groups inform about the group dependen@@ cies of the selected user . the standard group to which the user belongs , can be found in the Prim@@ ary group field . furthermore , the user can be a member in other groups by marking them in the large field .
the Properties of the group contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , mark that user in the list .
to add a user or group , select Add from the user or group menu or click the appropriate Add button on the toolbar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or group works analog .
with this module you can install the LI@@ LO boot@@ manager , add , remove and change boot password , change the time until bo@@ oting the default operating system , add the default operating system , remove , change operating systems , remove , change and more .
