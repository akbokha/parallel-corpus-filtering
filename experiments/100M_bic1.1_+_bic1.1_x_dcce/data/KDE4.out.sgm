<seg id="1">You will find the module website compile in the & konqueror; menu under Extras webpage. select the output and target language of the translation from the drop-down list.</seg>
<seg id="2">If a part of the text is selected, only this part will be translated at the place of the entire & URL.</seg>
<seg id="3">Machine translations are only very rudimentary. babelfish produces in the best case a rough translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore, you should not make any important decisions on the translations, without checking the translation beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only websites on the internet can be translated. other texts should be translated at the Babelfish page itself, where you can paste text into translated texts directly.</seg>
<seg id="5">The package includes various modules for & konqueror; despite their small size, they offer some additional features and simplify the use of some functions of & konqueror; by making them easier available.</seg>
<seg id="6">For more information on the use of & konqueror, and the built-in functions, consult & konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="7">To load these modules in the & konqueror, select configuration extensions... Open the map tools and select the desired modules there.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list of standard modules from the box kde; addons. please note that there may be more modules on your system if you have additional software installed.</seg>
<seg id="9">You should install the kdebase package, the & konqueror; contains before compiling this package.</seg>
<seg id="10">To use the crash module, click on the & konqueror; on Tools Degrees. then you can view the page that has brought & konqueror, or the list of crashes, if any, delete.</seg>
<seg id="11">The pagefilter module (also called folder filter) can be reached in the & konqueror; menu bar under Extras Angle Filter. with the module you can filter & konqueror; 's current working directory in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="12">To use the DOM tree view in the & konqueror, choose Extras DOM Tree... and open a new window with DOM of the currently displayed web page. as default, the document begins with the root node of the document, for example: documentary element, all other nodes are subelements of this root node.</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & konqueror; provides another view for objects with the MIME type inode / directory on local files. it can be used as an alternative to the different symbol and text views, in order to view the contents of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">The peculiarity of & FSView; is to display nested folder hierarchies using a Tree-Map. tree maps allow the representation of the size of objects in nested structures. each object is represented by a rectangle whose surface is proportional to its size. this size must possess the property that the sum of the size of the subordinate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">For & FSView, the size of a file or folder shows the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries in it. thus, large files can be easily recognized, even if it is located far down in the folder hierarchy. accordingly, & FSView can be seen as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX; -command you are viewing.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView; an entry in the Treemap display is a rectangle representing a file or folder in your file system. for easier navigation, the rectangles have meaningful color and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle that is switched between view color mode can either represent depth for the light detection of the nesting depth or the illustration of another file property such as name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder. for each property, you can specify whether or not it is displayed at all, only if there is enough space to display or whether the area should appear in the symbol of the Treemap. furthermore, you can specify the relative position of the lettering in the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">For Treemap in & FSView, this objective is not always maintained. frames are drawn to represent the nesting of the entries, and this setting requires space, which is no longer available to the subordinate entries. note that less space is lost for the frame when the rectangle is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">How to divide the area of an entry for the subordinate entries is left to the implementation. here it is always advantageous for inscription and avoidance of space losses through frame always to divide the areas so that rectangles are possible, which are as square as possible. the best methods in this regard are rows, columns or recursive branches.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can specify the minimum displayed area for an entry above the menu entry view on area. instead, a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinate entry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally it was & FSView; intended as a small test application and introduction to the use of the TreeMap widget developed for the KCachanlage application.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Picture Gallery can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Extras Image Gallery... or by Ctrl; I.</seg>
<seg id="24">When you access the Picture Gallery, a dialog opens, which allows you to specify the appearance of the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="25">The title of the page allows you to adjust the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field.</seg>

<seg id="35">In the check box Custom color depth, you can set a different color depth for the thumbnails as in the original pictures.</seg>
<seg id="36">The module & HTML; -Settings gives you easy access to the General & HTML; -Settings for & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="37">The module & HTML; -Settings can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Extras HTML settings. the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here:</seg>
<seg id="38">The Media Playback for the Navigation Pane can be found in the & konqueror; View menu under Windows Navigation Section or by keyboard shortcut F9.</seg>
<seg id="39">To play, click in the Navigation Pane of the & konqueror; and drag the music files you want to listen to in the media playback.</seg>
<seg id="40">Changing browser ID adds a menu entry in the & konqueror; in addition, with which you can change browser and operating system detection for individual domains. this is helpful for websites that allow access only with certain browsers.</seg>
<seg id="41">The default browser recognition of the & konqueror; is Mozilla / 5.0 (compatible; Konqueror / 3.3; Linux) (KHTML, like Gecko). if you come to a web site that refuses to access this browser, change browser recognition to one of the following options.</seg>
<seg id="42">Change the MSIE ID for pages that deny access to browsers based on mozilla. for example, you need MSIE browser recognition to use the & konqueror to call hotmail.</seg>

<seg id="55">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided for you to connect with your digital camera and download your photos directly in & digicam; albums can be downloaded by means of the library gPhoto2. of course, every medium and every card reader that is supported by your operating system will work with & digicam; work together.</seg>
<seg id="56">& digicam; contains a fast image processing with basic image editing tools. you can use it to view, comment, evaluate and correct your photos. the processing capabilities can be easily expanded with KDE Image plug-ins interface (manual) modules.</seg>
<seg id="57">Although & digikam; easy to use, it provides dozens of professional skills. it works completely in 16-bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion using libraw, DNG export and ICC color management workflow.</seg>
<seg id="58">Improved database with considerably more metadata such as & eg; through the camera or the lens to search for.</seg>
<seg id="59">Like all & kde; programs are also digitised; an open source project. that means it depends on the support of the end users. therefore, you should report problems and improvement opportunities.</seg>
<seg id="60">& digitised; tries to make the reporting of problems or suggestions as easy as possible for them. wherever you are in the program, the Help menu contains an entry problems or wishes. if you use this link, your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system. all required information is already entered here. just follow the instructions to send your report.</seg>
<seg id="61">& digitised; is a project supported by a community. if you are a regular user of & digicam; if you are a regular user of & digicam; then we would like to ask you to answer questions to other users of & digicam; however, in this mailing list English is spoken, you should therefore be powerful in this language.</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also visit the digicam; visit homepage to learn news about released versions and other information about & digicam; to learn.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to get to & digicam; to participate, registration is in the developer mailing list. instructions for notifying in the developer mailing list by & digikam;.</seg>
<seg id="64">When you start & digicam; for the first time, you will be asked where you want to save your images and your database. you can enter a local, remote or remote folder here. simply enter the path name or click the Folder icon Folder icon to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field, you will need to specify a local folder on your computer. here, the data storage will be stored. this path will remain the same for all image folders.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later you can add as many folders as you want. & digicam; it will additionally use as an albian library. setup digicode set up collections</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a picture collection on your hard drive, you can specify the top folder that contains images as the base folder. & digicam; looks at every subfolder as an album. no picture will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="68">& digitised; Durns recursively the library path in all its depth. you cannot exclude subfolders, unless it iste in hidden folders. you can do exceptional & digitized by inserting a dot in front of the subfolder name.</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder, you will notice that the albums in My AlbenList will not have any photos as symbols. you can change them by taking any photo from the album and using it on the folder icon.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you have configured the base folder, you can be edited in & digicam; set up your digital camera. then you should learn how to use My Albums and My keyword list to manage your photos in the albums.</seg>
<seg id="71">Raw file support: if you use the raw version of your camera, it can be digitized, possibly bypassing it. support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported shell cameras in the Help menu support.</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set up this and work with raw files is described in the Roh decoder settings and raw workflow sequences.</seg>
<seg id="73">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided for you to connect with your digital camera and download your photos directly in & digicam; albums can be downloaded by means of the library gPhoto2. of course, every medium and every card reader that is supported by your operating system will work with & digicam; work together.</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash; memory cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transmission. the camera then appears as a disk drive. the camera can also be accessed via Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives.</seg>
<seg id="75">& digicam; uses the gPhoto2 program to communicate with digital camera. gPhoto2 is a free, distributed software collection for digital cameras which has been developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need for additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial interface for communicating with the computer. since photos are generally large files and transmissions via serial port are slow, this connection is now outdated. & digicam; supports these cameras and performs the transmission of images using gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found at this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphoto2 has been created with libexif support to reliably read digital thumbnails. Exif support is needed by some libgphoto2 camera operators to read the preview images. if the Exif support is not present in libgPhoto2, you might not be able to see thumbnails or the generation could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things in & digicam; is how easy it is to extend its functionality by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI modules: the KDE Image plug-in interface Project (manual) is an approach to develop a common module structure for & digicam; to provide KPhotoAlbum, Shodmg and Gwenview. the aim is to provide the modules to all graphics programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate images in almost every way, as also a user can. their advantage is that it is significantly easier to add a function, by writing a small module, when the changes in & digikam; even perform.</seg>
<seg id="81">To simplify the window, you can either remove the page strips with & LMB; remove or switch to fullscreen mode with F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F.</seg>
<seg id="82">Drag and drop pictures works everywhere: you can take a picture in another part of the albian tree, above the horizontal dividing line or into another application window. the only limitation is that a picture can not be stored in keywords, data list or search.</seg>
<seg id="83">- a file type selection allows you to highlight the most common: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, Movies and Audio</seg>
<seg id="84">The text filter is only used for the fields displayed in the toolbar at the moment. thus filtering on the file name only works if the screen is also displayed. which fields are displayed can be configured in the AlbenSetup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="85">The view & quot; My Albenlistequot; provides an organized view of your photo albums. all photos that were edited by & digicam are stored in a single album tree. these albums can be sorted according to the folders in which they were recorded on the hard disk, after the name of their collection in the album properties or after the date on which the album was created first. the date can be changed in the characteristics of the album.</seg>
<seg id="86">If you have set up a scanner, you can also scan a photo directly into an album. just select Import Pictures from the album. you can also add a screenshot directly to an album.</seg>
<seg id="87">In order to copy or move an image from one album to another, you can move the photo with the mouse over the target album and drop it there. in the pop-up menu you have to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying. simply select all the photos and move them to the target album.</seg>
<seg id="88">An album contains a collection of photos and the album properties allow you to enter information about this collection. in order to access the album properties, you have to click with the right mouse button on the album and edit the album properties in the pop-up menu.</seg>
<seg id="89">Album collections: are a method to highlight your albums so that you can group together under a common name. the collection you set will be used to sort your photos, if you want to add or delete new collections by collection. if you want to add or delete new collections, you can do so in the collections for collections.</seg>
<seg id="90">The Album Date: used when you sort your albums by date with View albums Up date.</seg>
<seg id="91">The buttons elder, average, new: they set the date on that of the oldest, the newest picture or that of the average of the album. this will first attempt to calculate the average of images from their EXIF information. if this fails, the date of the last change of each file in this folder will be used instead.</seg>
<seg id="92">When you first recorded an album in & digicam; open, the first image in the album is selected as a symbol for the & quot; My Albenlistequot; this will help you to remember the photos in the album. sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="93">To select another photo as an album icon, click the image with the right mouse button and in the context menu & quot; When album preview wroth; select. additionally, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can only be included in a collection and collections cannot be nested.</seg>
<seg id="95">& digicam; supports the entry of keywords for individual photos in the My keyword list at the bottom left of the main window. album collections have a different effect. the collection always includes all photos of the album.</seg>
<seg id="96">The picture window will provide you with the main view of your photos. if you select an album, all the images in this album will be shown in the picture window. each photo is displayed in a preview, you can customize the size of these preview using the two magnifier buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="97">When you open an album the first time, you have to wait short while the thumbnails will be generated. this can be avoided by recreating all thumbnails from the Tools menu.</seg>
<seg id="98">Information on each image is displayed below the thumbnail. what information this is, you can change the digitised settings; set up the albums page and customize the range preview images according to your wishes.</seg>
<seg id="99">The thumbnails have help windows that appear. if you let the mouse-cursor take a moment over a picture. the help shows the most important features including all keywords of a photo. the screenshot above in the introduction to the main window shows such a help window.</seg>
<seg id="100">Photos are all about digitising; albums and keywords allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you. image Editing displays your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to them. you can choose any of the features that have been edited with & digitized. you can choose between viewing the images, a slideshow or editing the images.</seg>
<seg id="101">You can open the image processing with a photo by selecting either F4 Picture Edit... or selecting the context menu of the image with the right mouse button, and editing... you will find instructions on how to edit your photos. image Editing lets you view and edit your photos.</seg>
<seg id="102">It can happen that & digicam; the functionality you need is not available. you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the submenu of opening. for this, and how to customize it to your needs, if your program is not listed, you will find information in the & kde; manual.</seg>
<seg id="103">You should note that after editing, there may be problems with the metadata contained in the image after editing. some programs do not store this data when you save the changed image. thus, this information is lost from the EXIF- and IPTC data, such as orientation, aperture etc.</seg>
<seg id="104">& digicam; provides two options for turning. the simplest one is to click with the right mouse button on the preview and select rotation. in the sub-menu you can indicate the degree of rotation.</seg>
<seg id="105">To change the filename of a photo, right click on the preview and select F2 rename from the context menu. note that you retain the extension (.jpg, .tif, & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="106">If you delete a photo from & digicam; delete it, it will be moved in the garbage bins of & kde; move. F8 image delete or Del Falls you prefer to delete, you can use this by using Shift; Del.</seg>
<seg id="107">The View & quot; My Datumslipquot; organizes your photos based on the data. & digicam; uses either the EXIF date or, if it is not available, the date of last modification of the file.</seg>
<seg id="108">If you select a month from the list, all photos of this month will be displayed in the picture view. you can select days or weeks in the data sheet at the bottom of the calendar view, so that only the photos of the selected days will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="109">Keywords are provided with a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos. keywords are stickers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups. once a keyword has been assigned a photo, the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search.</seg>
<seg id="110">If a keyword is selected, all the photos marked with this keyword will be shown.</seg>
<seg id="111">Keywords can be sorted in a hierarchical tree. by doing this, you can logically organize your keywords. you can also fold parts of the tree & quot; My keyworlipiquot; so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for.</seg>
<seg id="112">The keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IPTC data fields of the image, at least for JPEG. you can also re-import your keywords in other programs.</seg>
<seg id="113">You can add new keywords by right-clicking either on & quot; My keyword or click on an existing keyword and then select New Cue. if you have clicked on an existing keyword, this keyword will be used for substituting this keyword.</seg>
<seg id="114">You can delete a keyword by clicking the keyword with the right mouse button and select Delete. if you delete a keyword, the photo itself will not be deleted. only the keyword will be removed from this photo.</seg>
<seg id="115">You can change the position of a keyword by dragging it to the desired position in the tree and drop it there. then a menu appears that gives you the option to postpone the keyword. a keyword can only be in the tree at a time.</seg>
<seg id="116">You can change the properties of a keyword by clicking it with the right mouse button and selecting the keywords in the context menu. you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree & quot; My keyword.</seg>
<seg id="117">To select another photo as an album icon, click the image with the right mouse button and select it as album preview. in addition, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="118">To use keywords, you must first add your photos with keywords. this can be done in two ways: as soon as you select the photos that you want to put with a keyword, you can drag them to the corresponding keyword in the tree & quot; My keyword quot; drag and drop them. alternatively, you can click with the right mouse button on the preview of the pictures and select from the context menu keyword.</seg>
<seg id="119">You can tag a photo with any number of keywords. the photo is displayed as soon as you select one of the keywords assigned to it. in this way, you can assign a keyword for each person on a photo, one for the place in which the photo was made, one for the event where it was made etc.</seg>
<seg id="120">Once you have provided a photo with keywords, this will be shown in the main window by previewing the image.</seg>
<seg id="121">You can remove a keyword in which you right click on the photo's context menu and select Remove from the menu menu. the menu only shows the keywords that have been assigned to the photo.</seg>
<seg id="122">The timeline view displays a time-dependent histogram of the number of images per time unit. a selection frame can be moved through this histogram. to select a timeframe you only have to click on the lower rectangle of the selection frame that displays the time unit. this will display all associated images in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the bottom field you can enter a title and save your selection. it will appear in the list below.</seg>
<seg id="124">Include all elements of the database: names, ratings, keywords, keywords, albums, collections, date stamps and in the future even more.</seg>
<seg id="125">When you click here, the filter will be deleted and all images will be displayed again. if the search has not found anything, then the lamp will be red.</seg>
<seg id="126">The more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left sidebar with binoculars. if you open this you get a simple search box as described above. you can save this search here as a live search, which always filtered out what you entered as search criterion. after you have saved it, it appears in the list.</seg>
<seg id="127">When you are satisfied with your selection, press the OK button and the search will be performed. the text box Save As is used to add a name to my search list to your request. if you want to change your selection once again, you only need to select the appropriate entry from the View My Search list and select an option in its context menu.</seg>
<seg id="128">If you select to edit searches the form will appear again with the search information previously entered. if you choose to edit as advanced search, the dialog will appear for the advanced search to change your previous search. you will find more information in the section The Advanced Search Tool.</seg>
<seg id="129">If you want to delete an existing search from the list, select Clear in the pop-up menu.</seg>

<seg id="131">The list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the albian database. any option can be added to the search group / added by operators. each option can be added with other search group / search group. additionally, you can link search of type & quot; AND NICHTquot;.</seg>
<seg id="132">& digitised; characterized by a long number with a special technique, the hair algorithm. it allows to compare images by comparing these signatures. the smaller the difference between two signatures, the more they correspond. this technique is applied in three areas.</seg>
<seg id="133">Similar entries: this is an area where you can drop every picture to find a similar one. by using a swellings, the result selection can be enlarged or reduced. if you push a picture from somewhere over the symbol of inaccurate search in the left sidebar then it will open and you can drop it there.</seg>
<seg id="134">Sketch: hand-handed colour sketch: draw a quick sketch and & digicam; find the right pictures. also here can be set a threshold.</seg>
<seg id="135">This tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Marble mini program. you can move in or out or hold it on the mouse wheel. press Ctrl; left mouse button to move around a square. all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed. of course, this assumes your images contain Geo data.</seg>
<seg id="136">In the bottom field, you can specify a name for your geo filter, which will then be added for later use of the list below. it works like a Live Geofile.</seg>
<seg id="137">& digicam; provides a light table in a separate window with which you can easily compare images. it works with all supported image file formats, also raw files, together.</seg>
<seg id="138">Select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use Ctrl; L Dem Lightable added from the context menu. the selection will be added to the illuminated table and its window opened. if you are back in & digicam; main window, you can quickly open the illuminated table with L Extras illuminated.</seg>
<seg id="139">From the preview window you can drag the images you want to compare in the left or right pane of the window and drop them there. a small arrow shows you which copy in which window area is to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="140">Another mode is better suited to quickly sort out from a series of images. if you use combination mode to navigate from the toolbar, then the two first images will automatically be loaded into the same area. the right-hand side image will be displayed in the right pane. this simplifies it through a series of similar images.</seg>
<seg id="141">Of course, the normal deletion operations also work directly from the light table such as F4 file editing....</seg>
<seg id="142">All image information from the right side bar of the main window is available for both thumbnails in the light table. for example, this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data.</seg>
<seg id="143">At the bottom of each area you will find a built-in tilting function, which you can see on the crossed arrows. to pivot the visible area of the image, you need to click them and hold the & LMB; hold down. in the preview mode, both images will display the same image area.</seg>
<seg id="144">Just use the zoom slider under the images or Ctrl; scroll wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out. this happens in both images when you preview in the preview mode.</seg>
<seg id="145">What is a digital stock management - away from the fashion word? digital stock management considers every part of the process followed after the image has been taken up to final output and permanent storage. each of the photos records, scans or digital photos saves a form of digital stock management. however, most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="146">We give you a tool, a plan and practical tips how to back up, find, protect and reuse photos. we will focus on the procedures for digital photographers that & digikam; we will focus on downloading, renaming, converting, grouping, backing, sorting, sorting, waiting and exporting image files.</seg>
<seg id="147">& quot; Digital Stock Manager records, indexed, categorized, secures, searches, compiles, compiles and exports content that has a monetary or cultural value. quot;</seg>
<seg id="148">Metadata is defined as data about data. metadata is data, according to your definition, to provide information about or documentation of other data that are administered by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">If you don't even know how many photos you have, then you definitely don't use & digicam;. the approach to store metadata in both a database and in the image files guarantees very fast searches and secure archiving that you can freely access with other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate something into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure. your image files must somehow be organized on your computer. you must decide if you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive & etc; make sure you have to switch to a larger drive.</seg>
<seg id="151">You might be happy with this structure. vacation pictures can quickly be found on your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place. if you make enough photos, then you will use subfolders such as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc; then export is a folder for images you print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements, such as versioning of photos, archiving, work sequences, constant supply of images to different themes and a large number of everything. within 10 years 95% archives and 5% work files will have and you will then not want to reorganize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier. disconnect old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derivative image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend storing metadata in the editing page of the metadata in & digicam; this ensures that EXIF- and IPTC data are written to the file. if you forget this, you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the appropriate item in the Album.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what if you want to change which? added & digicam; they provide them with a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Of course you can select all the images that need the same attribute and set the value then. you start best with the rating or ranking. this makes sense as you can focus on the best photos at work.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let us now with keywords, keywords, such as you are often called by other programs, or continue categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">When you import catalogued images from another source with embedded keywords, it is edited and digitized; automatically build the tree for you or to do it by dragging one sub-tree to another. the changed keywords will be edited by & digicam; updated as it tracks the subtrees.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graph shows how different metadata overlaps. this is a very rough representation since each block of metadata consists of many sections. file names and calendar data are properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords - the next section refers to labels or comments, the third important tool to catalog your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You don't want to share your photos with your friends, your family, other photographers and agencies. you're sure to be interested in how your photos arrive.</seg>
<seg id="163">Look at this panorama. from a distance there is not even a nice panorama of the beach. if you look at it closer you start to see some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I say to you that this is the landing site of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in French Normandie 60 years after landing. wow! you start dreaming, having associations, memories, the historical period is again present, you may even hear the silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others who consider your photos, the title might be more important than the image itself to create an interest. if you show pictures you should tell a story. remember, the key is to transfer the importance to the viewer, to help him understand the motive that moved you to understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a labeling for itself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digicam; you can set any amount of text, in an internationalized alphabet (UTF-8), as lettering. you can even set it for a selection of images at the same time. KDE even provides you with a spell checking system.</seg>
<seg id="168">Do you remember the time before GPS? when you had to find another city without a navigation system? was it not a tedious planet in front of GoogleEarth? well, because with pictures the train of spatial presentation is already using light speed.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities of utilizing geolocation are countless and will become even more profound in the future. I am sure that one day, in the near future, you can virtually repeat your travels using pictures with geographic information.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a word game with copyright and denotes the practice to use the copyrights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies. the same freedoms also apply in all changed versions, so also for the works of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you what information should be stored in the setup page of & digicam; as information it should be stored:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for creator and author): this field should include your name, or the name of the person who created the photo. if it is not desired to protect the name of the photographer, then the name of a company or organization may be used.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author's title (synonym for author-line): associated with the author. this field contains the photographer's job description. examples of this can be titles such as: employee photographer, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer.</seg>
<seg id="174">Editor (synonym for vendors): use the provider field to identify who works the photo. if the photographer works for a news agency like Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations can be listed here, which offers the image to others. if the image is a stock photo, then the group / agency that offers the image here is given here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright passages even though they do not provide protection against misuse. anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with computers can delete or modify them in the image. for private persons, this is very important for most of your photos. for professionals and semi-professionals this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">Digital watermark is unique per image. & digicam; in the near future such a module will be available for batch processing.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: disk failure, record loss, surge protection, ECC, transmission errors, aging of storage media, recovery, redundancy, disaster prevention, life time, temperature, data size, spread superstition</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we don't talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or a fire. this kind of loss is the same that can happen to you in traditional paper photographs or negatives.</seg>
<seg id="179">Bankroll onTRACK, the world's largest data recovery company, has some interesting statistics which causes data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">To combat the problem with CDs / DVDs, these must be treated cautiously and you can no longer buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which last longer, harder to get and much more expensive. there are offers about gold coated DVDs, & dollar; 2 this piece which requires a lifetime of 100 years. whether you believe it is in your discretion.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD discs can be unreadable but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and sound recording devices and store them in the right way. the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write a lot more reliable.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to errors even if you have just written. therefore, they use a control box mechanism to protect yourself. however, 75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and checksums. despite this massive protection, they age by chemical ageing, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc.</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs, there is a convenient program called IsoBuster that apparently works miracles in CDs and DVDs. it runs under Windows and & Linux; but is still not available for Macs. there are similar applications to read damaged data from damaged disks, hard disks, flash drives, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray Disks seem to capture the format war against HD DVD. a dual layer Blu-ray disc can save 50 GB, and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8.5 GB. all that has been said to CDs and DVDs is of course also valid for the Blu-ray disc.</seg>
<seg id="185">Record the media with a description, date & author and then store it on a clean, dark, dry and protected spot. do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that this media can read.</seg>
<seg id="186">Diskmanufacturers retain your statistics for themselves. their manufacturers' warranties include a new disk but not the data. Google provides a large field study on the fault mechanisms of hard drives: disk failure report</seg>
<seg id="187">Brevity is the most common error cause, SMART is the most common error cause, SMART cannot detect this error. some errors identified by SMART indicate the imminent failure. this is especially reading errors and publishing counts. the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is the complete loss due to overvoltage. of course you can also recover data loss due to a power failure before you have saved the files, but these losses can usually be recovered without major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electrical devices don't matter much, it looks different in devices with computer chips and high-speed processors. these can cause serious damage. on your computer these anomalies can cause locked keyboards, complete data loss, hardware switch, destroyed motherboard and other defects. thus protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most common protection against spikes is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs part of the energy heat and grounded the rest. it is usually available in the form of a connector bar. however, remember that not every connector bar also contains an overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, you should ensure that it meets the UL 1449 standard, which guarantees a certain minimum of protection.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since an overvoltage of each cable can be used to your computer, you should ensure that also all peripheral devices connected to your system are protected. some manufacturers also provide overvoltage protection which also includes a telephone connection for your modem. others provide connection options for the coaxial cable of the cable modem and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are specially developed for notebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem.</seg>
<seg id="194">While an overvoltage protection system protects your system against minor fluctuations in the power lines it will not really help you with a complete failure. even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore make sense to invest in an uninterrupted power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to protecting against overvoltages, these devices can automatically supply battery power when a power outage occurs. some models allow them to continue to work until the current runs. if you buy an UPS, you should be sure they meet the same quality requirements as an overvoltage protection. in addition, the lifetime of the battery and the supplied software is of interest.</seg>
<seg id="196">Consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare its security with electricity disruptions with the costs to avoid this. a high quality overvoltage protection can get you for less than & euro; 40. this is only a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected with it. at the end, you should always remember all the cables before you go on holiday.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon web service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration you can use it as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software.</seg>
<seg id="198">You are, however, very expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB cost & dollars; 75 per year and 400 GB costs & dollars; 500. in addition, you have to send the data about the comparatively slow Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to a local data loss of the most important images. it is not a bad solution, but it is not a general securing solution.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com provide online storage services that are available on photos. your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the perspective of data backup, the web solutions are very secure. transmission errors are automatically cleaned thanks to the TCP protocol and the large companies offer a backup and a distributed memory.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain on the computer. all transmissions are susceptible to transmission errors. the ZFS and btrfs file system ensure at least the data integrity between the operating system and the hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="203">All these disturbances remain undetected until you open a photo and this is destroyed to your surprise. no one seems to have ever thought about it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much secure data route than that in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission loss, since they generate interferences within the data streams. in normal file systems, these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are currently not particularly affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. already in 2010 you will see thousands of errors annually.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS von Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle disk errors at a low level and are highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under a license for Solaris and Leopard under a GPL incompatible license.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle launched its own initiative with its btrfs file system. it is still in alpha state. it uses the same protection mechanisms that ZFS uses and is also available for & Linux; however, it is not yet part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of data loss in the notebook and 46% of the workstation systems.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think. it causes less damage than thefts or new installations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; hasn't been seen for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less susceptible to data loss than proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to name the most common file systems. you can find a very good English article here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupted data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the investigation process is higher and an undefined status is avoided. however, if a file was not completely saved before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the biggest threat to digital data: wrong, theft and human error are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors from digital cameras are 1-2 aperture sets from fundamental physical limits. it is meant that while the technology continues to develop there is a natural limit for this progress. sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result more worsening. a sensor size of 6 megapixels and a high-quality optics are the optimum for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 megapixels. for higher resolutions, you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">You get a 750GB hard drive today for 100 & euro; so do not blame anyone else for data loss. thus, 6% of all PCs are affected by a data loss each year. therefore, backup your data after a plan and test this backup before you make any dangerous as the reinstallation of your operating system, the replacement of disks or the resizing of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your backups every day on an external SATA drive. if, then one day, a lightning strike you are lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster strikes locally and destroys a lot. don't forget an airplane gap: fire, water, electricity, children and thefts are dangerous enough for your data. they usually affect a whole room or the entire house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, disaster prevention always means not local storage. bring your fuses up the stairs, into the neighboring house, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as mentioned above is a common reason for data loss despite fuse. if you have a backup which is not immediately available, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files to be backed up. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential protection: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup. generates a complete snapshot of two time points: the complete backup and the last differential protection.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: backup of files that have been changed since the last backup. create multiple snapshots. you can restore the original status at any time on which such backup has been made. this backup comes closest to an exception that is only scanned and not running.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines. unlike script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts, rsync only copies the difference of the files that were really changed.</seg>
<seg id="224">Backup important images directly after saving them on your computer to a DVD or other optical media.</seg>
<seg id="225">This procedure allows you enough time to detect and restore losses. at the same time you come for backup but with & lt; 130% of the size of working files. at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, IPTC stored in the image file, associated XMP files, preserving original, memory, scalability, media, retrieving images and metadata, copying images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, viewing devices,..., usage of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">To enable valuable images to survive the next 40 years, that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">Since the future is unpredictable due to your nature, you must consider all that is said today with caution and re-evaluate while time passes. unfortunately, you should ask yourself how the current system is backwards compatible. the less variations you have used in the past, the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should be answered by the explanations in this document. use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is available for everyone today. so if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures, keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the advice is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, storage and backup technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer default. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the technical expression for the possibility to change a system in its size. this actually means increasing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume you have scaled the scalability and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition. on * nix systems like & Linux; you can copy this area and transfer it to a new disk:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmesg whether your new record has been detected by the system, but don't hang it.</seg>
<seg id="235">/ dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdc & dollar; Parted resize / dev / sdc # works with ext2.3, FAT16, 32 and reiserfs & dollar; resize2fs / dev / sadc1 # modifies the size of the disk if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification. even if one day there is no software that can read it, you can create it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that slowly disappears from the market. therefore, you should not use it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="238">It is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16-bit per color channel and full transparency. the disadvantage is that it requires relative many administrative information, but not as many as TIFF and has a slow compression.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as image format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with a lossless compression algorithm (Deflate). however, a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people. therefore, there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG is a royalty-free and open image format designed by Adobe Systems. DNG has been developed on the basis of the need to unify the camera ear formats. it is based on the TIFF / EP format and required to use metadata. a handful of camera manufacturers already provide DNG and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon will use it sometime.</seg>
<seg id="241">This is possibly one of the reasons why, in 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML based XMP technology to replace & quot; Extensible Metadata Platforms;, a mixture of XML and RDF. it is a coding technology that allows users to embed their data into a file itself.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer to archive an original of your recording, mostly in raw format. XMP is suitable for storing the metadata separately from the image file. however, it can cause problems when linking between the metadata file and the image file, and as mentioned above, you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and place everything there.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models. the activities of DCMI are part of the DCMI communities and the DCMI workgroups, annual conferences and workshops, standard links and enlightening efforts to achieve widespread acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import pictures from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long as the pictures are on the camera edits, you can use it as a temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them to your raw archive. this feature is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a fine editing you can use external programs. if you edit the images again with & digicam; edit, then you should add the metadata again.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the edited images for copyright with a digital watermark. then export them to web galleries, code into mpeg, use in contact sheets, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digicam; to get. in the Adding a Photo to an album you can add a description of how you can add photos that you already have on your hard drive. however, the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for importing images to your Alb database.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digicam; to use, connect these to the computer, switch the camera to display mode and switch it on. another description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, it tries to connect with your camera. if the connection is made, a Fertig indicator appears at the bottom and the thumbnails of all photos on the camera are displayed. if this is the case, the filenames and a symbol for the file allocation for each file, photos, movies, music etc. are displayed on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information for each entry. with the features and metadata from the camera interface you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog displays file properties and the photo information that is internally stored by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer. note that some digital cameras don't have all the information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The Metadata tab displays the internal metadata such as Exif, manufacturer notice, GPS, etc. of the image. this information is the same as with the metadata page strip from the main window of & digicam; or image processing. note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The simplest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the download button and then download the selection of all. this loads all photos from their camera to a single album in & digicam;. when downloading, the photos are not deleted and we recommend you check if the pictures were safely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you do not want to download all the photos, you can select only the desired one with the default selection methods of & kde; once you have selected the photos, use the download button and then download the selected one.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, an option New is available. these images have not been edited by & digicam until now; in this case the new pictures are marked with a star in the preview window. if you choose this option, of course only the new pictures will be downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you are using the Select All or download Selected button, a dialog will appear where you can select the target album in which the photos are stored. you can see the list of existing albums in the My Albums tab. then select the folder from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After selecting the target album, press OK, and & digicam; loads the photos from the camera into the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete all of them at once by deleting the Delete button. if you want to delete only some, you need to select them first and then delete the selected delete.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there is no way to recover photos that you have deleted from the camera. so you should carefully check if the photos have been successfully downloaded from the camera. if you want to delete the camera, you should do so via the camera bed, as this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">The filenames are normally used again after the photos have been deleted from the camera. this can lead to duplicate file names, if you load photos from different recording studios into the same Album. therefore, it may be useful to integrate the date and time the image has been taken into the file name.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section, you will find options for rotating and mirroring the image and for date-based sub-albums. if you use this latter option, a folder is automatically created per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options During the transfer opens three more options that will be performed before the photos are stored on the disk. when selecting this, the corresponding entries will be copied from the Exif information to the IPTC fields. with the last option, you can correct date & time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">For example, if you wish to use another format as the default format, you can use the prefix to add the prefix to% Y% H:% H:% S in the editing field. turn on the date & time option. for more adjustments, you should read the help of the strftime command.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the option camera filename, you have the option to change the file names in lowercase when you download it. or in uppercase if you prefer.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new file name, the & digicam; used for a photo, is displayed below the name that the camera provides in preview. your settings to rename are stored and automatically used when you next open the camera window.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digitised; can use all information about the orientation of the camera to the time point of recording to perform an automatic rotation during shutdown. not all cameras provide this information. in the Metadata section, you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic turn is usually on, and if your camera doesn't deliver this information, it can be digitized; the photo is in its original orientation. if you want to turn off the automatic turn, use the Advanced button and select the Automatic rotation at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera provides information about the date the photo was made available, it can be digitized; use this to automatically create sub-albums in the target album when downloading. all images with the same date are uploaded into the same subalbum. not all cameras provide this information. in the section of the meta data you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is usually turned off, and in this case it stores & digicam; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this, you need to switch this option. use the Advanced tab and select the date-based sub-albums at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The simplest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the download button. then select Upload. the file selection dialog & kde; appears where you can select the files you want to upload. you can also select more than one file with the default & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done, it asks & digicam; you, where the images should be uploaded. a folder selector dialog for the camera appears. select the desired folder here and click OK to start the upload. images will not be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a generic term in this document. this refers to a position that is indicated in Longitude and latitude and can be displayed on a map. the data can be determined by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European GALILEO or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link an image with a precise geographical location. not everyone uses an airplane to map an area by automatic recording of GPS data. environmental planner, military, police, architecture offices and real estate agents can use this capability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you later forgot where exactly the photo was made, you can open a browser that indicates the area. if you want to send a postcard to another & digicam; user who wants to locate the location of the photo thus, or just want to document this aspect, it is good to store the position data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is, how do the GPS data get into the picture? first, you should know that exiv2 supports many GPS data fields, such as direction, semitrailers and map references. there are at least three ways to achieve this. directly with the right hardware, via post-processing of the GPS data and image files with the KIPI module for geographic mapping (manual) and finally via manual input of known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit. but there are a few working together with GPS receivers. either as card module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR rioh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from a device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel. however, you have to save this data in the GPX format as this is the only format supported by the module for geographic mapping.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are different programs for & Windows; and Mac OS that can extract and correlate the data of images and from GPS. on the following page you can do the same under & Linux; make gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know longitude and latitude or other data, then you can use this script that works with the Exuifconfig by Phil Harvey. it uses the signatures most hairy co-ordinates, such as maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com does not show European road maps. here are some European sites, at least in French, German and Spanish, which show all navigation details for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">& digitised; tries to give you so much control over his work processes as possible. there are many settings that changed the behavior of & digicam; to access these settings, you need to choose in the Options menu; you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left side.</seg>
<seg id="284">Select Action can display on Embedded Preview or start image editing. so you specify the default behavior of & digicam; fix if you click on an entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the standardization and copyright data. these data are automatically written to the corresponding IPTC data fields when the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface.</seg>
<seg id="286">Author title is a synonym for author-line: this field should contain the professional title of the photographer. this can be designations such as employed photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. as this is a more detailed description of the car field, this must also be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Editor is a synonym for vendors: use this field to specify the image that the photo offers. this does not have to be the author, if it works for a news agency, such as Reuters or Associated Press, then the group or agency that provides the picture should be listed here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC actions store the data in the corresponding IPTC field. this means that the metadata is permanently included in the image and not only in the digicam database; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be edited in & digicam; imported without getting lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Image labels as embedded captions (JFIF) in JPEG images: this synchronizes the comments you add to your photos with the labeling embedded in the images. this allows your captions to be read by other image viewers.</seg>
<seg id="290">The Settings page contains all the options for the information that appears when the cursor is in the main window over a file. depending on the selected option, this information is displayed or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; digicam; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats. to indicate which file types & digicam; view, you can add and remove the file extensions of this list. any file in one & digicam; album folders that does not have any of these extensions will be edited by & digicam; ignored.</seg>
<seg id="292">You can reset the default settings by pressing the Refresh button on the right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The settings of the brightness of & digicam; can be set to the default values on this page. however, whenever you open the illuminated table, these settings are turned on if possible. however, some images have different sizes and the synchrone mode is then not available. if you have one, then you can obtain better viewing results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, image editing uses a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select them here. you can turn off the toolbar if you use image editing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and underexposed areas of an image can be marked with darker or bright color in the picture. these colors are specified here. in image processing, this picture mode can be switched on and off with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma-subsampling, it is meant that the images are encoded in a higher resolution of luminance than in color information. please read this article in Wikipedia for more information.</seg>
<seg id="297">With the PNG compression option, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce the image quality, since PNG is used by a lossless algorithm. if you have a fast calculator, you can set this value to a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the option TIFF Compression you can compress the flate compression algorithm for TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. it does not affect the image quality because the flate algorithm works lossless.</seg>
<seg id="299">Even if you select the lossy setup, the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than normal JPEG. when this paragraph has been written, metadata hasn't been supported yet, but was in the planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In previous versions of & digicam, image editing was only one image viewer for photos. currently, it quickly becomes a tool for manipulating your photos. with this dialog you can change the image editing settings.</seg>
<seg id="301">The standard assumption is that all green pixels are the same. if the red pixels of the CCD sensor react more sensitive to ultraviolet light than the pixels with odd lines, this difference causes a grid pattern in output. if you use this option, solve this problem with a minimal loss of details. this option draws the picture a little soft, but eliminates the 2x2 grid pattern with the VNG- or AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white balance of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the automatic color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used when white balance is not set. standard is a fixed colour balance based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that underexposed images will get more details in the shutter lights in four steps. for other cameras, this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is it the top lights, so the parts of your images that are burned into the settings, due to the inability of your camera to look at the pointed lights. the setting colors triggers some unusual results, since it shows the pointed lights in various roses. finally, you can try to reconstruct some parts of the missing information from the pointed lights.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible since blue pixels generally do not saturate as quickly as green and red. & digicam; and dcrap therefore try to reconstruct the missing green and red portions from the still not saturated blue pixels. of course, this is a question of how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">When you select the Reconstructed option, you get the possibility to set a level. here, a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be individually adapted for each picture.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the Luminance value to your taste. you probably need to set it slightly higher than the standard 1. however, this can also be done later in the digital & digicam image options. to keep the time for the Demosaicing, you should proceed conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A Demosaicing algorithm is a digital image processing algorithm to calculate a complete image from the particle data that many cameras have and which provides a matrix of colored pixels. this algorithm is also known as CFA interpolation or color construction.</seg>
<seg id="310">And Dcraw provides three alternatives: bilinear, VNG Interpolation and AHD Interpolation. after some tests it looks like this. VNG Interpolation (variable number of gradients) was the first algorithm used by Dcraw. it produces color artefacts on the edges. bilinear is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable result.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color deviation of your lenses, you can set red and blue correcting values here. this is certainly the best method for graft correction, as you are done during the shell conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates color information and gives instructions how to be given back. LCMS and digicam also exist; information such as colour information can be translated from one colour space to the other, so that the colors are as accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior If an image is opened in image processing / Color management module with raw files start.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color Profile Set Folder the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC, where you can store all your profiles.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of the ICC-Profiles You have here the option & quot; Default; for your profiles to be stored. everything can be changed when opening the raw file later.</seg>
<seg id="316">The color management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here are only your pictures color managed not the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should fit to the camera manufacturer and model you use. not all profiles are created in the same way. there are some, such as Canon, which do not contain any color tweaking or gamma correction. currently, dcraw Gamma is not correcting for conversions at 16 bit depth. this means you have to perform the color mapping yourself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options such as the Soft Proof Profile, which allows you to emulate how your image would be returned from a device. this is very useful before you print image as your printer has a smaller color area than your camera and some colors therefore can work very saturated. this could be corrected manually instead of getting on the flashing algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras, it's quite obvious what color profile is intended for them. unfortunately not with the models from Canon. therefore, here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together.</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile extension makes it possible to recognize the style for the target: F for an exact style, L for landscapes, N for neutral, p for portrait and S for standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; image plugin interface. it is an interface supported by a range of & kde; image viewer and image processing. by providing this interface, & digicam; many modules supported to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has the KIPI modules installed, you will see a list of available modules. select the ones you want to use, and these are then added by & digicam; these modules will appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition you will find some also in the context menu of the preview.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings Shortcuts.</seg>
<seg id="324">More information about KIPI modules can be obtained from the KIPI project under http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The settings of the slide show should be easy to understand. the upper knob adjusts the time between the image transitions, usually 4-5 seconds. the other check boxes switch the metadata, respectively, which are displayed at the bottom of the images during the ad.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera properties show on the left side a list of all supported cameras. on the right-hand side there is a button automatic detection, which tries to identify a camera that is connected to the computer. if you want to use this, make sure that the camera is properly connected, switched on and in the image display mode. currently, here are serial, USB and USB / FireWire bulk storage supported.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom end you can set the path for USB- and FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage cameras. this field is only active if you have selected a USB or FireWire mass storage camera from the camera list. you must specify the path, / mnt / camera or / mnt / Removable, on which you attach your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & digicam; to use, you need to connect the camera to your computer, place it in the display mode and switch it on.</seg>
<seg id="329">Check if & digitised; the camera automatically detects. if not, you can set camera models and port manually. after you have set up your camera, your camera will appear in the camera.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera. it is displayed in the camera's main window. if you have more than one camera, you can insert all of them here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the option Consolidation dialog for moving pictures into the garbage can show you the interlocator of & digicam; when deleting a photo in an album, you can find more details when deleting a photo and deleting an album.</seg>
<seg id="332">Editorial changes through the right sidebar can be tacitly edited by & digikam; if you use the option to apply changes to the right sidebar without queries. otherwise, you will have to save the changes with the button Changes.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also display the welcome screen of & digicam; stop when starting. this will speed up the start-up of & digicam under certain circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="334">Setting Start after new photos requires & digicam; to search the basic folder after new or deleted albums / photos. this extends the start time of & digicam; if something is deleted from the base folder, it asks & digicam; it asks if it should delete it from the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Different color schemes can be edited in & digicam; used to customize the main window to your taste. these settings can be selected under Settings design from the toolbar. a preview of the available designs is listed below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs have been defined in plain text files. if you are interested in creating a new design for and digitized, you will find more information about this in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& digicam; contains a fast image editing with some basic tools. you can use it to view and correct your photos. editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or through the context menu of the preview and selection of the item View / Edit.</seg>
<seg id="338">Image Editing includes a set of tools to improve your pictures. some of them may be digitized as modules. so you may not be part of your distribution. for more information on the KIPI modules, see Setting Image Processing section.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status line at the bottom of the window displaying the filename, current filename, magnifying factor and the current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top and among them the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently needed functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing features of the image processing change your photos. however, none of the features will change the original photo before using the Save or button Save button from the toolbar. note that you can no longer restore the original photo once you have saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">You may want to make a copy of your image before you change it. this can be done with file Save as executing.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by using the Restore button from the File menu or the button Restore the image processing restore in the toolbar. you then lose any change you've done on the photo since the last memory.</seg>
<seg id="344">Virtually any image processing action can be reversed or restored. the last action can be reversed by editing or restoring Edit by selecting Edit Recover from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you use this frequently, you should call the keyboard shortcut, Ctrl; -Z to undo and remember Ctrl; -Shift-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you press the & LMB; by pressing the Return or Recover button in the toolbar for a moment, you will receive a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions are reversed or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started editing the image, you can move between the photos in the same album or keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar, image high, down or the entries in the File menu. if you have made changes to the current photo, you will be asked if you want to save them.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can enter the photo in and zoom out in which you can use Ctrl; scroll wheel or the icons in the toolbar or entries in the view menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: select the magnifying factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full Screen mode displays the picture in full screen mode. you enter the normal view in which you use the Esc button. normally, you can see the editing pane. if you do not want this, you can view it in the editing dialog; view the main window. see the section for setting up image editing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can select Print from the File menu and get the default & kde; print dialog. you can customize the settings before printing your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print single images or whole sets. all image preview pages can be printed from your selection. you only need to select the images with the standard methods and select Print Assist from the Album Edit menu. if you follow the wizard, you just need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The & digicam; main window has a sidebar on the right side, providing important information and actions for the selected images. the same sidebar is available without the navigation arrows, also in image processing. it is displayed when one of the five tabs is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple clicks on the same tab lets the sidebar appear or disappear again to the border.</seg>
<seg id="355">The text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed. labels are copied to the EXIF- and IPTC- fields so that you can be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are truncated after 2000 characters and special characters are reshaped. if you want to use the IPTC label field in other applications, you should consider these limitations.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you have commented, use either the Apply button or simply switch to the next image, the labels will then be saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">With this button you can read more metadata from the selected file or database. however, you can also write the metadata in the files, but this is always done when you have chosen a metadata adjustment that is always written in the images.</seg>
<seg id="359">The review shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting. it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars into the sidebar or with the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + 0... 5. to evaluate multiple images simultaneously, select it and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The evaluation is written in the IPTC-field urgency. the code follows the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword view displays a search box for filtering the keywords, the keyword tree and a selection box with the keywords used previously in this & digicam; session.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search word. you can limit the number of possibilities in search of a keyword quickly. this ability is particularly useful if you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom of the page is a further relief when entering keywords in a series of images. if you have entered different keywords, they are saved for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be entered in the tree by selecting the respective check boxes. all keywords of an image are stored in the keyword keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If multiple images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword tree, this only applies to the highlighted text and not to the entire selection, if you want to provide a selection with a keyword, please refer to the keyword filter section.</seg>
<seg id="366">The Keyword filter sidebar is used to change the selection of the images shown in the main window. normally, the left sidebar is used with their album, - datum-, keyword and search views. if additionally one or more keywords are used from the right side, only the intersection of these two is displayed. all created keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also draw and drop keywords. suppose you have selected multiple images in the main view to provide you with keywords. if the keyword already exists, you can simply pull it out of the right sidebar and place it on the selection. then a dialog appears asking you whether you want to set the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example, the main window displays the images on a calendar day. the keyword filter is set to No keywords, which reduces the amount to three images, and then a keyword is drawn from the right keyword tree to the selection and stored there. a dialog prompts whether this keyword should be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place every time you start the program. it can also be switched off under Settings.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created and find that it should be one or its, you can change this easily with a double click on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry after which is searched in the database. this can be an album, name, keyword, picture, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator, which is a name or string that is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can set an Advanced search on all the elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then select the group button. the options will then look like this:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why were Picasaweb or Flickr not listed? the free space is limited to 1GB and you won't want to save the images in full resolution there.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was mainly written by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I mainly edited it to & digicam; s concrete implementation adapted.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why you use a color-managed workflow is that the colours used by your camera or scanner will be a predictable deviation from the actual photographed or scanned colors. with a color-managed workflow you can achieve that the colors on your monitor are the same and that the colors you print or publish in the web that correspond to those from your digital dark room.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the topic comes to color management, everyone wants to know which buttons it needs to press for the results he wants. unfortunately, ink management means that you can make informed decisions at any point in the image processing workflows. in addition, you should provide you with sufficient background information about color management. in addition, you should allow you to make your own informed choices so that you can obtain the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below, you don't have to worry about color management.</seg>
<seg id="380">You work on a monitor that is calibrated to the sRGB color space. (see below for more information)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other picture editions are by email or the web, where sRGB is the de facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB works so well and makes life so easy for everyone, why should you use another color space and have to think about color manners?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of the limitation of sRGB compared to the colors we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors that we can see, the horseshoe-shaped region, and the colors in sRGB colour space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger color spaces, please visit Bruce Lindbloom's excellent site and click info and then information about RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I need to calliate my monitor if I decided to work only in sRGB color space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you are working in sRGB colour space or not, you have to callibrate your monitor, because sRGB is callibrated. the crystallization of your monitor closes the circle. if you are working as sRGB color space, you either need to set your monitor to the sRGB standard, use a matching monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections that can improve an image in most cases. therefore, use it before attempting any further manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions Normalizing, adjusting, Automatic balancing and contrast extend from the Correcting Automatic Correction Menu will automatically try to make the most of your colors. you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scales the denial values over the entire image, so that the darkest point black and the brightest dot will change as bright as possible without changing its shade.</seg>
<seg id="391">Similar: this method adjusts the intensity-factor of the color of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity channel becomes as flat as possible. sometimes it produces very good results in the improvement of the contrast of an image, sometimes it produces only garbage. it is a very powerful operation that works either miracles in a picture or it destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic balancing: this method maximizes the colour range in the red, green and blue channel. it detects the dark and bright border tones and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram section.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method improves the contrast and brightness of RGB value of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the widest possible range and a new jib of all values in between. this is only visible in full-washed images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digicam; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white balance correction is slightly limited as a color space with 8 bits per color is worked. so if you are too far from the original image, areas with overexposure may occur. if you can do the white balance in rough mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your possibilities for correction will be better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is copyrighted by Pawel T. Jochym. you can start it via menu entry colors white balance of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left you can see both the original image as well as the preview of the target image. the preview will dynamically adjust the settings of the tool. if you want to see the original white balance then it is enough to click on the subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photo has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel under this marker is shown as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">Right above is a histogram showing that dynamically changes as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well lit photos, most pixels have very small luminance values. with one button you can decide if one of the three colors or your total is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadow, saturation and gamma. the shade adjustment lets you enhance or lower the shadow details of your photos.</seg>
<seg id="401">To play Anstat with the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the color temperature of the white balance to calculate the color temperature of the white balance. in this way the temperature and green values are set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white balance with the list of preferences. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed. you will get the combined result in the white balance. this is indicated in preview as pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The Save As and Load buttons make exactly this. any adjustment of the white balance you have set can be saved to a text file and load later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The Preferences button sets back all filtervalues back to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance. note that even neutral settings will result in another picture than your original. if you save them, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can adjust the encoding depth per color channel of the edited image. 8-bit coding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit coding is better suited for high-quality images. this encoding also requires more disk space, computing time and is available only for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as the editing of color profiles. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. color mapping can be done through the subwindow for the brightness. detailed instructions for using color profiles can be consulted in the Color Management chapter.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is available in the menu under Colors Keep Correction. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels at the same time and allows you to use them for multiple photos. this is useful if your camera or scanner always make the same error and therefore always need the same correction.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful possibility to correct exposure issues is the tool for gradation that you will find under color gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digicam; tool color effects provide four color effects, a solar system effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a edge filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, Solarisation, also called Sabatier, was an effect that was created when a partially developed pressure applied a short flash light and then completed the development of the image. this had the effect that the brighter areas were darker and the colors were inverted by the second illumination. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar ionization. at approx. 50% intensity, the image shows what is chemically possible. a further increase finally creates a negative image that is not to be produced on photographic paper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar system effect. the original image is the (1) and it processes the (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from saturation by having a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. just try it, it embellishes many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers highly saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts. the characteristics make it a film of choice for nature photographers.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neon filter simulates neon light on the contrasting edges. the level controls the brightness of the result and the sliders repetitions the strength of the neon light. in large images the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and brightness of the photo. you can try to experiment the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors. once you are satisfied with the result use the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you make a photo in bad light conditions, you can get the reverse problem: a too big saturation. also in this case the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation rather than increase it. all changes you can perform can be previewed. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool gradation and the simple luminous intensity / contrast / gamma, the tool is based on a sound correction to improve the exposure. even if the dialog for this tool appears very complicated, you only need the area of the slide for the purpose explained here.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of the intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area. below the graph three sliders are clicked into which can be shifted to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn how to use it is to shift knob and observe how the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right you can see the original and the preview of the picture. the preview will be dynamically updated based on the settings of the image. the following options are available on the left.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box it is possible to adjust whether the histogram is represented with a linear or logarithmic Y axis. for images of a digital camera the linear histogram is dominated by a single column. in this case the logarithmic distribution is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three controls: the upper one for the dark tones, the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones, often called Gammaxes.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color pinboards can be used in preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of the shadows, middle and light tones. in addition, there is a button for fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controllers that can be used to change the output values interactively as with the input values. for example, the compression of the output values can be used to create a bleached image as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatic: with this button the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and store: with these buttons, the set values can be stored in the file system and loaded later. for this, the Gimp level format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and three color pipettes, the input values are automatically readjusted for all shadows, means and sun shades. activate the color pipette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the red, green, blue and the luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The Overexposure indicator controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it is no effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you can see an example of adjusting the input values to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original picture is marked with (1) and the corrected image with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left side, half of the original and the target image will be displayed. the preview will be dynamically updated depending on your preferences. the following options are available on the right:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modifier Channel: this selection box allows you to specify the channel that is modified by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">Next to this box are two icons to switch between a linear and a logarithmic view. for pictures taken with a digital camera is mostly the linear mode of the most useful. for pictures with large areas of a constant color, linear mode creates a wide bar. in this case, logarithmic mode will help.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a corner part to the right, i.e. the bright tones, you can see that these bright tones correspond with darker output tones and darker the corresponding pixels.</seg>
<seg id="436">When you move this marker on the area you want to change, a matching line appears on the curve representing the original value. create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted according to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and store: with these buttons you can do exactly that. every curve you created can be saved in the file system and loaded later. the file format for this is the Gimp curve format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you use this method and the three color pipettes automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels in the shadow, middle and sun tones. activate the color pipette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The Overexposure indicator controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels. if more than one channel overexposed pixels, you get the combined result. this is an indicator, i.e. you only get the effect displayed in the preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black-and-white photo that was corrected in the LuminanzCanal. shadow and sun shades were set with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original picture is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The digicam channel mixer; image processing is a tool for improving the color channels or changing the colour shades of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colour tones of the images. you can edit it from the menu Colors Mixer of the Image Processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selection box, you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first note how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and precipitation. the left pane of the window will show you a preview. the original can be viewed for comparison with your own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position it in the picture, a vertical line appears in the histogram to indicate the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are right below: controls for Red, Green and Building allow you to mix these channels. if you enable Luminance, the image will retain the overall brightness, even if you also enable the option Monochrome, since the channel mixer is then THE tool for creating great black and white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when mixing monochrome, the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the colour space. colour space consists of small room artefacts that do not appear at the same spot in the color channel and whose noise patterns appear different in each channel. if that's the case, you can improve your monochrome version by first reducing the color space.</seg>
<seg id="447">The Save as and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any mixer setting can be saved for later and then loaded. the used file format is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The Overexposure indicator controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it is no effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a picture in which the blue channel has been readjusted. the Luminance option is checked. the original image is under (1) and the processed image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your ability to abstract. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a work step, as color images can easily be converted to the computer. also with a set of movie roller profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">The Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter. this looks good at all scene pictures and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky. thus similar to the 004 Cokin (tm) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and aerial photos. thus, similar to the 002 Cokin (tm) orange filter.</seg>
<seg id="454">Red filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic celestial effects and can simulate moonlight scenes at the time of the day. thus, similar to the 003 Cokin (tm) red filter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color tone correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 Cokin (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">SepiSheraton: produces warm light and medium tones while it adds a bit of cold to the leaves. this is very similar to the process of bleaching a pressure and re-development in a Sepiatoner. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and therefore similar to the 005 Cokin (tm) squamic filter.</seg>
<seg id="457">Use the & digicam; apply tool texture to apply decorative textures to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, regardless of whether it is a color picture or not, you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas, the stitch of an old master, a pop art portrait from enlarged points or like a wall painting on a wall.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: move this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three-dimensionality of the texture on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper text effect has been applied in the picture below. the original picture is (1) and the modified less (2) to see. the relief parameter has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the & digicam; Add tool frame can be added a decorative frame around a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of a viewer within the limits of a photo is not an easy task. a way to keep your attention is to expose the image to a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier for the scattering eye. under picture frame, the module can be started from image processing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter you set the desired frame type for your picture. continuous the image with a colored line, Niepce surrounds it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black and white pictures), rounded it with a nice three-dimensional frame which is ideal for a knock effect and decorative adding a decorative frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: is the width of the frame in percent. the value range for the width is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">The target image decorated with the frame will be larger than the original, but have the same aspect ratio. this is important for the print of the images, especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this handy tool, you can easily insert a formatted text into an image at any location. this is also possible in several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply enter the text and place it with the mouse. use text direction, orientation, color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need it. the larger the image, the bigger the character set.</seg>
<seg id="468">Each setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you click the "OK" button. once the image has been saved, the text is part of the image. it can no longer be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">With the & digicam; tool template you can put a template on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The Menu Image Template can be used in image processing can be used to place templates over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template there are no limitations concerning size and orientation. however, you need to take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compressing (9) to reduce the file size of the template. if you want to add your template from the & digicam; Schablonendatenbank, just send an e-mail in Englisch to the & digicam; Mailing list digicam-users @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time, you need to put your stencil-folder with the button root folder in the dialog. select the folder in which you have copied the stencil files. these settings are scheduled for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder has been set for the templates appears a tree view that reflects the folder structure of the template folder. the selection of a folder automatically updates the preview toolbar of the templates.</seg>
<seg id="474">Below the preview you will find three buttons that allow you to change the magnification factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button enlarges the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Shrink: this button shrinks the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template to the whole picture, you have to zoom the image accordingly. check with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move the image lying under the template. take the image and place it at the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to apply the template to your image. the image is then automatically adapted to the preview size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digicam; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but produces grainy images especially in dark areas.</seg>
<seg id="481">The sharpness mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture sharper. actually it sharpens not a bit, it works rather psychically uell. you can use it to remove atmospheric haze and it makes here a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is protected by copyright by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocusing is possibly the best of the three because it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="483">Images without focus and most digitalized images require a correction of the sharpness. this is because the digitization process must combine colors with only minimal differences to a color point. this, in turn, results in blurred edges. the same phenomenon can be observed when ink points are printed on paper. SLR cameras normally need more subsequently sharpening than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">Images in raw format, on the other hand, must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners turn a focus filter back while reading the image. if you disable this, you will get control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can obtain useful results by sharpening a photo using the sharpening tool.</seg>
<seg id="487">The sharpness increases the sharpness of the edges, but also strengthens the noise. in general, the most suitable technique for sharpening an image intensifies the tool. you can refocus it via the menu entry Correcting. under refocussing you will find more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crisp. the solution to draw the image a little soft is much easier than sharpen it. use the tool for the soft sign with the menu entry Correct plasticise and experiment with settings. the preview window on the right of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The Filter Exclusive masking is a very good tool to remove veils from your photos. a demonstration you can see here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help you to edit the image. the preview window will show the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often generate good results and should be tested first. increasing the radius or amount of the amount increase the effect. if you make the blurring mask too strong, noise and the impression of grates will produce near sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius represents how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii. therefore, you should best sharpen images in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount indicates the percentage between the original and the blurred image one which is added to the original. thus, the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the difference amount. thus, the minimum difference is defined for an edge of the filter. thus areas with a soft change between the tones are exempt from sharper and hence beauty errors in faces, skies and water surfaces are avoided.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the blurred filter. the original image is the (1) and the processed image (2). fuzzy mask was used with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digicam; tool refocus refocus a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyrighted foldable filtering algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This is a better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Vienna film. the traditional technique for sharpening images is the use of a blur mask. refocus normally allows better results than blurred. you can start it from the menu by refocusing colors in image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular folding works much better than the Gauß'sche folding. the Gauss's fold has a very long tail, which leads to the mathematical result also depends on the source pixels that are far from original source pixels. in most cases, the FIR Vienna inverse of the Gauß's folding is even very strongly influenced by the distant pixels.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most pictures, the default value should be 1 good results. you can set a higher value if your image is blurred and then pay attention to halo notes.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help reduce artifacts. the correlation can be selected by 0-1. usable values are 0,5 and the values near 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharper effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filter: increasing the noise filter can help you reduce artifacts. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, & eg; 0 the image quality is very bad. a usable value is 0.03. a high value will consume the image even further.</seg>
<seg id="502">Sharpness: this is the radius for the sharpness of the sharpness. use this parameter if your sharpness Gauß is' sch '. in most cases, you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying artifacts. if you use a non-zero value, you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase in die size can generate good results, especially if you select large values for the spherical sharpness or the sharpness of the sharpness. note however that the module is very slow when you select large values for this parameter. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The Save as and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any refocused parameter you set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to complete all trimming, color and intensity corrections before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before changing the picture elsewhere. the reason for this is that much operations changes which are not immediately visible, but leave untouched artifacts later.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you read and compress images, than JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally Unintentional Masquerade produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by the inability to mask a larger neighborhood than sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of the blurring. for the Viennese filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal Lineare Filter. practically the result of the FIR Vienna filter is always at least as good as the blurring mask. the FIR Vienna filter is often better in the processing of small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters, applied on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp color image that needs to be corrected. this image has been made using an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the methods of correction in digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English at this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The knob smoothes the blurring of the area that has been darkened to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">The ink ink allows a customized color for the pupil. if you want to have blue eyes instead of dark ones, you can set this here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The image error correction tool is one of the most developed tools to remove unwanted artifacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The painting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains various presets as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available presets are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings more finely, you can use the tab smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Attention to detail p [0, 100]: this controls the maintenance of the details. a small value leads to smooth smoothing over the image. whereas larger values are mainly homogenous regions smoothing and details sharp. a value of 0.9 should preserve details so that no sharpening should be arranged afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="520">Direction dependence alpha [0,100]: a small amount smoothes evenly in all directions, while a value is flattened to 1 only in one direction. if you have a film granulation or CCD roughen will generate a high value wave-like pattern. JPEG artifacts are best removed at a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smoothing [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore, set this value corresponding to the degree of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoothed, because it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repeat: indicates how often the algorithm is traversed. normally here 1 or 2 is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle increment [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if alpha is chosen small, there should also be small choice. make sure that small angles produce a long running time. you should therefore choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integrated step width [0,1, 10]: integral step width in pixels. you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never larger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Use linear interpolation: the increase in quality that you receive by choosing this option is just low, but it doubles the running time. we recommend it to leave it out.</seg>
<seg id="527">The Save As and Load buttons make this exactly. any setting of image errors can be saved to a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Correcting image errors is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take very long time to load a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how image errors are corrected using small artifacts. the module will be applied to a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you see there is a peculiar black artifact in the foreground that caused by poor film storage during the trip. the original image is under (1) to see and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digicam; noise reduction is a very powerful tool for reducing noise. it uses a proprietary algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artefacts, e.g. dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and high ISO sensitivity. it shows a granular noise that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">The following is a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow details and the Advanced Settings window can remain with default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius checks the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) used for the filter. large values increase the time the filter is used per pixel and can blur the image. the area indicated by the radius is smoothed and the color in it is smoothed and thus smaller mistakes are cleared.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpness level. this value sets the pixel gap between the filter to the front to determine luminance changes. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details will no longer be preserved and smokers or blacksors appear again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: check edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, not all noise can be removed or noise peaks can occur. set it to a value close to the maximum, if you want to remove a weak rustle or JPEG-artifacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the light density tolerance of the image. we recommend you change color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend you change color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the image tolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas typically smoked. however, it also merges the shadow areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: controls the adjustment of phase jitter damping. this value defines how quickly the adaptive filter radius reacts to variations of the luminance density. when it is elevated, the edges appear smoother when it is too high, noise and phase jitter appear at the edges. it can remove noise peaks and is the recommended method for this.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save under and load: these buttons are used exactly for this. all the noise reduction parameters that you have set can be saved to the file system and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original picture is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2).</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crunchy for your purpose. fortunately, the solution to draw the image a little soft is fortunately much easier than blurring a picture. use tool for softer with the menu entry Correcting softwines and experiment with the smoothing. the preview window on the right of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digicam; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photographic artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">These filters for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artifacts from your pictures. it is very well adapted to remove Gauß 'noise, film graining, scratches, compression artefacts and local errors appearing in digital, original or subsequently digitalized images.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for color and texture translation. the texture translation is done with another tool, the image error correction, and the algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG data artifacts reduce: compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far away from it. as a lossless compression algorithm, it produces some compression & quot; Artefacts quot; - small standards that are seen in uncompressed image. this setting should correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The Save As and Load buttons make this exactly. any setting of photo restoration can be saved to a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take very long time to load a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time by pressing the button.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can reduce as a photo with uniform noise reduction restored.. The module is applied to a black and white photo that has been recorded with a Minolta (tm) 700si camera to an Ilford (tm) HP-5 Film with a Sensitivity of 3200 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time textures have been reduced to an old color photo that has been scanned with a scanner. you can see the scan artifacts that were caused by the scanner illumination and the photo paper. the original image is visible under (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">Die & digicam; tool Hotpixel supports hotpixels of photos that were shot with a CCD camera gem, eight were used. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project, protected by copyright by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead or hot pixels are a problem especially for high-quality raw-mode photos, as many cameras with AF compression feature built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixels quot; and "quot; bright pixel quot; on a photo with a dark image subtraction method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Load this file in the wizard with the dark image button. the tool will automatically detect the hot and light pixels. these are highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera it is important that you capture the dark image directly after connecting new hot or bright pixels with CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should load the appropriate dark image to the image to be corrected. automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels. note that the wizard remembers the last dark image and automatically loads it in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and preview help you to correct the result within the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings. poor pixels are raised in all preview areas.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area around the broken pixels to preview and see the results of the filter. then select the best filter method to interpolate these pixels. these are the available filters:</seg>
<seg id="561">Average: an average of the neighbor pixel is determined. the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels having a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel correction on a color photo, taken from a corrupt digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure. the original image has been enlarged to 300% (1) and the corrected image is shown below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digitised; Vignetting correction is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e. underexposed corners, an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lenses, especially the medium and large photo format, can often not uniformly illuminate the entire sensor range. instead & quot; vignetting wroth; (shaded) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there. telephoto lenses may also show this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">Many center filters require a factor 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter, which makes it impossible to keep the camera by hand. wide angle lenses should, even with center filters, use an aperture of f / 16 or smaller, because otherwise the blurring effects are caused by movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large exposures of today's film and color or grayscale depth of digital cameras and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a center filter by using an equivalent transformation on a raw image without this filter. the tool vignetting correction transforms the transformation with a center filter to a picture. the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three controls, you can control the Vignetting Correction Filter and with three further exposures of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light absorption at the point of the largest density filtering. the standard density is 2.0, which corresponds to an optical filter with an aperture setting of 1, or by chance of a luminous intensity of 2, reduce it to compensate for a small degree of vignetting.</seg>
<seg id="572">Luminous intensity, contrast, and gamma settings: editing an image with the vignetting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels. you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options. the controls only provide positive values, as you only need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a more fine adjustment of the exposure of the target image, leave the values for brightness / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation from the & digicam; image processing from the Color Gradation menu.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the vignetting correction applied to one image. the original image (1) shows the vignetting in the corners and (2) the corrected image.</seg>
<seg id="575">Die & digicam; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. color distortions cannot be corrected with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second gradient deals with the general geometrical distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex shape of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect, but flattens at the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient fourth gradient corrects the remote corners opposite to that of the second gradient. if you combine these two, any geometrical distortion can be almost eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">In general, this value controls the severity of distortion 2nd degree. negative values can be corrected with tension-shaped distortion and positive values cushion distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the strength of distortion fourth. this value is stronger at the edges than in the middle of the image. for most lenses, the 'Corner Parameters function has the reverse sign of the parameter general.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value scales the image size and thus corrects initial grading. larger negative values increase while positive image resizes.</seg>
<seg id="583">Brightening: this value adjusts the brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase it.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialog with a preview shows the distortion correction. the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start.</seg>
<seg id="585">The ton- and cushion-shaped correction should be performed before all trimming or size changes. best perform this correction as the first. if you re-cut a picture and then perform a sound-shaped correction the effect would seem obvious to the wrong.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction, this tool will provide you with a vertical and horizontal aid line. move the mouse cursor in the image preview to display the dotted lines. move it to an important location, such as the sea edge or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. then, you can correct the ton- / cushion distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a cushion distortion, the resulting image will have black corners. you can remove those with the trimming tool in the Transforming Cutting out of the Image Processing or via the Zoom slider of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">For most pictures the sound-shaped correction extends. the next logical step for some motives, e.g. shots of front, frame and painting, it is the perspective to correct that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees. note that when holding the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the sound-shaped correction applied to a church in Norway. the original picture is under (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method for simulating the infrared film of the Gimpanzo.org website which is accessible under this URL. the filter reproduces the known Ilford (tm) SFX200 Iinfrared, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can adjust two parameters set of film grading and film sensitivity (ISO). add the option Add movie granulment if you want to simulate the grainy texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO regulator changes the amount of film granularity and the dominance of color green (chlorophyll in nature) in conversion. green meadows are white like snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Because the filter blends color channels for the reproduction of infrared film, especially the green channel makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos, as the color information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infra-red filter effect applied to a landscape photograph from New Zealand. the original image is below (1) and the processed image below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values create a kind of aura in the pointed lights.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digitised; filter film granularity is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce film grading on your images. this is known from classic high-speed films such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the films, manufacturers are mixing large silver grains of the photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film composition effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back into the past. the treated picture gets rid of a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life. if you want this special, gallery-like, street photographic, granular sight especially in your monochrome photos, you need to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">The regulator can calibrate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although often higher values are required, set to ISO-2400. if you need even more grains, you can apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film composition effect applied to a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and that worked the (2). the film sensitivity used corresponds to ISO 1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The digicam; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting. it uses an appropriate copyrighted algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digitised; Filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting. nature pictures and still life are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two controls to influence this effect. the upper one chooses the brush size between one and five. thicker brushes are better suited for large images.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original picture is marked with the (1) and the machined is marked with the (2). brush size for this 640 pixel size picture is 1 and smooth 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digitised; Filter Carbon Drawing uses color and intensity gradients to create a cabbage sketch. images whose gradients vary slowly are therefore not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine which scene you had chosen to sketch out. these would be good pictures to start with.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controllers with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper knob selects the pin size and the lower adjusts the contrast (smoothing).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the carbon capture filter. the original picture (1) and the changed image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digitised; filter engravings shapes your picture in 3-D as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digitised; filter engravure is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3-D effect. it works particularly well with images with a simple structure, where color is not the most important of the content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a grey, mondaring landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to set the contrast of the filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the processed image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal picture into a work of art by distorting effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: divide the image into cells and make it look as if it is considered by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave blocks 2: analogous to the wave blocks 1, the image is distorted by a different version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time by pressing the button.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of blur effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Fiction: blurred the image along star-shaped lines that emanate from a center point. this simulates the blurring of a zooming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression that is often seen in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial blurring: blurrings the image by rotating the pixels around a center point. this simulates the blurring of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance blurring: blurred the image to create the effect of unfocused camera lens. the object appears to appear in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Blurring: blurring the image by horizontal movements of the pixels. this simulates the blurring of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train taking photographs, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Blurring blurring: blurrings the image smoothly into the dark and strongly in bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or adding a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Sharpness sharpness: blurrings the image by means of random displacement of the pixels and thus simulates the blurring of an arbitrarily moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent blurring: finds the ink in the picture and wipes it without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: divide the photo into rectangular cells and then create it by filling with an average pixel value, new.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. you can cancel this calculation at any time by pressing the button.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool to make raindrops on your picture. this gives it natural to your pictures a wet look. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn copyrighted algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Dropping size allows to change the size of the drops. since the droplet size does not grow automatically with the size of the image it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images. number changes the number and density of drops. fissures changes the optical effect of drops on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can use the digicam; image processing to keep an area free of raindrops. use the selection tool to select the area, e.g. a face that should remain free. if you then start the filter regentropfen, the area will remain free of raindrops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the Regentropfen Filters. the original picture (1) shows a quiet sunset and the processed image (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can move it through mirroring or rotating into the correct orientation.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo inflating is definitely one of the most developed tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">The big question is how can you inflate a picture and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom in or guess the missing information? the CImg algorithm used here makes a good job. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. select to change size in the menu and enter the target values. the dialog is shown below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool for size change uses a linear interpolation method to approximate the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small image with a better quality then try the tool for blowing.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image editing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. Spline Interpolation to enlarge an image. & digicam; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo inflating was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS Labors in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to tell the tool how to change the size. these settings are available in tab New size and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Retained aspect ratio: if this setting is enabled, the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoothed, because it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The Save As and Load buttons are used for this purpose. enlarging each stunt for photo can be saved as a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo inflating is very fast with what it does, but it can take a long time and load a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example for photo inflating by adding a small color image to the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged image (3). the preview (2) is the result of linear expansion.</seg>
<seg id="640">Editing a photo is not only a frequently performed operation, but also a frequently underestimated tool to put a picture together. to cut a photo, you just need to use the mouse to crop the rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and dragging the rectangle. you will see this rectangle then while you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">You can change the size of the area to be trimmed by dragging on the corners of the rectangle. you can create a new rectangle by simply dragging it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cut, use the button The Ctrl; + X (Ctrl; + X) button. use the Save or Save File menu item in the File menu to save the newly cut photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the preview pane, you can change the size of the rectangle by dragging the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog will be preserved.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool After aspect ratio, you can specify orientation as high-format or landscape format. in high-format, always the greater value of the height and in the cross-format of the width is assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">This means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimeters, inches or any other physical size. for example, you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog, two buttons exist to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">At the bottom of the dialog you can use the Max. ratio button to set the area for cutting to the widest possible, depending on the selected relationship and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">When you use the cutting tool the next time, these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation. the changed picture dimensions are stored in the EXIF tables, so that the EXIF data will reflect the cropped image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of setting help allow you to blend aids so that you can better put your pictures together. these aids are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonious triangle: harmonious divisions are based on the principle of similarity. like the third-angels, harmonious triangles are a way to divide a rectangle with similarly harmonic triangles at the diagonal.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden middle: the golden middle is a division that on various natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the blades of a sunflower. it appears in all possible things that we feel as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden division is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks who constructed your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden division at all times when you put together your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number derives from Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc; the resulting divider is 1: 1.618 the golden middle.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden center provides liquid auxiliaries when composing a picture. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spiral will bring you closer to your goal for your photos. compared to the third-party rule, the golden spiral generates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the picture. this type of composition results in the viewer's gaze on the line of the spiral and creates a symmetrical visual flow in this way.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. these rectangles are used to create the golden spiral. it should give something that the eye is in the center of the composition. it can be a line or different objects. this something can simply be there without directing the eye, it will fulfill its task.</seg>
<seg id="657">The golden triangles also derive from the gold spiral discussed above. their vertices are the center points of the sides of the golden rectangles.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use gold triangles to break your frame, create an effect that is called dynamic symmetry by professional photographer. try to place your focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="659">The horizontal mirror and vertical mirror options can be used to mirror the harmonic parts.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the Color button you can set the color of the guide lines. if you have an image with many colors and a high contrast, the help lines can be invisible. in this way, you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">When you make a photo then it happens easily that you do not keep the camera vertical or horizontal. this creates a picture in which things are rotated around an angle. you can do this with the & digicam; image editing and tool free rotation repair. choose to transform the free rotation and adjust the angle of the angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your image with the slider angle. the values on this slide are indicated in degrees. with the knob presets you can set the slider to 0 degrees. a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image are displayed at the top right corner.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line. move the cursor in the image preview to position the two lines. after moving it over an important point of the image, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After having turned a picture you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. one way to fix this is to use the function Transformers Cut out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is the automatic cutting function. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The Anti-Aliasing option smoothes the picture a bit after the rotation. but note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspective transformations are carried out around a fixed point to the so-called reference point. this point is in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview is then automatically recomputed. on the right hand side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you to change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New Width: displays the width of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: displays the height of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle at the top left: indicates the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle to the right: displays the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed zone.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle on the left: displays the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle to the right: indicates the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed zone.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective, the image is slightly wasted. for a single adaptation, this effect is small, but two adjustments generate a double that effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you have adapted the perspective you get unpleasant triangular holes in the corners. one way to clean this is to cut the picture with transformers cropping out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">A horizontal scaling, for example, will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the lower part to the left. this is no rotation, the image is distorted. in other words, a rectangle is turned into a parallelogram. you can start this module about transforming scissors.</seg>
<seg id="679">Rotate your image by using the Horizontal angle and vertical angle. if you press presets, the angle will be reset to zero. a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be displayed to the right of the preview pane.</seg>
<seg id="680">To your help a vertical and horizontal line are displayed. move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall from a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the shelling tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have done the scaling, the picture is blurred a bit. for a single shearing, this effect is mostly negligible, but two shittings generating twice as much blurring and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After scaling, the picture has unsightly triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate them is to cut the picture with transformers from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digitised; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. the available formats therefore depend on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries are compiled. in most distributions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & digicam; edit.</seg>
<seg id="684">Because of this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on your system. however, you will always find JPEG and TIFF under it.</seg>
<seg id="685">This happens by means of file extension and comparison with a pre-defined list. if the extension is listed in the list, it is edited and digitised. you can change this list of file extensions to the & digicam; you can change it. in the configuration section, you will find more information about it.</seg>
<seg id="686">Virtually all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras allow you to select even the format you want to use. a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia. & digicam; supports both formats.</seg>
<seg id="687">Image compression is the application of data compression methods to digital images. redundant information is reduced in order to save image data in a more efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="688">JPEG 2000 is also supported. in general, there are better, smoother than JPEG during the same compression ratio. the 2000s version can also be saved without loss when specified in the settings.</seg>
<seg id="689">If you want to know more about the raw video format, you can read in Colour most helpful guidances in English from Wikipedia, The Luminous Landscape and Cambridge in Colour. you can convert raw format images to JPEG or TIFF with the Raè image converter. in the config section, you will find further information on how to use modules with & digicam;.</seg>

<seg id="700">Many tools you need to edit photos have been digitized and digitized. your description will follow here.</seg>
<seg id="701">All image processing tools such as sharpening, softmark, noise suppression, refocus, masks, etc;. use a uniform dialog type that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image. below you see & quot; texture apply; in this dialog:</seg>
<seg id="702">(1): this progress bar displays the status of the filter to the current picture. to the left of it allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the preview area. these modes are:</seg>

<seg id="710">(5): in the lower left corner: here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values. all settings from the last use of the module are noted.</seg>
<seg id="711">The Properties page displays the essential information about the selected image and is largely self-explanatory. it is grouped in the following sections:</seg>
<seg id="712">Photo Properties: displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photo. these data are from the EXIF data when they are available.</seg>
<seg id="713">This tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Marble mini program. you can move in or out or hold it on the mouse wheel. press Ctrl; left mouse button to move around a square. all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed. of course, this assumes your images contain Geo data.</seg>
<seg id="714">& kcoloredit; is an editor for palettes. the application can be used for editing color palettes and selecting and naming colors.</seg>
<seg id="715">The pallets files installed by & kde can apply either to the whole system or only one user. in the latter case, they are in your Personal Folder for & kde; -Settings and hot Custom color and last used colors.</seg>
<seg id="716">In the palette, you can select from a list of installed pallets or browse the folders by files.</seg>
<seg id="717">The cursor is shown as a line in the pallet view. it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color.</seg>
<seg id="718">The color is described below the palette view. here, the color name can also be changed.</seg>
<seg id="719">It can also be used for selections. to create such a selection, click the area next to a color to move the cursor to it. then move the mouse with the left mouse button pressed.</seg>
<seg id="720">If the check box Use Cursor under the button Color is enabled, the color is inserted from the color table on the cursor. the color is either inserted or overwritten another; depending on whether the overwrite mode is selected. this mode can be adjusted by selecting the check box under Beim Cursor.</seg>
<seg id="721">A selection that was created as described in the last section can be used together with the actions Copy, Cut and Paste.</seg>
<seg id="722">& kcoloredit; uses the following format for data in the clipboard: for each color three values for the portions of red, green and blue and an optional color name followed by a newline if another color follows. so if there are three numerical values in the clipboard, they can be inserted as a color in & kcoloredit;</seg>
<seg id="723">The colors in the palette and the color selection output can be dragged with the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="724">Select a color somewhere on the screen and then find it in the color selector on the left.</seg>
<seg id="725">Graphs are used in science, especially in computer science. so far there was no modern & GUI; program, which contains & graphviz; contains, according to the program author obsolete & X11; - or & tcltk; -Programs with only a few functions.</seg>
<seg id="726">The & kgraphs; -Project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user-friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated & kde; program.</seg>
<seg id="727">& kgraphs Viewer; is a KDE program for viewing & graphviz; -dot; graphs. the & graphviz; -Programs are free layout programs. & kgraphs; displays graphs with all possibilities of a well integrated & kde; program in a modern and user-friendly & GUI; an. it has the following functions:</seg>
<seg id="728">Integration in & kate; and & konqueror; (so that a change of the graph in & kate; the graph is recomputed and in & kgraphs;)</seg>
<seg id="729">Menu to open the graph in & kate; open or graph in & kgraphs; in a & kate; component to open</seg>
<seg id="730">Loading large graphs (currently there are problems from about 1000 nodes and a hack to represent more than these nodes)</seg>
<seg id="731">Further required software: & kgraphs; is a & kde; program, which requires the & graphviz; -tool & dot; for displaying the graph presupposed. in detail:</seg>
<seg id="732">The main window displays the opened graphs, each in its own subwindow. initially, when you start & kgraphs; without starting an argument, the main window is empty as in the lower screen shot. in this case, the toolbar contains just the icon file and the (empty) list of last opened files. click the first icon to open the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="733">After you have selected one or more & dot files, the main window looks like in the lower screenshot:</seg>
<seg id="734">As you can see, an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the canvas. you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically.</seg>
<seg id="735">Use the mouse wheel (high and down without special keys, left and right with pressed & alt; key);</seg>
<seg id="736">The zooming is restricted in both directions by a factor of 10. below you can see the maximum size reduction of a graph.</seg>
<seg id="737">If the currently in & kgraphs; loaded file has been modified by another program, the following window will be displayed:</seg>
<seg id="738">You can choose whether the graph should be reloaded or whether you want to ignore the change. & kgraphs Viewer; can also remember your decision, so that later the same procedure is done. if you want to change your decision later, you can use the menu item Preferences coldviewer; set up... see also.</seg>
<seg id="739">When you open a graph file outside a running & graphic viewer; instance open, and eg; in the file browser or the command line, you have the choice whether you want to open a new & graphic viewer; instance or to display the graphs in a sub-window of the existing instance.</seg>
<seg id="740">As with the last option, you can save your choice permanently, but also change it with the Setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="741">When starting the program, you can open all the graphs of your last session. again, you can save your choice as well as change later.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can also specify how to split the graph to several pages. the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely selected.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you use several pages, you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come to a page should be fitted to this page, ignoring the aspect ratio. if you maintain the aspect ratio, the pages may not be filled out by the respective sections of the graph.</seg>
<seg id="744">Page preview with one on several pages distributed graphene without header and with another font</seg>
<seg id="745">The Erneut Load page gives you the ability to specify the behavior when a file has been modified on your hard drive, & eg; from another program. you can set a default behavior (automatically recharge or ignore changes) or let the program review each time.</seg>
<seg id="746">When opening a graph outside a current session, you can set a default behavior (open the graph in a new window or in a subwindow of the already running session) or determine that every time it is requested.</seg>
<seg id="747">The session administration page gives the possibility to specify the startup behavior of & kgraphs. you can set a default behavior (open or not open the files of the last session or not) or decide to be asked for each start afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="748">The context menu, which appears normally with a click in the main window with the & RMBN, opens up additional options:</seg>
<seg id="749">Here you can choose among various & graphviz; layout algorithms. the entries as described on the website of & graphviz are:</seg>
<seg id="750">It produces hierarchical or layered graphs of aligned graphs. the algorithm defines the edges in the same direction (from top to bottom or from left to right) and then attempts to produce as short edges and as few edge overlaps as possible.</seg>
<seg id="751">The & Neato; -algorithm is the standard for ungerized graphs. it produces representations in accordance with the springboard model. the Kamada-Kawai algorithm is used, which is synonymous with statistical multi-dimensional scaling.</seg>
<seg id="752">The & FDP; -algorithm generates a spring-spring model layout for ungerized graphs. it uses the fruit-man-pure gold heuristics, and includes a multi-wire solver for the treatment of large and clustered graphs.</seg>
<seg id="753">The & Circo; -algorithm arranges the nodes circle according to the description of Six and Tollis, 1999, and Kauffman and Wiese, 2002. it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cyclic structures.</seg>
<seg id="754">Opens a dialog where you can specify a layout command which will then be executed by a shell. the command should accept the graphene file as a parameter, and render the calculated layout of the graph to stdout in xdot format. with such a layout command you can specify & eg; the & graphviz; -algorithms give special options, or also change the graph with a filter before it is drawn.</seg>
<seg id="755">Determines the type of graphene (directed or executed) and applies the standard algorithm for each type (dot; for directed, & neato; for non-executed graphs).</seg>
<seg id="756">If this setting is activated, the overview will be displayed if necessary. otherwise it will not be displayed and the positioning menu is inactive.</seg>
<seg id="757">Display the What is the mouse pointer. with this mouse cursor click on a & GUI; element to get more help to this item (if available).</seg>
<seg id="758">A list of changes is available at this address and in the file ChangeLog in the base folder of the source archive.</seg>
<seg id="759">& kgraphs Viewer; is a & kde; program that uses the & graphviz; tools for displaying. it requires the following program packages:</seg>
<seg id="760">A special setup is not necessary to use & kgraphs; you will find more options in the Settings menu.</seg>
<seg id="761">The main editor window is divided into five areas: the main toolbar, the bar for drawing tools, the status bar, the .color palette and the grid, in which you draw the icon.</seg>
<seg id="762">Create a new icon. if the current file has been modified, you will be asked if you want to save the changes. after that, a dialog will appear where you can choose to create the symbol from a template or whether you want to restart from scratch.</seg>
<seg id="763">Restores the last one-made step. if you do not have a step undo, this function is disabled.</seg>
<seg id="764">Inserts the clipboard contents as a new image (if the clipboard contains a symbol).</seg>

<seg id="772">The KIPI module displays images to read and save new images.</seg>
<seg id="773">This module can be used to read and save new images from external sources. currently, two sources can be used:</seg>
<seg id="774">Scan images: use the Kooka interface to read images from a scanner that supports the Sane project or another source such as Video Streams. for this to work you have to have Kooka and Sane installed.</seg>
<seg id="775">When you open the menu item Pictures, a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer. select the source from which you want to get the image. you can also set the default source for the next time.</seg>
<seg id="776">After that, the Kooka window will appear by replacing the default values ducrrh in order to select your image accordingly. watch the preview and adjust the area to your needs before you scan the image. the estimated file size will be displayed in the right, bottom corner. in the Kooka manual, you will find more information.</seg>
<seg id="777">Make sure the window is completely displayed as some settings may not be displayed otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="778">After you have pressed the button, you have to wait until the scan is finished and the window to set the options of the target image appears. please remember that the BMP type is not compressed and therefore creates very large files. you also need to select the folder & # 160; select or create by saving the image.</seg>
<seg id="779">You can create screenshots after you have selected the Import &gt; Screen Window... button. a window appears where you can set the different screenshots:</seg>
<seg id="780">Select the complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="781">If all of your program window is selected, the calling program will disappear, so that you can view other screens and windows. otherwise, after a short delay, you will read the currently visible workspace. if you have selected the complete work surface only the window under the mouse will be read.</seg>
<seg id="782">The delay determines how long screen shot is waiting before it starts. if you need to switch to other worktops, you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate.</seg>
<seg id="783">After the screenshot has been created, the dialog options for the target image appears with the options described above.</seg>
<seg id="784">The KIPI module does not currently have documentation. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Please note: the participants in this list speak English.</seg>

<seg id="796">Flickr is an online photo management on the internet. with Flickr it is possible to send photos to the people that are important to you. you can show your favorite photos of the world showing photos of your camera and showing your photos safely and privately to your friends and family around the world.</seg>
<seg id="797">The Exporting module to Flickr can be used to upload images from your computer to a Flickr server on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="798">If you use the module for the first time you will be guided through the process of generating a token. it is used for your authentication so it is your ID to Flickr. a browser is started so you can log in on Flickr.</seg>
<seg id="799">After the successful registration, the module can send photos to Flickr website. you will be presented the following page after a successful login.</seg>
<seg id="800">Simply close the browser window and return to the program. once you have pressed Yes, you will get the dialog to upload photos to Flickr. this will be shown in the next section.</seg>
<seg id="801">When the export module is launched to Flickr for the second time, you will be greeted with the following dialog, which displays the current access permissions that the module displays. currently, you need write permission. the module currently does not support other permissions. you will be asked if you want to continue with these permissions.</seg>
<seg id="802">The button to add photos should be pressed once after you have all other options set. with this button you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box. click on the Ok button to start uploading the photos to Flickr server.</seg>
<seg id="803">The Tags field can be filled with a comma-separated list of words. these are added to the image as keywords during upload.</seg>
<seg id="804">With the Public, Friends and Famillie options, you can set the access permissions to your pictures. by default, the photos are classified as private.</seg>
<seg id="805">If you change the option Modify the size of the photos before uploading, the photos will be changed before uploading in size. the size is taken from the value entered at maximum size.</seg>
<seg id="806">The maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images. the size is changed in such a way that the aspect ratio remains constant.</seg>
<seg id="807">The KIPI module Galerie-Export is a tool for exporting your picture collection to a gallery server</seg>

<seg id="809">The KIPI module for geographical localization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image. geographic data is saved in the EXIF keywords of the image and localisation can be displayed in a map in an external browser.</seg>
<seg id="810">The KIPI module for geographical localization provides tools for locating images geographically in spherical coordinate system, which is used by GPS and Galileo. height, longitude and latitude are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your pictures with geographical data you need a GPS track as XML file in the GPX format. psbabel and gpsman can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Image Geographical localisation correlator. this interface can merge a number of previously selected pictures with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images you want to correlate in the main window and call the menu. the above-to-see dialog appears then. to allow a possible correlation between time and localization, you need to load a track file with GPX file.</seg>
<seg id="814">When the file is loaded, an automatic correlation is performed which indicates the coordinates in red. GPS track data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be recalculated by GMT. this can be done with time zone. set your camera time zone here.</seg>
<seg id="815">Setting for maximum time deviation is an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera time. if the deviation is below, the data is merged. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you have no track data from a location for images, you can manually edit the GPX file and add to the images. the time difference of 2000 seconds will then correlate all images in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolate and difference in minutes can be used if you don't have the right data. if you know that in reality a location is located in a great time difference between camera and GPS, you can set these limits here and then press the button correlative to interpolate.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set manually with this dialog. this is useful if you have made a number of photos in the same place. as the dialog opens the coordinates from one call to the next, you only need to use the button OK to put the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found and set with the displayed map. select the region and zoom in. choose the region and enlarge it again and again until you have achieved sufficient accuracy. the height must always be manually selected. the card can be switched between card mode, satellite image and mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module, there are possibilities to attach the GPS data to the pictures. here is a small script that uses the exiftool to provide a pile of pictures with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI module gallery is a tool for exporting a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums in a gallery of HTML pages to version 4.01. you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages. the character set is encoded UTF-8 to enable the best possible internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The tab has four tabs in which the settings can be adjusted. the tab selection allows you to select all the albums that are to be exported to HTML. the albums are not displayed hierarchically. with the three buttons on the right you can quickly select a large number of albums. in the area below, the album preview and the text that appear in the header of the HTML page will appear.</seg>
<seg id="824">This tab is largely self-explanatory. if you click on a picture, a new page will be created in which the image is displayed. otherwise, the image will be displayed directly with your standard image viewer, & eg; Kuickshow,</seg>
<seg id="825">The tab defines the settings where and how the gallery is to be stored with all your associated images. select a folder on which you have write permission. a subfolder named KIPIHTMLExport that contains everything will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG file format, the EXIF information of your original pictures will also be stored in the new images.</seg>
<seg id="827">With other color depth you can change the default color depth. this, of course, also influences the file size. all other settings are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="828">The thumbnails will allow you to customize some of the settings from the album tab for thumbnails, which are small images that are displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window indicates the user how far the action is. press Cancel to cancel the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">If the module has created the pages, the window will not be closed automatically. you can therefore read the programs to determine if errors occurred during production. the web browser will automatically start at the end to preview the gallery. press Close to close the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI Image viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL-based tool to view images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI picture viewer allows you to view a selection of pictures and to perform basic operations such as rotations, zooming or shifting. the viewer can be used with shortcomings and pastes. he has been developed for quick image display and quick access to his functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After the start, a picture is displayed in full screen mode by default. this can be changed to a window mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG Lossless Module is a tool for changing images without affecting your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions below, without the usual loss of quality or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of loss-free storage is that the file size increases as no compression of the color information takes place. for example, this can also be found in PNG format.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI digital camera client is a tool for connecting your computer to a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI module digital camera client currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Please note: the participants in this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The KIPI module metadata editor currently has no documentation. if you want to change this situation, please contact kde-imaging @ kde.org of the KIPI team.</seg>
<seg id="840">With the Import function of the metadata module, you can copy data from one image to another. then select the image you want to copy in the main program and then call the Import function. this then opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image, so the image to which you want to copy the metadata.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere, but not write into any target format. JPEG is supported in writing. please look at exiv2 to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG encoding module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG encoding module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video with a defined length. this module uses the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages. you can also add an audio file in the MP2 or WAV of the slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are automatically scaled to the correct size for the selected video format. additionally, you can select a background color for slide show. with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. to burn the medium you can finally use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">First you need to select the images to be packed into the MPEG slide show. after that, you can create the module via Tools MPEG Slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images you selected are then listed under image files in the portfolio. there you can also change sorting of the images or the contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should adjust the other settings. the video format can be selected from various formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you plan to play the file on a TV, you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is default and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step, you should specify the time in seconds that will display a picture. the speed of the image transition is specified below. a low value generates very sudden, a high, very smooth image change.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in doubt, you should let it black. the name and path of the generated file can be set in the Name of the MPEG output file.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file in the name of the audio source file, it will be integrated into the movie. once you have adapted all the settings to your wishes, you can use the encoding button to start generating the movie. depending on the speed of your computer, you can now go to a coffee quickly or in peace and enjoy the slideshow when you are back.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a note appears that encoders or tools are missing, you can customize the paths to the programs of the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages via the Settings link at the bottom.</seg>
<seg id="852">The Printer Wizard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes. the combined images can also be opened automatically with the image image Gimp. this is e.g: useful to improve or print with the Gimp module for direct printing.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format into one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command line tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. an original quote from him is: do not expect from dcraw that it generates the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer. sometimes you get with dcraw better results!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the RAW file to be converted and start the module. the Raw Image Converter window will then appear in the mode for a single image. with the Preview button you can view the effect of your current settings on the image.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option decides if the camera settings are to be used for the white balance. the main parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amps can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can edit the image later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected to allow you to use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are happy with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. the file name stays the same and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossless algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">The Tagged Image Format, TIFF, retains all the information of your image and uses the lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you plan to edit your pictures frequently or later reuse them later, you should not choose the JPEG format, since it only allows a limited number of operations before worsening the image quality. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you select JPEG as a storage format, the metadata that is contained in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the Exif information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adjusted your settings, you can start the conversion with the Run button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="863">The batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at once. therefore, use this mode if you are sure, e.g. by testing on a single image, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for single images. however, they have the possibility to overwrite existing files automatically. however, this is useful if they were created in an earlier attempt. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar shows how far the conversion has progressed.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all images in an album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all images of an album. you can set the prefix, the score and the timestamp of the album.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of multiple images of an image collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package.</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in one dimension. the width or height of the image is selected automatically, depending on the image orientation. the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): resizing in two dimensions. here, the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option e.g. to customize your image to screen size.</seg>
<seg id="870">Nonproportional size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed with this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Printing Preparation: prepares the image for the photo print. the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photo paper. the target image, including background size, edge size and background color, is adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected pictures with your preferred e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the pictures appearing before.</seg>
<seg id="873">After which you started the module, the pictures window will be shown with the pictures you selected. you can add more images with a file selection dialog. for the last selected image a preview is displayed on the right.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag and drop images to the picture list to add the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="875">With the Copy button the selected pictures will be removed from the list of pictures to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="876">After you have selected all the images you can open the New Message window of your e-mail client with the OK button. you only have to add the addresses and the subject. the pictures you have selected are attached as attachments.</seg>
<seg id="877">Make sure not to send too many pictures at once. most email accounts have restrictions on the size of emails to be sent. it may be a good idea to send multiple emails when you want to send many pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window is used to change the settings for sending images. your configuration is saved and used every time until you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your email client from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you must specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google Mail Service, you must first install the Gmail Agent on your computer. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After selecting comments in a attached file, comments on the images are added to a text file and sent to the mail.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format under the File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted to lossless formats such as TIFF. therefore, you should use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise we recommend the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG in JPEG format and are the original files in JPEG format, then the original Exiifdata will be added to the pictures to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is ready, the window will not be closed automatically so you can view the status notifications, searching for errors, but your e-mail program will be started automatically at the end.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the module Advanced Diaschau a window with questions like you want to show your slideshow appear. you can choose between the albums you selected and all the pictures of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The OpenGL Output option in the presentation enables very elegant image transitions by OpenGL. however, you need to have a corresponding graphic card, otherwise the slide show will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The Display file name indicates that the filename of the images will be shown in the left lower corner during the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The loop option ensures that the presentation is displayed in a loop. you can then manually interrupt it with Esc.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option of selecting images randomly ensures that the images are displayed in a random order. thus, the order of the images is not used in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">The distance between the pictures can be set between the pictures. 1500 milliseconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transition effect. so you should check this before you show your friends!</seg>
<seg id="891">There are over a dozen transition effects between which you can select. randomly, any transition between images selects another effect.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the slideshow you can access a toolbar at the top left edge of the screen. move the mouse into this corner around you.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this toolbar you can stop the presentation and start again, jump to the previous and the next image and stop the slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="894">At the left lower edge of the screen you can see the current filename, the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module Time & Date has no documentation yet. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Please note: the participants in this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module background image is a tool for placing an image as background image for the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module sets the currently selected image, depending on the selected option of the sub-menu, as a background for your KDE desktop.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have finished your pictures and videos with annotations, you can use & kphotoalbum; Browse through these, see picture. as you can see through a comparison with the image, now in each group, so in persons, places and in the group keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window, you will see the categories for which you entered information when you provided your images and videos with annotations. additionally, there are entries to look for EXIF-based information, view the folder structure on your hard disk and of course view the current preview images.</seg>
<seg id="900">If you press the mouse over the entry, the view of the browser changes. see the image.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you select another person only the images on which both persons can be seen. using this selection method, you can limit the number of images displayed by a few thousand images to a few single images.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all the people, locations and other settings, you can view thumbnails to view the images in your area of action.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture every person has the same icon in front of her name. you can use a & kphotoalbum; however, for each person you can save your own thumbnail, which of course also applies to locations, keywords and other categories you have defined.</seg>
<seg id="904">To display pictures in addition to the names, select the button located on the right side of the toolbar. in the appearing context menu, you can select which view you want to use for each category. this has the advantage that you can view, for example, symbols with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords (if you don't have the right images for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">However, you have to choose which image to display for each individual. to do this, you will need to open the image view window (in more detail) and select the item Editor's entry in the context menu. now, you can customize the image for the respective person. in the view window, you can customize the magnification factor according to your wishes and select which portion of the image should be displayed or cut off.</seg>
<seg id="906">When you access the search in the main window, a dialog appears that is very similar to the dialog for setting the picture properties. you can view this dialog once more on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a string in the Label or Description field, you can also enter a date to search for; the date can be either a part of the total date, i.e., for example 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two data, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options at the bottom of the window you can search all the images according to specific names as you can see in the picture. here is shown according to images on which Jesper, but not Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user manual for & photoalbum;. if you don't like to read manuals, but prefer to try out functions, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the homepage of & kphotoalbum; and watch the quick entry, the screenshots and the introduction videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & kphotoalbum; and in the first dialog, select the demo, in case you start & photoalbum; for the first time, or choose the menu entry kphotoalbum; demo. then, some sample images will be loaded and you can try the functions of & photoalbum; try.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this manual, find it on the homepage of & kphotoalbum; as a coherent HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & kphotoalbum; view the timeline. a picture of this bar can be seen here:. as the name suggests, this bar displays you data statistics on the images in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The timeline can display several different time units. each bar then displays a different unit. you can switch between the units years, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database by displaying the bar only 10 minute sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline can be used interactively in the following ways: you can change the displayed entries preview view from the database (when you select a date, the first image will display this date in the preview window) and also the timeline displays the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in the preview view.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select a section of timeline by holding down the mouse button and dragging the mouse over the ruler of time bar, so the time data. if you select an area, you will only see images of this period in the preview view. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a timeline bar.</seg>
<seg id="917">& kphotoalbum; provides you with two options available to create HTML websites with your pictures. the one is in & kphotoalbum; integrated and the other available as module (see). in the following part of the user manual is described in & kphotoalbum; integrated version, which you can create via the menu File HTML...</seg>
<seg id="918">Before creating HTML pages, you will need to make some settings. these are divided into the three areas content, layout and target. in the following, each area is described more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the title and a description that will contain the HTML file later on. on kphotoalbum; HTML example pages will see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next select whether a & kphotoalbum; -Export file is to be created which is to be seen on the overview page. you will find more information about the export files in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Finally, you can select which information to display on the HTML pages. this allows you to avoid that information is displayed, which are obvious to the viewer without a description. for example, all images are from a party. note that & kphotoalbum; currently all images are exported. therefore, you can not use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this section you can define how the HTML pages are to look like. most settings are unique, which is why they are not specifically addressed.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page you can set up different resolutions for the images. thus, those who look at your website and have a monitor supporting the maximum resolution 800x600, do not download images, which for example have a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewers of your site can change the resolution at any time you specified. so you can search your images with low resolution, leading to a lower transmission time. if you want to see a larger image larger, it changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting, you specify the different folders and the URL where your site is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">The best way to select a root folder for all your HTML files and a new subfolder for each subsequent set.</seg>
<seg id="927">First you need to select the main folder in which all your images will be saved. this folder will be saved and added automatically next time. this allows you to select the location for all future images. here you can select either a folder or a protocol supported by KDE, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After creating your images, you can check that they are really all visible to viewers. if you select a URL for the base folder, a web browser after the pages have been created, will start. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder, you need to manually copy them there. to enable the import function, see, properly you need to specify the final destination of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base folder in which all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The settings that have just been described have changed all three to base folders and URLs. in them, a subfolder is created, whose name you specify in the output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are on a family celebration, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & photoalbum; together, you might want to create an HTML page for viewing the pictures. however, if you have spent a lot of time applying the image information, people on the pictures, recording location, etc. then you have to do with & kphotoalbum; this work will not do this one more time.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kphotoalbum; you can export a copy of your images into a .kim file. these can import others into your database. the image properties are imported with ex- and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or if there is only one link to images in the file. the advantage of saving all images into the file is that you have all the images together and that this file can pass so independently. however, the obvious downside is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can either exporting a .kim file directly from the File menu... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file together with an HTML file, this will be an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file scans the images in two ways. first, it scans the images that are located in the .kim file. if the corresponding pictures are not found, the images of the URL you specify when creating the HTML files are searched. this is of course only possible if you have created your .kim file using HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">The following is a dialog for exporting images, which you can view via the File Export menu...</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .kim files. the following three choices are available:</seg>
<seg id="938">You need to copy the images in the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">Copy & kphotoalbum automatically to the .kim file with the option Automatically close the .kim file; the images automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal zip files. as most images have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, it's usually not worth compressing the files. if you want this anyway, simply select the Export file option.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is to limit the maximum image size. if you send pictures to your friends, you might not want to send the pictures in full size, because the .kim file would otherwise be very large. for example, you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you import a file with the suffix .kim from the web browser or from the File menu... select, & kphotoalbum; the exported database as described in it.</seg>
<seg id="943">The Import Wizard consists of four steps. first you need to select which images you want to import, then in which folders the import images should be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It can be that you are the category people of the file to be imported (if you are a domain) while this category is called people. therefore, in the third dialogue window, you will be asked which categories of the file to be imported, and which categories these are in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database. an example of this can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It has to be easy to browse and view images: if you see pictures, you often want to jump within different picture groups & mdash; for example, if you see pictures of your Italy vacation and discover a picture with your friend on it, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is pictured.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual, you will go through the various steps of (1) establishing information about your images, about (2) browsing and watching, up to (3) advanced themes and customization options.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoAlbum has been started as a program for managing your pictures. however, it has been expanded and today it also takes care of your videos. in many places in this manual is talked about pictures, but often this also includes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& kphotoalbum; saves all its information in the index.xml file in the top folder of your images. this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice, e.g. normal backup tools, copy to a disk or revisions in CVS, where you want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kphotoalbum; remembers the folder in which your images are stored and automatically use it again in future starts. if you want to read another folder tree with pictures, you can start & kphotoalbum; with the -c option. as an example: kphotoalbum -c ~ / company / Pictures / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Via the menu entry settings kphotoalbum; set up... you can get to a window with which you can modify the settings of & kphotoalbum; in the following section of the User Manual the various settings are explained.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you can see six different symbols that allow you to preview and view the options for the viewer. for each setting there is a detailed help available which can be accessed by pressing the F1 key and clicking on the option you want.</seg>
<seg id="953">It describes how you can set different properties for each picture, e.g. people, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">See the dialog used to edit existing groups. for each existing group you can select a label and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section, sub-categories have already been mentioned. in the Options dialog you can set up complete member groups, i.e., for example, all members of a group at once in a group rather than all groups of a member as explained in.</seg>
<seg id="956">In the selection list above you can select the category you want to configure. in the left part of the window is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub-categories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kphotoalbum; shares its modular system with other graphics applications, such as digiKam and Gwenview. this module system is called KIPI and means & kde; image plugin interface.</seg>
<seg id="958">Modules can and will not be described in this manual as they are not part of & kphotoalbum; however, most modules have a help page that you can access via the module itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules are used together by multiple applications each other, it may be that the modules with a & kphotoalbum; only very little tested. therefore, you should always test new modules with the demo database before using them with the command &gt; kphotoalbum -demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the menu Help. don't say I would not have warned you!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that use the modules via KIPI are very different, making it possible that some modules with & K-photoalbum; do not work. this is the disadvantage if you share functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & photoalbum; and other applications that use KIPI is that the other applications will arrange their images in albums: an album is simply a folder. even if & photoalbum; this kind of order does not support, it simulates the order after albums for some modules, so that you can use the functions with a photoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="962">Previewing & photoalbum; the current album, which simply corresponds to the current view, so all the images that the picture preview currently shows.</seg>
<seg id="963">In addition to the current album, & kphotoalbum; the modules also have a list of albums. here is a photoalbum, as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & kphotoalbum; s browser displays the content of a category, for example all persons, then each entry of this category represents an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will use the category you have set in the Settings dialog as a category for virtual albums. so if you use the category people for example, it will do & kphotoalbum; so do, so whether you have selected persons to view and share it with the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & kphotoalbum are not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. then start the setup dialog and select modules which want to load modules.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start & photoalbum; start with your own imagery.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used by any other KDE application, you can see a menu and toolbar at the top. under the toolbar, you will see the window that you can browse your image database. in the section we will return to this window, but click on the picture to show you an overview of all available pictures.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & photoalbum; it is possible to provide any image with annotations. this includes information about the persons who are shown on the picture, etc. you can set any picture individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time. if, for example, is illustrated on all pictures of Jesper and all pictures taken in Copenhagen are included.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these comments can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section. if you want you can see these comments if you are using the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">See three lists with a text box by setting people, locations and keywords. these are a very important part of & kphotoalbum; as you can use them again and again when you type information about your images.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is to postpone the images in the list: for example, if you have a family celebration and the same 5-10 persons are shown on all 50 pictures, you can, by the fact that the names used are moved up, find the people faster and arrange them.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to get an alphabetically sorted list, click on the Sorting button below the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected annotations for each image individually, you may want to edit all the selected images and add these images with annotations. in this case, simply click the front and back buttons, which are located below the thumbnail on the upper right corner.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have added several images, e.g. with the same person, it can be more convenient to mark all these images and to use the menu item Several entries at once with a comment.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA. San Francisco and Los Angeles are also located in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">In the picture you see a browser window that shows the USA as an over group. to show you that it is an over group, a special symbol is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the Comment dialog's context menu it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new one or sub-category. in addition, you can also drag an entry into a category and drop it there to make it subcategory of this entry. note, this presupposes that you just sort your categories alphabetically.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and dragging the bars forming the top edge of the frame. you can also make a separate window from a frame by dragging it outside the window area.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adjusted the appearance of the window so to your needs that you are satisfied with the settings, click the Options button... which offers among other things the possibility to store the current structure and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also completely hide a frame. if you want to see this window again later, use the Options button... and then window / hide window. this is shown in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you choose to display images in your browser, you will get an overview of preview images of the currently selected images, or all images if you do not have a filter. an example of this can be seen here. you can configure the size of thumbnails by simply dragging the mouse with the middle mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you drop an image on the background of your desktop, this image will be set as wallpaper for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on a picture, it will be displayed in the picture viewer. if you have not opened a window with a picture viewer, a new window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete pictures in the preview pane. simply select the corresponding pictures you want to delete and press either the Remove button or select Delete from the Edit menu. now the window will appear that you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& kphotoalbum; provides you with a solution for this problem. you can use a & kphotoalbum, namely images, without saving you to the hard drive. of course you need to store the images somewhere, so that & kphotoalbum; you can view the view of & kphotoalbum; if not all required images can be downloaded from the hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="987">Images in which the right upper corner is cut off are not stored on the hard drive. for example, the thumbnails are available, so & kphotoalbum; you can view the preview of these images. however, you can not view these images with the image viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you see, this function requires you to copy files from the folders and then copy it back into. & kphotoalbum; so if you want to avoid annoying how to avoid merging your images, please buy a larger hard disk to store all images on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the Pictures menu you will find a sub-menu with the name privacy. if you want to have a little more privacy, filter the images in such a way that at the end there are those who wish to make you inaccessible for others and click the Current View menu in the privacy menu. alternatively, you can also control all the pictures that your little sister can see, and choose the menu entry All except current view.</seg>
<seg id="990">With this, you have specified which images should be hidden in the case of the case. if you now give the laptop to your little sister, simply select the menu entry Add images, so that all the images you have locked can be hidden. if you want to get the pictures again displayed, click Unlock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to specify a password which must be entered to unlock the images. to set up this password, simply choose password in the privacy menu.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please bear in mind that this picture-protection is by no means very secure. on the one hand, all images on the hard drive and on the other can read or delete the password as unencrypted text. this type of password protection is only for those who use a & kphotoalbum; not very familiar to forbid the view of private pictures.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason you spend all your pictures with & photoalbum; manage and spend hours over hours with it is natural that you want to view them at some point. for this reason & photoalbum has an image _ and video viewer. you can start it from the preview as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">You can see the viewer in the picture. of course it shows the picture, but additional all the information you have entered the picture, such as who is on the picture, when and where it was made, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the info box on the upper part of the image you want to see, you can easily drag them with the mouse and discard somewhere else. you can also configure which information is displayed and whether any information should be displayed at all. all these options are available right click on the viewer.</seg>
<seg id="996">If you click on Anne Helene, the browser will show you all the pictures of Anne Helene. as if you had selected persons from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have multiple images loaded in the viewer, you can switch between them before and after by using the buttons image high and down. you can jump to the first and last image with Pos1 and the end. these functions can also be reached from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If multiple images are loaded in the viewer, you can run them as slide show. & kphotoalbum; then load a new image after a few seconds. how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing Ctrl key and plus or minus. started and stopped the slide show by pressing Ctrl; S.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful feature of the viewer from & kphotoalbum; is it able to switch to full screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the full screen on the screen. just use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">If you use the viewer you can zoom in and zoom in. to zoom in, you can simply drag a rectangle with the mouse. with the minus key, you can zooming out in the middle of the image. shows how a zoom-rectangle is selected and displays the result of the zooms.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the dot key, you can reset your zoom so that the image is not zoomed. with the unit key, zooms, so that every pixel on the screen matches a pixel of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoom-operations that work with videos that are in and out with the plus and minus key are.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the functions from the context menu you can rotate the image. this does not work for videos. you can make comments to the current image with the menu item notes from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you look at pictures it may happen that you can find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture. at the moment you can view the Cancel and Configuration dialog of the image to enter those names. however, you might prefer to select only the image and view more pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the images developed on paper. to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the images and mark them as good or bad as you look at one by one.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer gives you the possibility to tag pictures with features while you view them. characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can put a mark in that you press the corresponding letter. in, you see a picture where characteristics A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">As soon as you have attributes to your pictures, you can see them in your browser. so if you have all the images you edit, print or whatever you have selected, just add them all at once with annotations. then you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features can be displayed in preview view. if you display categories in the particular preview, then you can add features to the images by simply clicking the character for the attribute after the image was selected. you can see this:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture. in this case, you allow & photoalbum; to paint on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The batch is not stored with the image, but in the database. in this way, you can undo your painted later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In order to enable the painting mode of & kphotoalbum; switch on the painting from the context menu. to finish the painting simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To work with & kpovmodeler; you need to use the program & Povray; not fully control, but the documentation to & Povray; should you have read and understood.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree you can select individual objects. then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is shown in the wire model views yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects simultaneously. but not the object of an already selected object, since all sub-objects are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object into the object tree, select the position on which you want to insert the object and click either on the toolbar icon or select a menu item in the Insert menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are several possible positions, the following drop-down menu is displayed to enable you to select the correct position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">You can delete selected objects from the scene by deleting either from the menu bar under Edit or from the right mouse button context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have changed properties, click Apply to take these changes. if you have entered invalid values, a message will be displayed with an error description. then you can correct the input errors and then click Apply or discard the changes with Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="1019">If you enter the path to & Povray; -user documentation in the Setup dialog, you can call the & Povray; -Reference to the displayed object.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this feature. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 already contains the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">When you edit a texture or part of a texture you can see a preview in the property view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press Preview in the properties view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture. as default the whole texture is rendered, even if you want to render a subset item. if you want to render just a part of the texture (for example a texture inside a texture map and not the entire texture map), tick the locally.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screen shot shows the control points of the camera. you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is selected, the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view. this cross marks the center for scaling and rotation as well as the position for shifts. you can change the shift by dragging with the mouse inside the entire window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a level of visibility as a wire model. you can specify this value relative to the level of visibility of the parent object or as absolute value. objects are displayed only when they are selected or their level of visibility is smaller or equal to the level of visibility selected in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window arrangement as default. the object tree and the view of the object properties are displayed left and the four graphical views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the standard window arrangement or if you need a different arrangement, you can set it as you like. you can also store multiple window arrangements and simply switch between different configurations.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window over or below a present view, drag the switch to the top or bottom of a view. a rectangle then displays the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the tracker to the right or left side of a view. the new view will then be anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to arrange multiple views over one another, drag the Anfasser in the middle of another view. you can then switch between the views by clicking on the map leader at the top of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window arrangement are floating views: views that are not anchored in the main window. to solve a view from anchoring, drag the Anfasser on the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing left in the interface bar.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view, click on the small cross in the fascia bar. to prevent the closing, click on the small square between the arrow and the cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can insert additional views into the main window. in the View menu, you will find entries for any kind of views. new views are floating, you can anchor them at any location.</seg>
<seg id="1034">The current window view allows you to save the window arrangement... store it. a dialog is displayed where you can save the window arrangement under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene, you can render them. & kpovmodeler; used & Povray; 3.1g for rendering, this program must be properly installed. as this manual was written, & Povray; 3.5 date. this version is in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0 does not support.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene, click on the Rendering icon Rendering icon in the toolbar or select View Scene menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A rendering mode corresponds to the entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and the quality of rendering. if you want to render a scene in different frame sizes and quality levels, you can insert any number of render modes, from a quick preview to full images of the highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar, or select Render Modi on the View menu, the following dialog will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each render mode has a name. you can enter any name, but useful is a name that lets you recognize the properties of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the map size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image. if you want to render only a small area of the image, select the check box subsection and enter the image excerpt for rendering to the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In the combination field quality you can select the properties, the & Povray; used for rendering. this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex-diffuser retro-illumination. a detailed description of the rendering features can be found in the user manual for & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture is rendered with only one ray per pixel, various errors can arise. these images often have a Moirè pattern or step effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than one pixel in the representation.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the impact of these errors. generally, pictures with this feature are better off.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you switch on anti-aliasing, computes and links & Povray; more than one ray per pixel. this technique means super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. the default is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptively because the super-sampling is the adjacent pixels with one. the second method is adaptive-recursive; recursively because each pixel is separated again and again and adaptively because the recursion depth depends on the calculated color values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method, POV-Ray pursues a ray per pixel. if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels crosses the specified threshold, then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you set the depth value to 4, a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated, with a depth value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional rays each pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: r 1, g 1 and b 1 the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays each pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold, then the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixels, which are separately pursued and tested for further subdivision. the maximum depth of recursion can be adjusted with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the production of noise for the jet process called Jittering. if you turn on Jittering, changed & Povray; the beams around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The final setting for the quality of the render is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental feature of & Povray; which calculates diffuse light reflection. it takes very long to let a scene compute with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map you can adjust whether the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is transparent if the associated beams have no object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for the Povray display; console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly finished, you can find the reason for it here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray, select the Import menu entry... and select a file in the dialog box.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently, & kpovmodeler does not support the full command set by & Povray; if error messages or warnings occur when importing, a dialog window displays a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you don't want to support source code in & kpovmodeler; importing, write this source code between the two special comments / / * PMRwBegin and / / * PMRwEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from the object tree into the editor to export the source text for & Povray. this adds the source code of the object into the open text file in the editor. to import objects into the scene, simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copy and paste in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can paste source code for & Povray; also.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovModeler; a scene rendered. usually this is povray or x-povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on Help in the property view, opens & kpovmodeler; the & Povray; user documentation on the displayed object. here the path to your document is supported and the version is supported. versions 3.1g and 3.5 will be supported.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (for example height-field data) in paths to the & Povray; libraries. if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene, you also need to enter the path to these files here. if a file appears in different paths of the library, the first found file is used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The color for the wire models. the second color is used for displaying the selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for the control points. the second color is used to display the selected control points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type labels.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the object catch of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views. you can here set the grid separately for shifts, scaling and rotations.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values make a more accurate wire model and thus a better approximation for the displayed objects, but require more time to render. for some objects such as the ball, you can set the detail level separately for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">When you tick the High level of detail for extended projections, all wire model views are further divided if the camera uses an extended projection. extended projections are all projections with exceptions of perspective and vertical projections. this feature results in better approximation for projections, but requires more time to render.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you tick wall, a wall behind the objects is rendered. the wall is represented in a chess board pattern consisting of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you tick the bottom, a floor below the objects is rendered. the floor is represented in a chess board pattern consisting of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you tick the edge smoothing option, the non-recursive anti-aliasing method is used for rendering the scenes. you can set the values for depth and threshold values in the Render-Modi section.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can change existing Window arrangements or create new window arrangements. in the Window Environment section it is explained how you can create and save windows orders.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The combination panel Standard window arrangement: displays all available window arrangements. & kpovmodeler; uses the selected window arrangement when starting the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list Existing Window arrangements shows all available window arrangements. a new arrangement allows you to create with the Add button and delete a select configuration with the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Each window arrangement is identified by the name. the name must be unique and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list below the name displays all views for the selected window arrangement. new views can be created with the Add button and Delete selected views with the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The new column allows you to create a new column on the right side of the existing windows, with Unten you will anchor the window under the existing window, with flash card you will receive a map view together with the previous view and floating suspended the view not in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you just have & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installs and now you want to start without exact knowledge of both programs. if you follow all steps in this guide, you should create the ultimate but simple scene, among beginners very popular: a sphere at one level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should observe the following warnings before you complain that as a result you only get a black screen. if you use a 3D program for the first time, you should follow these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you do not set a camera, no rules for rendering can be applied, as a result you will get a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you do not insert light sources, your entire scene is in the dark and you only get a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have installed everything without errors, see the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following pre-set window arrangement:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing symbols of the toolbar. please read the documentation so that you get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and symbols right now, so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">To follow this guide, first you have to remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select the Edit menu item, so you now have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire model view shows how the camera looks at the whole scene you generate. in particular, you notice that in the fourth wire model view (right below). this is the view of the scene from the perspective of the camera. this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry called camera. when you click on it, you can see the contents of the object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found. in the user documentation of & Povray; for further details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change the basic settings of the camera, this is reserved for later instructions, but note that the camera has control points with which you can change the point of view of the camera. simply click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="1088">Pressing the button or pressing the Enter key will immediately change the wire model views and the object tree according to these settings. as a result, you will see the scene from the camera's point of view.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the ground for the scene. you might, for example, insert a box (inserting finite bodies) and the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a convenient method to solve this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; it actually provides a simpler way. you can use an infinite plane as a base:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the layer in the object tree, change the name and press the Apply button or enter the Enter key. in the Object Tree the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire model view now shows the level as well, although at the moment only as a finite ending level. if you render the scene, the plane extends to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">When you look at the object tree exactly, you will notice that you can fold the item for the floor when you click on the symbol + in front of the object. in this case, you will only see the default options for each new object: scaling, rotation, and shift.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene, you should move the floor to the exercise unit under the horizontal line just to get to know some of these parameters. select Shift and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First select the floor to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but select something simple at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases a dialog opens, in which you can choose how the object should be inserted. please select First object. the pigment will then be displayed in the property tree. you can change the name in the property view (name = bottom-pigment), with a click on the Preview button you will see how the pigment looks now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the pigments preview only shows a matt black material because you still need to check the pigments for the pigments. please always remember that you can preview the look of materials at any time by clicking on the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't see a color on the headers and the ball in the preview, just click on the Apply button and then click the Preview button.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now set correctly. if you render your image now with a click on the symbol, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">In the color list you have to enter two new attributes, called Unicoloured. in the object tree you have to enter the entry color list. then edit this entry twice (you can do this more often, but the chessboard color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In the object tree always select monochrome and change the colors in the view of the object properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">This step you should already be able to do, since you should have already understood the basic working method of & kpovModeler; the ball can be easily created just as easily as the ground:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object properties you can immediately change the settings. set the value for the radius: on 1 (do not forget to press the input button or the knob user), so the sphere has contact with the ground. otherwise, the sphere would float above the ground as you have shifted the ground around one unit downwards.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course the rendering now results in a strange result: as already seen before, the ball surface appears like a matt black material. in the following step, put a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the ball, you can now assign a material to it. as already with the ground, give the ball a pigment as color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select First object and change the name for example in Ball Pigment. click on the Pigment button, then select Unicoloured and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some Finish Properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as shown in the following screenshots and click Apply or press the Enter key.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The brightness effect and reflection already result in good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed surfaces even when metallic: not yet selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of what options are available to you & kpovModeler; hopefully you have already learnt so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracycing is a rendering method to create a two dimensional picture of a three-dimensional scene or model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">When you raytracing a scene, the rendering of hypothetical rays moves from the viewer's perspective (i.e. from the camera, rendering the scenes) through each pixel in the scene. the render calculates how this ray is reflected by the objects and how atmospheric effects such as fog can affect.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you won't see anything without a camera, the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene. without a light source, you don't see anything, the picture is simply black. obviously, every scene needs to be rendered, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog, you can select your file. Povray files usually have the extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the default file dialog, you can select a file you have previously created with & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open or create a new model, the file will be inserted into this sub-menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have already saved the model, it will be stored in the same name. if it is a new file, you will need to enter a name and a disk space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Restores the scene in the last saved version. all changes since the last storage has been discarded.</seg>
<seg id="1119">This menu entry can only be selected if you have not already saved any changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the last executed command. this menu entry can only be selected if you have used Edit back.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Saves the current window arrangement and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or overwrite an existing layout.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you will find options for setting & kpovmodeler; here you can change the look, shortcut and default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog to change keyboard shortcuts. you can use this option to set default short commands for & kpovmodeler; change commands or add new ones.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog to set up the toolbar. you can use this option to add and remove tool icons for & kpovmodeler; commands.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A Bump-Map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to model any bump on the surface individually and to change without the geometrical shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file for both a bump map and a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic elements are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are created out of dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies. these models are then further machined to give them a more realistic look.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel basis using an image file as a color card.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuokickshow; is a comfortable image viewer and browser. the application has a file browser in which you can select images to view.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">Use of & kuokickshow; is very simple. the file browser lists files that you can use with clicks of the & LMBn; or the Return key.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can specify whether each image should be displayed in a separate window, or whether all images should always use the same window.</seg>
<seg id="1133">If you are looking for a specific file, simply type the first character of the filename in the browser window. then a small input field appears in the right lower corner. if a matching file name has been found, the file will be highlighted. you can exit the input field by pressing Return or Esc.</seg>
<seg id="1134">In the Setting & kuokickshow dialog, there are five cards. in three of them, General and Edit and Slide Show, you can set the working method of & kuokickshow; in the other two, short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser, the keyboard shortcuts can be specified for the respective windows.</seg>
<seg id="1135">If this is selected, the images will be opened in full screen mode. if the image is not large enough to fill the screen, the rest of the display surface is filled with the background color you can adjust further down. presetting is not fullscreen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1136">This point is activated, loads & kuokickshow; already the next image in the folder, while you still watch the current picture. this reduces the delay if you choose the next image, and is particularly suitable for a slideshow.</seg>

Select.</seg>
<seg id="1182">You may need to set existing multimedia keys to work as & Amarok; -Shortcuts. this way you can make your keyboard to the & Amarok; control center.</seg>
<seg id="1183">Amarok's DCOP interface has many general functions, most of which can be found in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the DCOP features of collection, context browsers, players, playlists, playlists browsers and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports the command-line options from Qt and & kde; in addition, Amarok has some own command-line options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a lack of dependencies. please check in your script if all required modules are available and use a checkbox to allow the user to know why a script does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Begin require 'Korundum' rescue LoadError error = 'Korundum (KDE bindings for ruby) from kdebindings V3.4 is required for this script.' 'kdialog --sorry' # {error} '' exit end</seg>
<seg id="1187">In the scripts / templates folder you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use them as the base for your own scripts or simply add them to the required functions. you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively easy.</seg>
<seg id="1188">Using DCOP, your scripts can exchange data with Amarok and control Amarok. the easiest way is to use the dcop command, which should be included in any KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripting languages are used to execute external programs and commands. for this, the function exec () is usually used. in this way, dcop &gt; can be invoked relatively easily. here is an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& Amarok; sends messages to all running scripts. for this purpose, scripts should be written to the standard input of the script. for this reason, scripts should constantly monitor their standard input and react accordingly to events. of course, a script may also ignore events when there is no use for it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure sets the script to display the setup dialog. in order to save and store the setup data, each script must take care of itself. when a script is started, Amarok sets the working folder to the folder where all data should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange signals that a new piece is played. the script could now ask for more information about the new piece using DCOP functions (for example the metadata or the piece length).</seg>
<seg id="1193">VolumeChange newVolume signalizes a change in volume. the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">CustomMenuClicked: submenu itemTitle paths includes the path to the selected files of the playlist, if a custom menu entry is clicked. to add an entry, you can use dcop Amarok script addCustomMinuItem (Submenu itemTitle). to remove an entry, use dcop Amarok script removeCustomMinuItem (Submenu itemTitle).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & Amarok; terminates, or when the user stops a script, sends & Amarok; the signal SIGTERM to the script. this signal should be processed, for example, to perform clean-up operations, such as saving data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks script management can also install scripts that the user & zb has downloaded from a web server. such packages are basically normal Tar archives (.tar), which can optionally also be compressed with bzip2 (.bz2).</seg>
<seg id="1197">& Amarok; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the creation of amaroscript. for this reason, you should correctly name your script packages right away.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main script must be executable (+ x), the remaining modules should not be executable. use the Tar parameter -p to get the file permissions:</seg>
<seg id="1199">When your script package is ready, you can upload it to www.kde-apps.org and attach the link to the Wiki script page of & Amarok; for your entry on kde-apps you should use the category Amarok; scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1200">& Amarok; is an audio player for & kde;. & Amarok; has many useful and powerful features and is still surprisingly easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1201">With & Amarok; you can simply drag music into the playlist instead of having to work through endless menus. you may also search for a very specific title from thousands in your collection. with & Amarok; 's Collecting Browser and Quick Search you will find the piece within seconds.</seg>
<seg id="1202">You might have already some playlists, but can never decide which ones you want to hear? then the playlist browser is exactly the right thing for you. and if the decision is still difficult, the dynamic mode and the smart playlists automatically select the right music according to specific criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1203">Amarok has excellent support for Apple's iPod, iRivers ifp and many generic USB devices. besides, many different audio systems can be used, so YOU can choose how you want to listen to your music.

<seg id="1217">Relative paths for manually stored playlists: when you enable this setting, & Amarok; relative paths to music files, starting from the location of the playlist. otherwise, the absolute position of music files is stored.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Keep up-to-date pieces visible during play changes, so that the playlist window will pop up / off to keep the running piece always in the visible window area.</seg>
<seg id="1219">Changing to context browsers automatically indicates the context browser as soon as the next piece is played.</seg>
<seg id="1220">In the Appearance section, you can customize & Amarok; s Appearance. the section is subdivided into three parts.</seg>
<seg id="1221">In the fonts section, you can set the use of different fonts in & Amarok; by selecting Properties fonts, the otherwise gray shown section will be enabled. you can select Writing for the following range: playlist Window, Player Window and Context Browser. click Select..., so you can select a font from the selection dialog.</seg>

<seg id="1224">Set the On-Screen Display window allows you to switch on the OSD. if on-screen display is used, a preview of the OSD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly.</seg>
<seg id="1225">The first option is the font. click Select... to select the font for the OSD from the dialog. the check box shadow causes the text to be shaded in the OSD.</seg>
<seg id="1226">Using your own colors gives you the option to customize the OSD color for font and background. clicking on the color surfaces opens the dialog for color selections. if the colors are not activated, the default colors will be used.</seg>
<seg id="1227">The Display Text input field displays the text displayed in the OSD. by entering wildcards, the OSD can be adjusted to your needs. below is a list of available space holders and what they mean.</seg>
<seg id="1228">The screen option is intended for Xinama users. this allows you to specify which screen of a multi-monitor environment the OSD is to appear.</seg>
<seg id="1229">The card card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop-down box. some drivers also activate other settings in this card card.</seg>
<seg id="1230">The card collection is used to set all settings for your collection. this includes the folder and the type of database for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1231">Here you can select the folders, the & Amarok; search for music files. to include a folder in the collection, select the check box next to its name. this section also includes check boxes to set how to proceed with the selected folders.</seg>
<seg id="1232">Browse subfolders recursively: this causes & Amarok; both those intersected as well as their subfolders will search for music.</seg>
<seg id="1233">Monitor changes: enables & Amarok; to monitor the selected folders to changes (e.g. if music files are added or deleted). in addition, an incremental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection.</seg>
<seg id="1234">Import playlists: causes & Amarok; add all found playlists to your collection folder (.pls- and .m3u files) to your collection. the automatically added playlists will appear later in the playlist browser.</seg>
<seg id="1235">The Part Collect Database is used to select a database for the collection. the combination field driver: lets you choose between SQLite or MySql. if MySql is selected, further configuration is required in the MySql subwindow.</seg>

<seg id="1242">& Amarok; is an audio player for Unix systems (such as & zb; Linux). for more information see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screenshots.</seg>
<seg id="1243">Amarok only needs the package kdelibs and no other KDE packages. you must have kdelibs thus installed (including the included programs, because & Amarok; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts). we have written a small guide on how to compile kdelibs minimal.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some features, such as the OSD, require that your window manager stops the relevant standards of freedesktop.org. Gnome will work, for example. we try to support Amarok on all platforms, therefore we use kdelibs and Qt, as these provide an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">You can locate the file by typing in ~ / .kde / share / apps / Amarok / collection _ scan.log. please report this error to the Taglib developers at bugs.kde.org and also append the broken file that caused the crash.</seg>
<seg id="1246">It is mostly because Taglib crashes when reading the meta-information from this file. please report this error to the Taglib developers at bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database, try SQLite. support for it in & Amarok; is somewhat more mature.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure that all of the libraries used by & Amarok have been compiled with the same compiler version. if, for example, Amarok; with GCC 3.4, TagLib was compiled with GCC 3.3.X, this leads to crashes when processing meta information.</seg>

<seg id="1331">& Amarok; requires the installation of some software packages. the packages required are listed below. additionally, some additional packages are listed which make work with & Amarok; more pleasant.</seg>
<seg id="1332">If you install these packages via a package management system (e.g. RPM or apt), you will also need to install the development versions of these packages!</seg>
<seg id="1333">& Amarok; it's a versatile multimedia player. it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control. like any normal multimedia player, it also has & Amarok; however, a playlist that is superior to everyone else. the playlist window contains several browsers with which you can capture and browse your entire music collection.</seg>
<seg id="1334">This chapter explains how all the functions of & Amarok will be used, including creating a collection and playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1335">The Player Window is your one-click & Amarok; control center. at the top of the window is a text display showing the current play or current stream. directly below is the area, the playing time, bit rate and sample rate of the current play. a click on this area changes the display of the already expired playing time for the remaining play time of the play.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In addition, the Player window contains a selection of audio analyzers, even under the text display. you can switch by the available analyzer by clicking the left mouse button on the pane.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The & Amarok; Analyzer can be separated from the player window. press on your keyboard and the current Analyzer will be displayed in an independent, magnifying window.</seg>
<seg id="1338">The PL and EQ buttons also feature the PL and EQ buttons. the PL knob activates or deactivates the playlist window while the EQ knob is used to set the Equalizer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">The rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons, the volume control and the play position slider. use the slider to adjust the play position or volume. using the playback buttons, you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or previous piece.</seg>
<seg id="1340">The built-in equalizer is simple and works with all audio drivers. there are 17 presets, from classic to techno, and you can easily create your own presets.</seg>
<seg id="1341">To view the equalizer, use Tools Equalizer from the main menu or click the EQ button in the player window. once you select the equalizer checkbox, the equalizer is in operation.</seg>
<seg id="1342">The playlist of & Amarok; is the most developed playlist for & kde; available multimedia players. it has many features that do not exist in any other player. but don't let the fullness of functions deter them, they are all easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The playlists window can be divided into two main areas, on the left side is the navigation area. in the navigation area, you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist, such as the context browser. the playlist is easy to use and yet even for advanced users powerful enough.</seg>
<seg id="1344">The context browser displays different information regarding the current play. its appearance can be adapted with the help of context browser designs. the context browser includes three subwindows: music, text and performer. these three subwindows will later be explained in detail.</seg>
<seg id="1345">If you have already used earlier versions of & Amarok; you may notice that the subwindow has dropped off. the information presented there has now been distributed to other parts of & Amarok; in addition, the information can be viewed in the statistics window (Tools statistics).</seg>
<seg id="1346">The music subwindow displays information about the currently running piece, as well as the interpreter and the album.</seg>
<seg id="1347">The first area in this subwindow displays information about the piece. in the title is the name of the piece, performer and album. below you can see the cover picture of the album and next to it a MusicBrainz icon. click on this icon to see the piece in the MusicBrainz database.</seg>
<seg id="1348">You can find further information about the current play under the MusicBrainz icon. you can see here how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its rating.</seg>
<seg id="1349">To view cover images in the context browser, the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece. the pictures may have any names, but pictures with the word front in the name are treated preferentially. the context browser will also display cover images that are either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1350">The next section, recommended pieces, lists several recommended pieces. if you click on one of these pieces, it will be played immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1351">Among the recommended pieces are the favorite pieces of this interpreter. this section shows the five highest rated pieces of the current interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1352">You can set which information to display in the music subwindow. click with the right mouse button anywhere in the subwindow and select from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1353">The last section, album of the artist, lists all the albums of the current interpreter you have in your collection. if you click on an album, it will work out and you will see the contents of the album.</seg>
<seg id="1354">You can click on all the pieces in the individual sections to start playing right away. you can also right-click on it and then select one of the ways to add the play or album to the playlist from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1355">In the subwindow text the downloaded song text is displayed for the running piece. this function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other web pages by means of even written scripts. as soon as you click on the text subwindow, try & Amarok; to download the text for the piece from the Internet. if no text script is running, you can choose which one should be started.</seg>
<seg id="1356">The Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics. the modified version will then be stored in & Amarok; s collection database. no running text script is required.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The search button opens a search on google.com following the lyrics for the running piece (in an external browser window).</seg>
<seg id="1358">Grouping Interpret - only groups the top level, each piece is displayed directly below the interpreter. albums or genres are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Grouping Interpret / Album - first the pieces will be arranged according to the artist and there will be another distribution according to the respective album. if you want to see compositions or soundtrack albums, this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list among different interpreters.</seg>
<seg id="1360">Grouping Interpret / Jahr - Album - Sorted by Interpret and then after the year of the album in descending order (the newest first). if the year for an album is unknown, the default 0 - album name is used.</seg>
<seg id="1361">Group Album - All the albums of your collection are sorted alphabetically with each other. the interpreter is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1362">Grouping Genre / Interpret - your pieces will first be sorted by genre, among them by artist.</seg>
<seg id="1363">Grouping Genre / Interpret / Album - This setting works just like the above, but is additionally sorted by album below the interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1364">The remaining buttons allow you to customize and match the grouping as you wish.</seg>
<seg id="1365">With the last button you can change the settings to the collection. note: & Amarok; will automatically re-collect your collection once you change something to the selected folders. if you have many pieces, this might take a while.</seg>
<seg id="1366">A search filter is directly under the toolbar. it behaves in the list view as well as in the tree view. hints for using this filter can be found in the section on the playlist in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1367">There is a selection box under the search filter, with which you can filter the most recently added pieces to your collection. you have different time windows available, starting from the last 24 hours to a year. also, you can of course select your complete collection, whereby the filter is practically switched off.</seg>
<seg id="1368">By clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the Collection Browser you will receive the following options.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Load - This lends the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces to play in the currently valid order.</seg>
<seg id="1370">Attach to playlist - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist. by double-clicking on an entry, you will achieve the same effect.</seg>
<seg id="1371">Set pieces in queue - This function inserts the selected pieces into the queue. this will play you next.</seg>
<seg id="1372">Save as playlists... - Save the selected pieces as playlists. you will be asked for a name under which the list is to be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Assign to media player - Join the pieces into the queue for transfer to the media player. for more details, see the section on the Media Player Browser.</seg>
<seg id="1374">Burn all pieces of this interpreter / Burn to CD - The selected pieces are sent to K3b and fired either as data or audio CD. if K3b is not installed, this option is not displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Edit metadata (for n pieces)... - open the dialog for piece information and let the tags change for one or more pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1376">(n) Move the files into the garbage bin... - Open a confirmation dialog. if you confirm this, the selected files will be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="1377">Mark a compilation - Select the selected album as a compilation, resulting in various interpreters.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Picking up a compilation-flag - Changes a compilation of selected albums back into a normal album. the album will then no longer be shown under various interpreters but again under the corresponding interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1379">The playlist browser makes it easy to handle many playlists. among other things, it also includes smart playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1380">The lower part of the playlist browser includes the smart playlists. they use & Amarok; s built-in database to automatically create some useful playlists at runtime. the smart playlists consist of:</seg>
<seg id="1381">Never played: a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Even created smart playlists are possible. click Intelligent playlists to open the dialog to create a new Smart playlist, where you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1383">The subwindow media player is used for connecting & Amarok; for example, to use your iPod with & Amarok; to use for example your iPod with & Amarok; in / mnt / ipod. if & Amarok; started, you will find the pieces on your iPod by Interpret assorted in the top list view of the Media Player browser.</seg>
<seg id="1384">To transfer tracks to your iPod, drag the desired songs from the playlist and let them drop on the list Interpret. if you're done, click Apply. by doing this, the pieces will be uploaded to your iPod. when the transfer is completed, quit & Amarok; and release the drive connection for your iPod.</seg>
<seg id="1385">Under the toolbar there is a search area where you can search for a file. the search is especially useful in folders containing a lot of files, because all files in the file list are hidden which do not match your search criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1386">In the lower part of the file browser is an address bar where you can pick music from a given URL. if you type tar: / home / mike / musik.tar.gz, you can access music in the file musik.tar.gz. now you can drag and drop the music from there into the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1387">If the playlist is longer than in the window, it can be difficult to attach files by simply dropping it. in that case, holding down the Shift key can be helpful: by doing so, dropping files will be automatically inserted at the end of the list, and not in the mouse position.</seg>
<seg id="1388">You can change the order by simply dragging the entries with the mouse to the desired position. as soon as you enter letters, you will only see the pieces that contain the letters. to reset the filter, press the return button until the text box is empty again.</seg>
<seg id="1389">If you enter search terms separated by spaces, & Amarok; search for entries containing all search terms. for example, if you enter one two three, the search will find all entries containing one, two and three.</seg>
<seg id="1390">If you type OR between the search terms, search for entries that either contain either one or the other search term. example: one OR two OR three. in this example, all pieces are found that contain one or two or three (or a combination of it).</seg>
<seg id="1391">If you want to search for entries containing spaces, then enclose the keyword with goose feet: Mike Oldfield. this will be sought after entries made by Mike Oldfield, but not for entries like Mike J. Oldfield.</seg>
<seg id="1392">If you specify a specific search column, you can also search for larger or smaller ones. for example: rating: &gt; 50. this searches for pieces that have a higher rating than 50.</seg>
<seg id="1393">If you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific keyword, set a minus sign in front of the search term: -something looks for pieces that do not contain anything.</seg>
<seg id="1394">For example: Mike Oldfield OR Score: &gt; 50 -comment: bad. this searches for all the pieces that either contain Mike Oldfield, or have a higher rating than 50 and do not include the comment pool.</seg>
<seg id="1395">You can define the sequence of entries by holding down the Ctrl key, and then right-click on the entries. the entries then receive a label with a number. the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played.</seg>
<seg id="1396">The playlist of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window. it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist. on the left you will find the Add button that you can add to the playlist. to the right you find playlist, empty and Random playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Next, undo and restore the buttons. this allows you to undo or restore changes to the playlist.</seg>

<seg id="1402">You can also hide the status bar. to do this, disable the status bar option in the General Settings.</seg>
<seg id="1403">The context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window, or by clicking on the menu in the playlist. via this menu you can reach the settings of & Amarok.</seg>

<seg id="1412">Fill your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and add more random pieces during playback.</seg>
<seg id="1413">Add pieces based on Last.fm recommendations (formerly: audio oscale). this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist, so you don't need a Last.fm profile to work with that dynamic playlist.</seg>

<seg id="1473">A previously selected DVD video can be converted. this dialog window usually appears after reading a DVD in the Table of Content, but can also be used alone. it contains information about the selected video, encoding settings, and even options for modifying the size and cutting black edges.</seg>
<seg id="1474">This information is displayed in the table of contents and includes properties of the medium, such as size and title length of the CD or DVD.</seg>
<seg id="1475">Displays a list of the toolbar of & k3b; if an entry is checked, the toolbar is currently visible in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1476">When this is checked, a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window. it contains information about the status of & k3b; and its activities. if this is not checked, the status bar is hidden.</seg>
<seg id="1477">The folder view displays an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives. if the table view is enabled, their contents will be displayed in the content view. CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info, locking and unlock the drive or ejecting the medium.</seg>
<seg id="1478">The Table of Content is also the interface for reading audio or video CDs when a drive has been selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view.</seg>
<seg id="1479">The header is a narrow section, which is only visible when the project view contains open projects. the header has no real function; it only looks pretty, and clearly separates the project view from the rest of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1480">This opens a dialog box for changing the key assignments for & k3b; after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part, you can adjust the key mapping for it further down.</seg>
<seg id="1481">This will start the k3b; Setup Wizard. thus, the correct permissions can be set to burn CDs and DVDs. for this, system administrators will need to enter the password for the system administrator (root) when starting the wizard.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Open the settings of & k3b; here general application settings can be made. almost all functions of & k3b; should work immediately. this dialog is meant to personalize and fine-tuning the program.</seg>
<seg id="1483">& k3b; is, like many other & kde; applications also equipped with a & DCOP; interface. using this interface, parts of the functionality can be controlled via a shell script, for example.</seg>
<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP functions, you can either use the dcop command line program or the somewhat more convenient program Kdcop. both programs are functionally identical, so your taste and the nature of your task is decisive, which of the accompanying programs give you the default.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter we assume that you can use the dcop command line program. to use the DCOP, you must make sure that & k3b; started. then enter something like the following on the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">Besides the general & DCOP; -functions that all & kde; -program have in common, supports & k3b; mainly two more parts, which are described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The standard DCOP interface from & k3b; provides features such as copyCD, formatted DVD and other features for creating new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">DCOPRef createMedia () DCOPRef createMedia () DCOPRef createMovixCDProject () DCOPRef createMovixCDProject () DCOPRef createMovixCDProject () DCOPRef createMovixCDProject () void () void} void burndvdImage () void burndvdImage () void burndvdImage (KURL url)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method, you get a DCOP reference to the newly created project: DCOPRef (k3b, K3bProject-0) Alternatively you can create a project using the command line: # k3b --audiocd and then get a reference to the project using # dcop k3b K3bInterface currentProject. using this reference it is possible to change the project via K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the K3bProjectInterface and the high-performance K3bDataProjectInterface, which can only be applied to data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void createFolder void createFolder void QString Ensemble (QString Ensemble) void addurls (KURL:: List urls, QString Ensemble) void FavoretItem (QString path, QString Quartet) void setVolumeID (QString id) void</seg>
<seg id="1492">This makes it possible to fill out a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, several folders and then inserts files into the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop k3b K3bInterface createDataCDProject) dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder bar / foo dcop $PROJECT rest / home / trueg / foo / bar</seg>
<seg id="1494">& kaudiocreator; is an audio CD; -Extracer for & kde;. with it can easily be read audio CD; s read out and saved in MP3- or OGG files. also other formats are possible, depending on the encoder that is installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kaudiocreator; is the user interface of cdparanoia (for reading & CD; files in wav files on hard disk) and by many encoders (compressed). currently lame for MP3, oggenc for OGGs and FLAC (lossless compression) is supported by default (these coding packages may still be installed from the Linux distribution).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First, the tracks of the & CD; read out and stored in wav files on the computer (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step, these wav files (usually one per caption) are compressed into the mp3 or OGG format or even in other formats as the lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD;, is used by & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not yet installed, this must be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step lame (for MP3), oggvorbis (for OGG) or other encoders must be installed, so it is probably not necessary to compile something yourself. however, only the encoders need to be installed that are needed. for example FLAC will not be used, its installation is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which encoding / file format is to be used? the chapter Which encoders is a small introduction about encoders, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word to copy protected audio CD; s: as already said, use & colaudiocreator; cdparanoia for reading the audio data from the & CD; if not the firmware of the & CD; / DVD device can handle the protection, it is not possible to bypass the mechanisms of copy protection. simply avoid buying copy protected audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While setting up only once (the setup dialog can be called up so often until a suitable configuration has been found), afterwards the daily use to read a & CD; this leads (hopefully) to the understanding of the lean approach of the user interface that you'll stumble across at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert to many formats - depending on which coding programs are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can & CD; get information from the freedb from the internet or can work completely without network, whereby everything is recorded manually.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is just a short list of the main window commands. on the step by step example, you will find more information about how this program is used, as well as screenshots with descriptions of the tabs for the configuration of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1506">Start the CDDB request of CD data according to the setup of request in the CDDB tab. (this can be local or online, in the latter case first the connection to the Internet must be established.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">Start reading and - if an encoder was configured in the encoding settings tab in the Setup dialog - the encoding.</seg>
<seg id="1508">Opens a sub-menu with a list of the Encoder available so that the selection can be read with another encoder as the default. it must be noted that before the encoder was configured in the encoding settings tab in the Setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Opens the file manager so that an already selected file is selected for encoding instead of a full & CD; read out and code.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the setup dialog to configure the type of notifications (such as protocols, spades) for program events (such as reading the & CD; finished).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the master device dialog from & kaudiocreator; with different flashcards (like encoders, to set up the encoder). here you have to go before the program can be successfully used!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, encoders and compression ratios and helps you choose the right encoder.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a lossless audio format is required. besides FLAC, there are also other such as' shorten 'or' monkey 'available for this distribution.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats that lose information through data compression depending on their psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG are the most common ones. OGG today may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but above this bit rate the differences become less important as both encoders produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'not so 'free, lame is provided free with most distributions but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ High to very high sound quality (at high bit rates), but lower quality compared to OGG at lower bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music should be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG playlists exists.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD players, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard drive) or special car stereo systems. today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices mostly support only the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of audio quality parameters and resulting compression ratios for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for more parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces, and has quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset Extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate approximately 5.5. requires 25kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate app. 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a song. good enough for music of young people, portable devices and autostereroys. but not good enough for better hi-fi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be overdone for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want to have the absolute highest quality regardless of the file size, then select this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information that is manually entered or downloaded by the program automatically from the freedb over the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can hand over / used with & kaudiocreator; and the encoding program to create the folder and file name as well as the properties of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with coding programs there is often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the encoders explain the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example, to add the & CD title to the keywords (English: tag) if MP3s are encoded with lame, the switch -tt of lame and the title parameters of & kaudiocreator; must be added. the result looks like this: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of the & / or creator parameters; parameters that can be used (= button of the button in the Wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freedb is: a free database where people can read the audio CDs instead of entering the information instead of entering the computer. it must be noted that here only text is spoken: & CD; Title, artist, name of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (note of the translator) is not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; more or less worthless, so neither the artist nor the music company can be harmed. all information can be obtained anyway with a stroll through a & CD; business, physical or virtual.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiocreator; is active to select a check box (sending an address). for using freedb may be used with another (counterfeit) address than the one in the system. in this type of configuration, it seems, the email address is not used when retrieving data from the server (This may only be the programmer who has verified the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are in many countries copies of the main database. if & kaudiocreator; to use freedb, the geographically the nearest mirror server should be needed. this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online retrieval of & CD; information during reading a & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (typically created monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which lesbian program is used to store pieces from the & CD; to store in wav files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumors that cdparanoia is used for it; who wants to know more precisely, search in source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD; s. note that the cdparanoia package from the appropriate distribution must be installed first if it hasn't happened yet.</seg>
<seg id="1537">For storing the read WAV files, the encoders and thus the desired file format can be selected. at the first opening there are predefined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a lossless compression for audio data) on the tab to set up the encoding. other encoders can be added to this tab itself.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The coding package must be installed from the respective Linux distribution before the encoding can be used. this is also required for the predefined encoders. more information about encoders can be found in the chapter "Welcher Codes."</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a encoder, you can get more information about its switches by entering a command like lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console).</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, write and read real on it and whether both cdparanoia and the audio encoders of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, flac & etc;) are installed.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you do not want a copy protected audio CD; check the cover of the CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step by step example. even if you use other settings, this can give tips on how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, understood all, but are somehow still uncertain what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, set it up and read our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps in average and ID3V1 stitch keywords (Tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">There must be cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be available as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame may, for example, be found with a search engine, as it is considered as non-free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have write permission (eg by trying to copy something into the Konqueror).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section discusses the basic setting of & kaudiocreator; something that will probably only be done once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the procedure for reading a & CD; what needs to be repeated for each exiting & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the encoders to be used for compression of the music (lame) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps). as we are lazy, we share the program that freedb use to use the & CD; download data from the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not be able to modify them at any time when the appropriate settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is passed to the reading program so that it can read the & CD; -data / pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive. if this does not work or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive is available, a look into the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the entries of the device names for the CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The card card General settings. here is not much to do. here, an additional conversion can be defined. in our example everything is loaded / typed as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only with incomplete information will be selected, so that you will be informed if information about creating keywords (tags) is missing.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card card CD; -Settings. just select both entries. we are comfortable and let the & CD; data automatically download via the Internet from a freedb calculator.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer must be connected to the Internet during the reading of the CD, so that it can access the freedb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection box is simpler, a & CD; entry is found, immediately begins reading the & CD; this is associated with low risk, if you are later unhappy with the database entry and the resulting directory names / filenames or tag entries, they can be easily changed. the directory and file name will be changed with Conquant &gt; Rename and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde; Tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, please keep in mind: if you want to manually enter everything, deactivate the selection fields and freedb will not be used. however, this is more than 620 MB, if you want to use the database before. however, if you want to use freedb in offline mode, the two selection boxes need to be selected, at least the first. the mode is set up on the following card card.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is freedb for us. these are settings for the data request, for calling the & CD; information from the freedb server over the Internet. how does the system know which data the CD should get? read the section about freedb.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we did not download the database, we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB server: please go to freedb.org and look for a mirror server near you. on this way, the load is distributed between the hosts. however, this setting will work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work exactly as far as the server is concerned, but because many firewalls bounce the 8880 protocol by default, there might be more luck with protocol 80, because the HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example we don't want a & CD; send data to the freedb server. deactivate the first check box should be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Just take the settings from the screenshot. (make sure the folder / tmp is on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneous plays: sorry, there is one reason why more than one at the same time with just one existing drive? parallel reading and encoding? the author doesn't know, so simply try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; after reading the last piece, check this to check the & CD; at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">Custom folders for temporary files: if you tick this, then / must specify the path / folder where the wav files are stored. if the box is not checked, the files will be created in the private folder. if you don't want to do this folder, if you want to make something with the wav files yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Just type as it is on the screenshot. the command is a bit long, under certain circumstances something has to be smoothed to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset Extreme 'defines the audio quality of the MP3s. as already mentioned before, this is a setting for very good audio quality, even for very good HiFi stereo systems. the resulting bit rate is average about 224 to 256 kpbs. the achieved compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for restricting the creation of tags to version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2 tags may be deleted if necessary.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Set the rest as shown in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneously encoded wav files: with a dual core or quadcore or even a multiprocessor machine can be tried to encode more than one wav file at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">That's it, we have just completed the basic setup of & co-creator; this configuration is used as a standard for each reading of a & CD; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music, you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section we describe the process of reading the & CD; we will create and set up MP3 files. the folder structure, the way the music is organized on the hard disk, has been described in the previous section. first, a connection to the Internet is set up, because we are comfortable and the CD; the process described in this section must be repeated for each extracting & CD; repeated.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a CD, which is not yet contained in freedb, the screenshots look a little different than that for a & CD; with successful data obtained from freedb. therefore you will learn the & CD; instead of retrieving data manually instead of retrieving it from the internet. comments will point to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Do not try to find the & CD; this example is a 'special' issue of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this isn't done yet, the CD must now be inserted into the drive that has been defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment, the pieces and their length should be listed in the window, as shown in the screenshot. this only when the & CD; as an audio CD; could be identified and read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this is not done, check the Help section in the section Questions and Answers, or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the CD; successfully fetched from the freedb, all titles of the pieces are already completed and the name of the artist and the album are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; key for your & CD; there, a window is displayed, and you can select the database entry that best suits your CD; fits.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you haven't selected the check box for the automatic query of freedb (on the page & CD; -Preferences in the dialog for Settings), you can also manually trigger this by selecting the first button on the toolbar. if you don't have a local database, but get the data from the internet, you need the connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 step 02: the CD editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first batch</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your CD; according to the pattern on the next screen shot. the title of the piece in the first line of the input field 'Current title', the rest of the data in the input field 'Album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist no longer has to be entered in the input field 'Current title' unless you have a collection of different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The bottom comment field can be used for the individual comments inidividual per piece, the comment field of the album is used for comments that are common for all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful retrieval of data from the freedb, the CD editor is not empty, but it already contains the data as shown in the following screenshot. however, it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor (e.g. whether all words begin with capital letters or not...), but also to check if there are any unwanted comments.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we only use ID3v1 tags. this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and on just 28 characters for the comment section. if you use ID3v2 tags, you have unlimited field length, at least on what & colaudiocreator; maximum allowed.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files later any time using tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also re-create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all encoders and file formats. see the help page for more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">In this example, this is not important as we don't provide the & CD; for more information go to the website of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap for example can be found under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing 'OK', return to the main window. simply click on the row with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The CD editor window appears again and you will see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data, which we recorded for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the fields of the current play. the title of the piece in any case and other information you desire.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all track data of the & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window does not appear when you have downloaded the data from the freedb. it is already sorted in one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the toolbar. note that the artist and the album are displayed above the piece list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check mark before each line of a piece. only the titles that are selected are read out. simply click on the line toggles the selection of the piece. make sure that all pieces are selected, or press the All items selected at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">By clicking on the selection button read the selection process, this window will appear to confirm. click OK and then we will have a look at the window with the orders and follow what runs out.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the Order tab to switch to the order window. it is in the left upper half of the window, directly below the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to check the orders. the first piece is just read out onto the hard disk. the status of the program is displayed in the lower left part of the window in the status bar.</seg>
<seg id="1601">You see this error message if you are trying to work with a code you haven't installed yet. pieces that were not successfully encoded are marked with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and the destination folder are not what we have entered here in the example. have you checked whether you have write access to the temporary files and the destination folder?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: order 4 is the encoding of part 1 into the format MP3. thus, read out and code in parallel. note the status message in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has not found any configuration option to suppress this behavior. the only thing that appears configurable is the number of parallel processes for reading and encoding. the calculator with an AMD64 does not seem to have a problem with simultaneous reading and encoding (of however two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read out while another piece is encoded and a third order is written in the queue of the encoder. after the last piece is encoded, a small window with a message for a short time appears in the upper left part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & kaudiocreator;, you need & kde; 3.x or 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to generate compressed audio files like mp3 or OGG, you need the encoders of your choice.</seg>

<seg id="1612">Hello, still reading? even if only the help menu was clicked on after the first-time launching of the program, without any clue as it should continue from this somewhat empty screen (especially if there is no audio CD; in the drive), or from the unusually short menu?</seg>
<seg id="1613">What is it about? anyone reading this has probably already started the program. it should look something like this:</seg>
<seg id="1614">A bad example: unfortunately no email. the author cannot maintain this manual. it is intended as the first version for a manual on & kaudiocreator; for whoever wants to add something useful or change it may do it. at least after contacting the author. and if you read this, he has left this section and is therefore agreeing with this suggestion.</seg>
<seg id="1615">Curiously, if you have managed to get the source file from & kde; SVN, then you don't need these informations, but...</seg>
<seg id="1616">& kmid; is the MIDI- and karaoke player from & kde; besides others, he has also some features with real-time graphics and karaoke editing of lyrics, the other & UNIX; -MIDI players do not have.</seg>
<seg id="1617">& kmid; runs under & Linux; and FreeBSD. it builds on the OSS system, so it should work on all OSes with OSS and & kde; support also supports the & Linux; Ultrasound project driver, which is needed for GUS maps. ALSA is included as soon as it supports a sequencer.</seg>
<seg id="1618">& kmid; displays the lyrics on the screen with varying colors, so that it is easy to follow the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1619">Graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by highlighting the pressed keys on the (virtual) keyboard.</seg>
<seg id="1620">Drag and drop so that you can drag and drop each MIDI file from a & konqueror; -windows to kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Supports the two existing standards to save text into MIDI files (recitals or text occurrences). kmid automatically determines the used procedure.</seg>
<seg id="1622">Session support. when you quit & kde; when playing a song, kmid will start with the same song next time.</seg>
<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI synthesizers, AWE, FM and GUS maps (for the latter you need the LUP driver and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First, you can choose Open... from the File menu. it will pop up the usual file dialogue with which help you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also drop a file from a & konqueror; -Windows into the & kmid; window. this also works with several songs at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and press the Play button in the toolbar, select the item from the menu item or press the spacebar.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; a piece starts automatically as soon as you draw it to the & kmid; window. (with several pieces they are added to a collection and then played after each other.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">If you play a piece, you can jump to any position by using the middle mouse button and navigating with the slider back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song is played too fast or too slow, you can click on the arrows left and right of the tempo display and thus change the speed limit. to get back the original tempo, double click on the Tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The space bar has two tasks: when a piece is played, a pressure on the space bar acts like a pressure on the pause pause or selecting the menu item pause in the menu item, thus interrupts playback. pressing the spacebar while no play is played, starts & kmid; playback.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be stored in two ways in one piece of music. some pieces use text event, others use lyrics and others both. some pieces have no text at all: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid, you can set which events are to be displayed and even better: the type of event is automatically determined using a song, so that you don't have to manually set anything manually. however, if you want to enable automatic text selection in the Settings menu, the Karaoke Text will automatically be selected. however, you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to set a type of event, select the entries of text events and / or property events from the Settings menu. the same function also has the keys 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files that you summarize. these are played back in series. in this section you will find how to use collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collection manager. you can find it in the menu item under the item Organize.... click New and enter the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on Copy and then specifying the name for the new collection.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can set the one you want in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">The temporary collection contains all the songs you don't want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When leaving the application, this collection is not stored. remember that when you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection it must be selected in the collection manager. there, you can add a song with the Add button. in turn, the file dialog appears, with which you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on setting Automatic Add to Collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When automatic addition to the collection is enabled, a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening (using File Open or Drag & Drop).</seg>
<seg id="1643">When Automatically Add to the Collection is not enabled, when opening a piece, the temporary collection is activated and emptied.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you must open the collection manager, select the collection and the desired song and then click Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs will be played. if you select the series from the collection sequence of the main menu, the songs will be played in the order they have been added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu, the order will be redefined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the drop-down list above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To skip a song, select the Next song button, select next song from the menu item or press the arrow on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To jump back to a song, select the previous piece button, the previous piece from the menu item or press the arrow to the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection to be deleted and click the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted, but it does not matter, as it is not saved when leaving & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizers, which are not general MIDI capable. in this case, the MIDI map translates General-MIDI events into events that the synthesizer understands.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map that converts all the events of the change patch to Bright piano in the events of the Change Herpatch to Trumpet type and thus always lets a trumpet sound when playing a piano originally.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you have only one sound card, you do not need a MIDI map because all sound cards are GM -compatible (incl. Awe - and GUS-cards, FM equipment and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There are no programs to create MIDI maps, so you need to edit the corresponding file manually (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI map is a text file that stores all required implementations for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear once, except the keymap section, which may appear as often as desired. however, a prerequisite for this is that each occurrence has a different text id (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define keymap "Name of keymap"... END Define keymap "An additional keymap..." END Define CHANNELMAP... END Define keymap... END OPTIONS... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You can see that Define is used to indicate that a section begins (except for OPTIONS) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as email so I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support can provide for devices that are not General MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section you will see how the patches of General MIDI are mapped to your specific keyboard. general use looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM-patches are in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you may not change the order and also leave no row for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M is needed to set all sounds that this instrument needs to play on the sound with the number M. if your keyboard does not support a firing signal (GM-Patch 127), you can use a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which sounds similar to a gun. to do this, enter the following into the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if you want to play a MIDI file with a patch 127 (gun shot), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, no matter which sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here the term drum patch is meant to represent another percussion instrument (drum, cymbal, maracas & etc;) and not the one with which the sound means the pitch of the always same drum (as some keyboards have it).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The keymap section is used to indicate how sounds are mapped on a particular channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section, the order of the lines is very important, as well as their presence. so you have to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple keywords for each channel and each instrument. you only have to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keywords are mainly used to map sounds to the percussions-channel. take a look at the provided keymaps as an example.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to map some channels to others. for example, if you want to swap the first and second channel, simply do it in the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are more useful for keyboards that have the percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI on Channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following sample:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel that is mapped to the channel N. if you use the keymap option, the keymap will be used with the name name for that channel. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored, which attempt to change the patch on that channel. in this case the patch is always used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch can be useful, for example, to always use the percussions-patch on the percussions-channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBender Ratio indicates in which Pitch Bender events are multiplied. if a MIDI file sends a pitch Bender event with the value n, this will be converted to the formula n * (r / 4096) and then redirected. the value 4096 is used to avoid a decimal point in the map file.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM holds that a keyboard that is supposed to play a pitch Bender event with the value 4096 to play a ton higher. unfortunately, however, some keyboards try to play two sounds up to one octave. to find the right value on your keyboard, you have to try a bit with & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI map, simply open the MIDI Settings dialog. you can find this in the menu under Settings, Point MIDI Settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of keyboards (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboards you see which sounds are played straight.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel there is a drop-down list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the knob does not light green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has (until now) two different views to display the played sounds. view the View menu in the Settings menu under the channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The pace LCD displays the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the bigger the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the tempo of a song. so if you find a song too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the arrows left and right of the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music. it contains notes, rhythm, speed, & etc; this allows the same MIDI file to perform very different results on two different devices, just as two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Good, I can't force anybody, & kmid; to use. but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, the speed & etc; you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) from & kmid; this happens because & kmid; without AWE support has been compiled. to solve the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (for example from kmid; 's home page)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I have no desire to add all files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Agree, therefore support & kmid; Drag & Drop. simply open the folder you want to add in & konqueror;, select all files, and drag them to the & kmid; -window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">First, activate the Automatically Add setting to the collection. otherwise, the files will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can press the arrow key to the left of the Tempo- LCD to slow down playback. to restore the standard speed, you can double-click the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have a & konqueror; -window with my MIDI folder and & kmid; on this desktop (if I play a MIDI file) or attached (when I play a karaoke file). in this way, I have to switch to the & konqueror; change the window and drag the file into the & kmid window.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you just want to listen to a file quickly without adding them to a collection, switch Automatically Add to the collection, and the new; file will be added to the temporary collection. opening files</seg>
<seg id="1692">Suppose you have the MIDI files A.MID, B.mid and C.mid. first you just want to play the first file. so you set the automatic addition to the collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then decide to play B.mid and C.mid and create a collection with all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! if I listen to these songs or see the postcard, it animates me, further to & kmid; to program.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; from Maacute; Malaga (Spain). at the moment I'm studying mathematics at the university of Maacute; Malaga. at the moment I'm studying mathematics, collecting MIDI files, doing music and propositions.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where to download MIDI / Karaoke files, if you have a question, an error or an idea for an extension of & kmid; or even if you want to make me happy, write me an email: larrosa @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrakis.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">If you send me a postcard or a MIDI file, I will be among friends of & kmid; count (if you want to). before sending a MIDI file, you should contact me, since I might already have the file.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I have written & kmid; completely written in my spare time and by no one gets money for it. I want to emphasize that I only use it further because / when I receive feedback from users (postcards or emails).</seg>
<seg id="1699">Takashi Iwai and Joseph H. Bühler - correction of the defect that the pitch of the AWE-cards was too high.</seg>
<seg id="1700">My thanks also goes to Jose Lus Sanchez for testing the Gus support, Ignacio Garcia for testing the AWE support, Has Petter Bieker, Ola Sigurdson, Marc Diefenbruch, Peter Gritsch, Peter Gritsch, Peter Gritsch, Ulrich Cordes and anyone who sent me a patch, error correction or even a supportive e-mail.</seg>
<seg id="1701">And of course my thanks also goes to all these excellent musicians on the web, who give us these wonderful MIDI- and karaoke files.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In addition, & kmid can be found on his homepage, which is located under http: / / www.arrakis.es / ~ rlarrosa / kmid.html. on the homepage you can trace the development, search information and see pictures. you will also find links to pages with other karaoke songs, & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend a good sound card or an external synthesizer, because the sound quality depends essentially on your soundcard. it's not the same whether you are using an FM radio or an AWE card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you don't have a sound card, you will need to compile and compile with the parameter MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL. it then runs as if you have a sound card, except that you can't listen to music.</seg>
<seg id="1705">If problems occur, contact one of the & kde; -mailing lists or send an error message directly to me.</seg>
<seg id="1706">& SMB; is a simple interface for MPlayer, Phono and ffmpeg. the program is used for playing video files supported by MPlayer or Phonon supported formats, as well as for playing DVD s, VCD s or TV and camera.</seg>

<seg id="1708">For additional help please check the page The KDE website for new versions, or send the question to The & kde; User mailing list.</seg>
<seg id="1709">The application window is made of so-called andockable windows. there is always the window with the central view. optionally, there is the window with the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to save the preferred links under the bookmarks menu, but these are individual entries. if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other, you should use the category stored playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to receive an additional hierarchy level. if you click an entry, its group and all its sub-groups will be copied to the current category and playback begins with the attached entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current play, television and permanent playlist can also be changed by editing the XML configuration files. of course, you can only do this if & KMPlayer; not running. the different files in the directory ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer /, can be selected from the View menu and as next editing mode. by clicking a sub-group, only the XML content of this section is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, you have to select a playlist from the Edit menu and select either the Edit Mode, or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes are lost when the editing mode is left or another group is selected without matching the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">Due to the ease of the author of & KMPlayer; some functions can be turned on only by modifying the XML configuration files..</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation at startup and end can be disabled by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc and modifying [General Options] No Intro = 0 of the option on '1'. if the option is not present, it can be inserted easily.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate another animation. & KMPlayer; will note the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / intro.xml and ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / exit.xml; the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation during startup does not need to be short, it is automatically terminated by opening another source. this would be annoying in the end animation, so the user can quit the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start animation can be displaying a favorite photos: & lt; smiled; & lt; bodyguard; & lt; / bodyguard; & lt; / smiled; In the source package of & KMPlayer; are in the list testing / some examples of SMIL the von & KMPlayer; supported.</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a tab for configuring MPlayer in the configuration dialog of & KMPlayer; here you can set the path from the MPlayer and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for debugging is the button 'console' in the toolbar of KMPlayer. here is the output of mplayer.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no tab for this playback device in the configuration dialog of & KMPlayer; everything has to be configured by editing the file ~ / .kde / share / kmplayerrc, like setting up the backend via mimetype. here's an example like a 'flash' with the swfdec-mozilla module:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played inside and SMB; it can even embed the special embed video embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">So that the & KMPlayer; 'flash' can play in HTML pages, the & KMPlayer; module as service provider for the mime type application / x-shockwave flash in the Setup dialog file assignment of KDE is specified.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Konqueror or SMB; is used in a console application and search for error messages regarding loading the browser module library. if there are no errors, the backend output is within the SMB; (view, console, or console from the context menu).</seg>
<seg id="1726">To always take a given backend for a certain mime type (of course only if this has been determined), it needs to be done by manually changing the ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc file. for example, Phonon should replay all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& SMB; can play cards from TV, either using MPlayer or XVideo (requires kxvplayer). before TV can be watched, the device must be used and the TV channels need to be configured. to do this, the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog, or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">To configure VDR (Video Data Recorder) settings in the KMPlayer, the dialog in the settings is to be used in - &gt; Quel- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo port. there should be detected ports from which one is selected. the encoding must be found (for example, it is PAL for West Europe), the correct name probably has a DVB in it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support for SMB can only use XVideo, XVideo should also work (probably this sort of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works). for this reason, the videoforlinux distribution for the X server must be supported. therefore, the XFree86 server must be included in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config):</seg>
<seg id="1730">Internally, SMB uses different names for the sources. at the time of creation of this documentation, these are dvdnavsource, dvdsource, exitsource, introsource, pipesource, tvscanner, TVSource, urlsource, vcdsource and vdrsource.</seg>
<seg id="1731">Are there hints as to make my CDROM drive quieter when I play from it (not from the VCD: / /)?</seg>
<seg id="1732">Yes, the command hdparm -E 8 / dev / cdrom can be run as a user root after plugging the device. it is absolutely certain that / dev / cdrom can be seen on the CDROM drive.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Xine only starts up slowly, why does my CPU need to be tested for performance every time?</seg>

<seg id="1760">Automatic completion of environments will be created by adding a new command (e.g.\\ begin {command}) by & Kile; automatically creates a blank line (for entering the text) and the associated line for the line of the command (e.g.\\ end {command}). this function can be set in the menu Setting... LaTeX commands disabled.</seg>
<seg id="1761">All documents are usually divided into some elements. & latex; allows the document to be divided into the following elements (part is the highest and subparagraph the bottom element):</seg>
<seg id="1762">In the view of the document in the structure view, the individual elements can be changed and viewed by one click of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="1763">When creating your own latex; -files, the search search can be very helpful. as soon as a DVI; file is created, & Kile; by clicking with the middle mouse button in DVI; -viewer to the corresponding line in the & latex; source code.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI; file contains a description of the formatted document and also other information such as font and is next to PDF the common output of & tex; or & latex; there are many tools for viewing, converting and printing DVI; files for various systems and devices.</seg>
<seg id="1765">When using the search search, the elements of the DVI; file are clipped to the editor and as soon as an element in the DVI; file is clicked, the corresponding section in the & latex; source text is jump to the corresponding place in the DVI; viewer.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master document: this function is used when working with multiple files. with a master document, work with other .tex files is simplified. when using a project, a project-wide master document can be set to project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Quick build: the & latex; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed (unless there are no errors in source code).</seg>
<seg id="1768">Monitoring: in this mode, the DVI; file will be viewed on the top of the pane, and there is no call to & eyepiece; after fast construction.</seg>
<seg id="1769">When viewing the Edit tool bar, the three large selection fields should be noticed. the selection fields have been developed for quick assembly of common elements into the document. the first drop-down is for quick breakdown of the document in parts, chapters, sections,... The available and latex; -statements for the subdivision are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The Other is for inserting items such as keywords, notes or references. the available possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: this command creates a description for a section, an image or another element.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Reference: used for reference to a specified term (selection of a selection box).</seg>
<seg id="1773">When using quote, a selection list with literary entries is displayed. for & bibtex; this works only if the file belongs to a project. for editing & bibtex; files are appropriate editors necessary. the author has good experience with & kbibtex; and & kbib;. the & bibtex; files can also be written in & Kile; by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last drop-down box with the name GrÃ ¶ nig is used for setting the font. it can be used to specify the font names for the main text, the joints, etc. the following symbols are available for distribution:</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & Kile, two choices are available: 1. the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and determining the settings. 2. the document can be written by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The clasps after the command\\ Documents class contain the settings for the command. the setting [12pt] specifies the font size. if the font is not set at the beginning, this can also be done in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the source code above has been entered, the & latex; source code has to be compiled. the simplest way to do this is the use of the volume building or the Schnellbau button.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be saved before compiling. & Kile; automatically executes the storage.</seg>
<seg id="1779">If the compiling of the document is out of place, it should be searched for errors in the logging function. when using fast construction, the eyepiece should be started automatically. if this is not the case, the logging should also be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="1780">A environment (environment) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document. for example, a report with a font size 12 is created, and only a few columns should have a different font. the command\\ begin {environment},\\ Huge and\\ end {environment} is to populate the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1781">Changes are fixed only within the environment (from\\ start {environment} to\\ end {environment}). there is no restrictions (number) for changes within an environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many possibilities to increase the readability and usability of the document. it can be added, for example, certain fonts, grease pressure, passive pressure, submissions, etc. these commands will either end with the command\\ end or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {emph}: this command is for passive printing and is long until it is closed with a\\ end {or} or another environment. a single word in a phrase can be represented cursively with\\ emph {word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ quote: creates a quote in the document. the quote begins with\\ start {ratio} and ends with\\ end {ratio}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background for writing the source text with the & latex; markup language is presented, follow a step-by-step guide for creating a document in & box;.</seg>
<seg id="1786">As soon as a bit of text is entered in the wizard, a few adjustments for the better readability of the document should be made. therefore, a quote, a few passages in fat and italics pressure and a poem are to be used to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, Editor View or Ctrl E can be turned back to the editor (for internal viewer). an external viewer must close its window.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI; file is created, the document can be printed or converted to a & PostScript; / PDF file. simply try and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is a continuous file format (D e V ice I nase). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvvi output such as printers, & PostScript; / PDF -converter or computer screens.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For printing a & DVI; file the same steps are necessary as for the creation of a document (see). at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - the document can then be printed (if the printer is set correctly) by file printing (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar allows converting the DVI; file to other formats. once the DVI; file is created from the & latex; source code, the conversion into other formats can begin using the buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The preference search allows the direct jump from the editor to the associated position within the DVI; file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& Kile; provides a corresponding setting for all ® latex; bindings. to do this, just setup Modern under Settings...</seg>
<seg id="1794">In order to search for the desired search, the mouse pointer must be positioned in a line of the source code and then be clicked on the preference search. the jump to the corresponding place in the DVI; viewer is then taken.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & Okepiece; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI; -document the corresponding & latex; -document by & Kile; opened and jump to the corresponding line. for this, & Table; in & Okepiece; set as text editor (setting eyepiece... Editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">If the use of express construction of the & DVI file does not open, an error may occur. if there is an error, this is displayed in the logging file or in the message window in summary.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The logging file declares the source code in the source code. in the editor, the pop-up error and NÃ ¤thest LaTeX errors may be used for errors between the errors. the log file always specifies the line in which the error appears. in order to view the error message, the error must be clicked into the logging and & Kile; jumps to the faulty line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Once clicked on the corresponding button in the toolbar, a window will appear to select the template you want to use for the document. the default options are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When selecting an empty document, a document can be written either from scratch or the wizard will be used to quickly create a new document. for more information, see the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Common users of & latex; mostly use the same introduction for almost all documents. templates can be in & Kile; created, saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / latex; file needs to be opened or created a new file. & Kile; can create a new template using existing document and selecting file template from document...</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a file New, some strings are replaced by other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables can be set in Settings... Settings General.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template it is therefore necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is replaced by typing in the document class. typically, it is used as following:\\ Documents class [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {article}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The simplest way to create a template is the use of the assistant and the associated entry of the commands in the editor. once the document was created in this way, the following steps have to be completed:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, you can choose your own template instead of the default.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any kind of latex; a simple way to create a template should be sought after one on the Internet and the steps described below.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& Kile; used & kate; as internal editor. & kate; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and highlighting many different types of text files (including also & latex; and & bibtex;).</seg>
<seg id="1809">To know more about & kate; and to experience its possibilities the manual should be consulted to Kate. users of & Kile; can begin there directly with reading the chapter work with the editor of & kate; start.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& Kile; provides very practical and latex; command reference, which can be called using the LaTeX reference. it contains a detailed description of almost all commands that can be found in & latex; use as well as their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Double click with a pressed Ctrl key to select the & tex; this means that in this way you only use\\ 'par\\\' par\\\ 'par\\' par\\ 'par\\' par\\ 'par\\'.</seg>
<seg id="1812">When dragging the text with a left mouse button, the selected text is automatically copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key, parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& Kile; has the possibility to browse and highlight various types of source texts. for example, the latex; -commands from the normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by a different color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many assistants can include additional jumping marks. this is a separate type of bookmarks within the text. the MenÃ ¤ge Edit Ankle Stamps or the corresponding key element enable the jump to the next or last jump mark. this is also highlighted with this jump mark, so that it is automatically fooled at the first input of a character.</seg>
<seg id="1816">Editing is probably one of the main aspects of using a program such as & Kile; although & kates; already excellent possibilities has been added in & Kile; important functions for writing a & latex; source text has been added; special instructions for their selection. under Edit Selection, the following commands are included in the text selection:</seg>
<seg id="1817">Choose a complete paragraph (group of lines containing a blank line on both sides). with a paragraph, not a text is meant with continuous lines (as in other text editors). this expanded meaning includes tables, and latex; commands and all other lines of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Select the word under the current cursor position. this selection also has an extended meaning as this command also includes & latex; -commands with a sweep line (\\) and an additional star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">To delete a part of the document, it can be removed first and removed by pressing the Delete key. & kate; provides the key Ctrl; K with which the entire line is removed.</seg>
<seg id="1820">Removes a complete paragraph. the definition for a paragraph in & box; is included in the description to Editing Select paragraph.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already been made clear that environments play a central role in latex; therefore, & Kile; for further instructions under machining environment for a possible easy work with latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">This command will jump to the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1823">This command will jump to the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the command to locate the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor is located before or within the command\\ begin {environment}, jump to the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering many nested ambient commands a quick overview of the surrounding environment can be lost. this command terminates the recently opened environment, so that the nested environment structure is not destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& Kile; also provides special commands for the & latex; groups specified by braces {...}. under Edit TeX group are a few important commands that correspond to those from editing environment.</seg>
<seg id="1827">This command will jump to the start of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed right in front of the opening bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1828">This command will jump to the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the curly clasp.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor is in front of or behind the curly bracket of a & tex; group # will jump to the other end of the group (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">When entering many nested groups braces can quickly be lost over. this command terminates the last opened group, so that the nested structure of the & tex; -groups is not destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & latex; two simple instructions are used as a slide. for the purposeful implementation is used in & Kile; the sign "is used for two simple quotes. also for the end of the application the sign" is used. & Kile; knows this case and has two complete signs for andlatex; one.</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic entry of the double quotation marks can be set under Settings box... LaTeX can be switched on and off.</seg>
<seg id="1833">You can also use specific settings (e.g. nGerman or french) and thus German or French characters. there are also many other languages available.</seg>
<seg id="1834">When pressing Shift; enter key & box; an intelligent line break. if the current position is located within a list environment (e.g. enumerate or itemize), & Kile; not only a line break but at the same time the command\\ item.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Inside a spreadsheet environment, add the current line to\\\\ with a ending line break.</seg>
<seg id="1836">Even better - & Kile; is intelligent enough to support pre-set & latex; - or user-defined environments. these can be set under Settings... Create LaTeX.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Some users want to arrange the columns in spreadsheets and all Et characters (stamp;); try to achieve this. when pressing Shift; Alt; seek & Kile; following the next tabulator in the above line. although this tab is not the associated tabulator, add to the column position of the current tab.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Although & kates; already a good source code completion offers, it has been added to & Kile; for special commands (mostly for latex;), there are three different modes installed. all these modes can be set up for different modes of operation under Settings...</seg>
<seg id="1839">When starting a new environment using the command\\ begin {environment}, & Kile; automatically add the command\\ end {environment} after an empty line (for the text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">When pressing the click key, the last letter of the input will be removed and then the complete list can be grasped. on the other hand, the list can also be scaled by entering another letter.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a short description of their parameters. the descriptions are obviously removed by selecting a command. alternatively, jumping nets can be added, so that an easy jump to these positions is possible and the desired parameters can then be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1842">Under Settings Kile; Set up... Kile; Complements can be made to these lists. it can be selected different devices for & vertex; - and latex; -commands as well as WÃ ¶ rterbÃ ¼ cher of the general language use.</seg>
<seg id="1843">The command mode is not useful for the completion of environments. there are always a few letters entered with\\ begin. on the other hand, the environment is used so often that & Kile; a special mode for performing environments.</seg>
<seg id="1844">When calling the space above Edit fully-deprecated environment or the key Alt + Shift key, the command to open the environment is automatically frozen and it appears\\ begin. then the ambient interruption can be continued in the simplest way and by pressing the input button.</seg>
<seg id="1845">Once this is completed, the environment will be closed automatically once again. as soon as the box detects that it is a list environment, a first\\ item command is even added.</seg>
<seg id="1846">Under Settings box; set up... box; full settings can be made to these lists. this mode uses the list of completion-mode for & tex; - and latex; -commands.</seg>
<seg id="1847">& Kile; support custom lists of relentations that are immediately replaced by lower strings. the lists can be set up under Settings... The example.cwl file, for example, contains the L =\\ LaTeX entry.</seg>
<seg id="1848">For example, the letter L is entered and the word interruption mode is introduced over the menu Edit or the key Ctrl + Alt space bar, the letter L is replaced by the string\\ LaTeX.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Large openings are not helpful for automatic translation. however, it has been found that many things are written more than once in a document. thus, it offers & Kile; the agreement for all already written desktops.</seg>
<seg id="1850">This mode can be set up in the Settings box... Fills are completely isolated. here, the threshold value for displaying the completion can also be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1851">The executable files can be installed in the ~ / .kde / share / apps / Kile / complete / mode / / / / / / / / / / complete / mode / complete home folder. mode stands for Abbreviation (abbreviation), dictionary (text book) or tex.</seg>
<seg id="1852">The Printed Graphics dialog forms the introduction of graphics as simple as possible. to view the basics on the graphics formats, the sections should be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1853">PS files are not as known as PDF files but offer an excellent basis for changes and new arrangements of pages. if the PDF output is used, the pages can be rearranged with a few & PostScript; -tools, and then converted with ps2pdf into a PDF file.</seg>
<seg id="1854">To view the results of the work, the source code needs to be compiled. all building tools are grouped in groups in the creation, compilation, conversion and create view.</seg>
<seg id="1855">For compiling the source code for viewer like & eyepiece; or the further conversion can be used the key Alt; 2. after that, the DVI; file can be viewed in the standard viewer by Alt; 3 using Alt; 4; 4 the DVI; file is converted to a PS file and viewed by Alt; 5 the PS file.</seg>
<seg id="1856">When using the express construction command, usually a viewer is called after the compiler. if no embedded viewer is used, a new window will open each time.</seg>
<seg id="1857">A new project about the project New Project.... Hierbei will ask the following information for the project:</seg>
<seg id="1858">When executing the file name window, the relative path must be specified by the .kilepr project file.</seg>
<seg id="1859">The Script function from & Kile; allows the executing of ECMAScript code. the scripts can be managed using scripts in the vertical bar.</seg>
<seg id="1860">The API scripts are not yet fully developed and can be added to other versions of & Kile.</seg>
<seg id="1861">First, it must be said that the execution environment of scripts is in & box; a system-wide object (= box) has the following methods:</seg>
<seg id="1862">Latex; is a quite developed system in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages. & Kile; offers a lot of different aids to support the user.</seg>
<seg id="1863">& tetex; and & texlive; are shipped with many documents. included is a documentation for the included packages and a further latex; -reference.</seg>
<seg id="1864">A full-depth Refernz for Frontex; and its "Young Friends". it is not just a description of all programs (but a few important packages are described) but rather is a complete user manual for the & latex; commands and is therefore ideal for searching for a certain formatting. as this is a very large document, it is divided into & Kile; into three important bookmarks.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Because of the amount of documents with which & tetex; / texlive; delivered, finding the right document is not always easy. as possible help offers & tetex; / texlive; the small application texdoctk, which contains a database with all to & box; delivered documents and herein for a graphical surface area.</seg>
<seg id="1866">All documents are divided into categories and the biggest advantage is the search for package names or keywords. from & Kile; then only the results are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1867">Double-clicking with the mouse or using the space bar opens the viewer for the document.</seg>
<seg id="1868">& Kile; is a quelloffener and user-friendly & latex; - / tex; source code editor which can be executed on all systems with installed & kde; and Unix systems; is also a part of the Fink project, which makes & Kile; also on & Mac; with installed OS-X can be executed.</seg>

<seg id="1916">The version 3.2 of & quantaplus; contains many new & XML; tools and functions. these tools are unique in their integration in & quantaplus; all these tools use commanders as surface and libxml2 and libxslt as base. the combination yields fast, efficient, complete and productive tools.</seg>
<seg id="1917">Everyone who has worked with the & kde; documentation knows me and how outstanding it is. let's raise it a bit, we give it a graphical interface! no longer need to rely on a terminal; simply click the icon for the XML processor and finished!</seg>
<seg id="1918">This application expects a index.docbook in the folder. if index.docbook is located in the geunerable working folder, then let the current work folder be checked. if not, remove the selection of current working folders and specify the folder you want in the field of other folders.</seg>
<seg id="1919">Output files are stored in the same folder as the source files. all previous & HTML; files are deleted every time meinproc is started.</seg>
<seg id="1920">As I said before, everyone who has worked at the & kde; documentation knows how helpful this application is. and with & quantaplus, there is now a great graphical interface for this.</seg>
<seg id="1921">If the newly opened file index.docbook is, simply select the current working folder. if not, select the current working folder and enter the folder where the index.docbook is to be found.</seg>
<seg id="1922">When it comes to an output on the screen its file is faulty. please check the reported errors and try again.</seg>
<seg id="1923">If the file to be checked is already marked in & quantaplus, then let the current file simply be attached. if not, they delete the check in the current file and select the file to be checked by other file - file selection.</seg>

<seg id="1928">Enter the name of the file as the result should have named. the file is normally stored in your home folder.</seg>
<seg id="1929">The plug-ins, the & quantaplus, loaded, have with & quantaplus, even possibly little to do. this makes the plug-in system very powerful. you can benefit from the additional functionality immediately and do not have to wait until someone builds the desired in & quantaplus. you can find the plug-ins in a large number of & GUI; elements.</seg>
<seg id="1930">To install a plug-in or a node, we start the Edit menu from the menu. this will open the following dialog:</seg>
<seg id="1931">This dialog allows to manage all the included plug-ins and add new ones. we describe each & GUI; -element in it:</seg>
<seg id="1932">Here you can enter the search path. when adding plug-ins without a location & quantaplus, this path to search the plug-in.</seg>
<seg id="1933">Often on one project several people work in a kind of hierarchical relationship to each other. & quantaplus; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured with Shift; F7 Project Project Properties dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1934">The name and email entries are self explanatory. nickname is the user's nickname and serves for unique identification.</seg>
<seg id="1935">One member can have several roles in the project, such as both team leaders and sub-project leaders.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The user can choose from the list of team members who he is. this happens by looking for the team member from the list and the button Setze as pressed. the currently selected member (their identifier) appears bold after you are: text.</seg>
<seg id="1937">Nicknames and the setting of their own identity are important with regard to news and annotations. see for further information notes.</seg>
<seg id="1938">Apart from an overview of their team, there is another advantage by capturing the members of the team: it can be an event for information to the team leaders when something specific happens. see for further information.</seg>
<seg id="1939">Event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project. an example would be recording the opening and closing of the project, so that later it can be seen how much someone worked on it, or sending a message when a file is backed up, or a script that enters a file into CVS, as soon as it is added to the project & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1940">On the Event configuration page of the Shift; F7 Project Properties dialog, events can be created, edited and deleted.</seg>
<seg id="1941">An email will be sent to the addressee list selected in the recipient list. the addressee can be a team or subproject manager. see where such conductors are set up.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Comments are special comments in the documents. they differ from normal comments by the following things:</seg>
<seg id="1943">Annotation is simple. either the comment item can be selected from the Editor context menu or the @ annotation keyword can be entered in a comment area followed by comment text.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Comments can be sent to a designated member of the team. in this case, the syntax @ annotation (nickname) or @ annotation (role), where nickname is the nickname of the team member, will play a role in the project from the following possibilities: team leader Area manager Subproject manager According to the area and subproject leaders, the corresponding area or subproject names should be given as in the following examples below.</seg>
<seg id="1945">Nicknames and roll names are case-sensitive, but spaces around the braces and the: make the note invalid.</seg>
<seg id="1946">& quantaplus; is a development environment for scripting and formatting languages that is DTD agnostic and supports web-based formatting and scripting languages.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The settings are accessible via the Settings menu. here, only about & quantaplus; -specific settings are treated, a short description for the others can be found in.</seg>
<seg id="1948">The settings can be set up by Setanta... This dialog covers some pages that are treated after each other.</seg>
<seg id="1949">The behavior of & quantaplus; regarding tags including car complete can be changed with it. the entries are:</seg>
<seg id="1950">Large / lowercase of tags: large / lowercase of automatically inserted tags. normal large / lowercase means the tags are inserted as they are described in the tag XML files.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Large / lowercase of attributes: large / lower case of automatically inserted attributes. normal upper / lowercase means the attributes are inserted in the way they are described in the tag XML files.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Optional tags automatically close: if checked, tags for which the closing tag is optional, this immediately after & gt; inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1953">Do not automatically close optional tags: as above for all other tags except for easy tags.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Automatically update start and end tag: if enabled, the corresponding end tag is included and vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Automatic Replacement of Accent Characters: controls the automatic conversion of accented characters into the appropriate encoding during typing.</seg>
<seg id="1956">MIME types: mimetypes for the detection of different types of files.</seg>
<seg id="1957">Default character encoding: the encoding of newly created or otherwise opened files (where the encoding of the file can be skipped). however, this setting here is removed from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD has not been detected. however, this setting here is removed from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Create a backup copy: & quantaplus; creates backup copies on a regular basis, so that in case of a power failure or crash the document can be restored from this backup at the next start of the program. this is not the same as saving the file.</seg>
<seg id="1960">The preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editor area or in your own view (or the documentation in a box), making it possible to preview the documentation, preview and source code at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1961">Reset the window settings to the default when starting the next start is useful when the user interface is confused by modifying the MDI modes and docking / hanging views. it corresponds to the --resetlayout command line parameters.</seg>
<seg id="1962">The warning message area is used to control the display of warnings by barbs from non-polls.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The place to change behavior of & VPL; it can be set the display of symbols instead of scripts, as well as the synchronizing behavior of the VPL- and the source code view in shared mode.</seg>
<seg id="1964">Here the parser and the structure tree, which represent the representation of the parser nodes in the document, can be set in details.</seg>
<seg id="1965">In the mouse click on the structure tree the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the Structural Adjustment area, the visibility of nodes in the tree, the updating frequency of the tree when editing and how deep in a change in the structure tree is to be opened automatically. empty nodes are the empty areas in the text, while empty groups are those in which no element has been found in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The range for setting shortcuts (a kind of templates), which can be unfolded when editing a larger text. abbreviations are divided into groups, each can be valid for several & DTEP; s. this means there can be a valid group for PHP, in which the ifEL shortcut is something else than in a group valid for Javascript.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Here the plugins are managed. plug-ins are Kpart applications from third party, which can be reused by each node-capable application, the most known & konqueror;. when inserting a plug-in, the following must be specified:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to the plugin if it is not in a standard as $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Input: this information is passed to the plug-in at startup, so it can open the current file, the associated folder (path of the current file) or the project folder.</seg>
<seg id="1971">Load the component in "Read-only" mode: check if the plug-in refuses to load the load. only-Lese-KParts usually refuse loading when this option is not selected.</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the plugin: if this is activated, then test & quantaplus; if the entered information is correct. choose to save the entry even if the plug-in is not available at the moment, but it should be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantaplus, as of version 3.3, troubleshooting was completely redeveloped. support for the no longer necessary built-in & PHP; (3) Debugger was set, as well as support for the DBG Debugger. instead, a Debugger plugin concept was implemented that allows various implementations via plugins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently only one plugin is available, support for the use of & gubed; inquisiaplus; inserts.</seg>
<seg id="1975">Using the debugger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable debugger in the project settings. using the Options button next to the Debugger plugin selector, the specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If a debugger is activated for a project, some additional elements appear in the & quantaplus; interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed. usually appears in the left dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view in which all holding points, with line numbers and conditions are listed. usually appears in the bottom Dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view in which the output (as shown in HTML) of the debugger. usually appears in the bottom Dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported features of the debugger, everything or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">With this action, the connection to the debugger, if required, or it tells the plugin to listen to Debugger's requirements. this action is triggered by default when a project is opened that uses a debugger, so that it does not have to be respected in the normal case.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart to Debugging Session Start the session. includes the connection to debugger or terminates listening to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends an HTTP request to the server to initiate a debug request. this is synonymous with the use of a browser to view the current document. the output of this request is displayed in the Debugger output.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script and continuously send information about the monitored variables as well as the current executed line. if this happens while the script is stopped, execution will continue. if the script is started, the script will start with the request.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script without having to send information to monitored variables and the current line number. if this happens while a script is stopped, execution will continue. if there is a debug request, execution starts when a request is made.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The debugger executes the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The debugger will execute the next instruction in the script, where it is possible to correctly clean in functions and include.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Instructs the debugger to skip the statement and go to the next one as if there was not the current one.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Opens a dialog where a variable or printout can be entered, which should be monitored. the monitored value appears in the variable view.</seg>
<seg id="1990">With this dialog a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable is set.</seg>
<seg id="1991">& kxsl; is a work of Keith Isdale as well as this part of the documentation. & kxsl; is a & kde; front-end and a part of xsldbg you can find on http: / / xsldbg.sf.net with many other works of Keith.</seg>
<seg id="1992">This chapter describes how to adapt & quantaplus to your needs and as you & quantaplus, can help to get better.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Document type editing packages (DTEP; s) are used in & quantaplus; they allow & quantaplus to provide capabilities like car complete and knot trees. their simplicity and flexibility makes from & quantaplus; a fast, user-friendly & IDE; for web developers, easy to use and productive.</seg>
<seg id="1994">& DTEP; s exist in two types, family 1, the markup languages and family 2, the script languages and / CSS; s & DTEP; s consist of two parts, the tag folder and the toolbars. tag folder contains two file types, called & descriptionrc; and TagXML files with extension .tag.</seg>
<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s can be created manually (see below), downloaded or created automatically from an existing DTD. see for details about conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how TagXML files are to be created, then the & descriptionrc; and also tool boxes. in short, a & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and content of the property catalogue, the & quantaplus; for the tag shows. the file lists the rules and information of the & DTEP; even. toolbars allow a quick insertion of tags in a document with no risk of a write error.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag folder are nothing but folder. they contain only the & descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag folder carry the name of the description language and version, so there. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of TagXML and declares whether they are necessary or not. although not all are necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better view and more information when working with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about the possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of a tag XML document. it can only occur once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but does not contain anything as a single element type.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of tag is a script function. when used, & lt; attr &gt; An argument of the function. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Only valid for the class class. the name of the base class for this class. (family 2 only)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Only valid for the Type method. specifies the name of the class where this method belongs. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2005">If yes, the tag has a common attribute and attributes within that tag can be added any other day. (only family 1)</seg>
<seg id="2006">Sets a text in the dialog. this text is determined by the & lt; text &gt; tag. this is an element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Specifies an attribute of a tag. this item can only occur once for each attribute. it specifies the name and type of the attribute. additionally, it contains other tags describing how this attribute should be displayed & etc; This is a single item type element.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Prints the source code used for filling in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree</seg>
<seg id="2009">Requires source = dcop. the dcop interface within and quantaplus; used to achieve the source data.</seg>
<seg id="2010">Requires source = dcop and the name of an interface. the dcop method name within and quantaplus is used to achieve the source of data.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, a interface name and method name. the arguments passed to the method can be empty or% tag name%, which means the name of the current tag.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container Tag that summarizes the elements of a list. it can only occur once for an attribute description. it is an element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Specifies the position of the attribute of a tag within a dialog. this tag can only occur once for each attribute in a dialog (e.g. once for each & lt; attr &gt; tag). the element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Specifies the position and size of a field in the dialog. this tag should be present for each field in the dialog once (e.g. one for each & lt; attr &gt; and & lt; label &gt; tag). this element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2015">Specifies a list of elements that may appear within the tag to be defined. this element is a single element type.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Returns a list of elements that end a day. this element is a single element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All TagXML files need to start with an & XML; declaration: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be properly chained and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces do not affect anything, but pay attention & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & lt; tooltip &gt;, & lt; whatsthis &gt;, and lt; text &gt; will be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check the TagXML files, the Tools dialog is up in the & quantaplus; window to start and check TagXML. a further dialog will appear, whose simple instructions are to follow.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not available. currently, the check only takes place when loading TagXML files in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Below is an example of a family 1 TagXML file. this file describes the & lt; schema &gt; element from the & W3C; & XML; -schema. the filename for this tag XML file is to be schema.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2022">Below is an example of a functioning family 2 TagXML file. in this file, a & PHP; overload feature is described. the filename of this TagXML file should be overload.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2023">& lt;? XML version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"? &gt; & lt; tag name = "overload" type = "void" &gt; & lt; attr name = "class _ name" type = "optional" / &gt; & lt; / tags &gt; & lt; / tags &gt;</seg>
<seg id="2024">The & descriptionrc; file is also fairly simple and there is an editor for it, accessible via DTD editing DTD settings. this can be edited diedescriptionrc; for a newly created & DTEP; for a newly created & descriptionrc; should be created a simple & descriptionrc; with the following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[general] Version = Use 1 for & quantaplus; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for each higher version. (- / / W3C; / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name is used as nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2026">An action can be set by setting actions... click New action leads to the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">This action assigned keyboard shortcut. by clicking the Custom button, a keyboard shortcut can be assigned; with K1 the current keyboard shortcut can be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. a text can be entered in the detailed settings and when executing the action, this text will be inserted in the document at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. with the help of this action external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited) that can change the document or use as input (or parts of the document), are started. examples from & quantaplus; even the Quick Start dialog or the various See in... actions for the (X) HTML-DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and interpreter must be specified. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir variable in the command line as sh% scriptdir / myScript.sh. In this way, the script tries to find: $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / scripts in its path: $PATH. there are other special variables that can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we are replaced with the current document URL. in case of a local document, file: / is removed from the document name.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: will be replaced with PID of the current & quantaplus; if only one instance is running, the text is added to the PID number. this is useful when DCOP is used to control & quantaplus; used by the external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, usually the filename of the current document, or the path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the methods listed above, a script can be input from & quantaplus, at the default input. in the input field, input can be determined what is to be sent to the default input. possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected area of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is normally only useful with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input, the output of the exported application can also be redirected. there are two types of output: normal output, written to the standard output; error messages sent to the standard output. it can be specified, which is to be done with the text written on the standard output, by setting the value the selection box output:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the markup language, it is recommended to subdivide the tags in logical groups. it is necessary to create your own toolbox for each group. in given case, there are not too many, so you can create a toolbar with the name of the popup.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a toolbar has been added, you will need to add and configure actions. select Preferences Promotions.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are pretty self explanatory. press the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill out all necessary fields and add the tag to the appropriate toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete everything and, if the tag has attributes and you are planning to use it, enable dialog "Edit tag" if available so that you can enter the action when using the action.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is this an ugly symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? let us replace it before we have difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that represents the action better, we will use & kiconedit; select from the & KMenu;, Graphics more programs (or where else it is located in your distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconcurrent; used by default 32x32 pixels, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit size others.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created symbol will not only help you remember what the action does, but also to all other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to the start of the day, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green will mostly be as loose, starte, further interpreted), or at least, a message to the user will be signaled that clicking this symbol will be displayed; starting; -day in the current document is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After the creation of the symbol it must still be connected to the action. this happens through the menu with Preferences actions... (in & quantaplus;) and selecting the desired action. in addition to the text field is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder where the saved symbol is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the Apply button and continue using other tags, so there are some or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some usual & quantaplus; functions to the toolbar or it should be divided into several groups for a better overview by some separators. open the tool bar dialog via Settings tool bar. make sure the desired toolbar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to select the separator (at the top left) for my toolbar. after selecting the element which is to be added to the toolbar, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the element to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I want to preview a quick way to access the Konqueror preview. I will select it and add it to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the separators support grouping. someone who does not know my toolbar might believe that the & konqueror; -button is the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by using all symbols to make sure everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">After releXML does not exist, it will be created in the root folder, but your toolbars (s) should be stored in the correct folder. please adjust their descriptionrc, so that their toolbar (s) will be loaded () if a file is opened by the appropriate type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most chosen extension of & quantaplus; for the normal user it is possible to add documentation for scripting language or formatting language that you like most. that's why this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; -Documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before starting your own documentation, you could check in the & quantaplus; -Repository if someone has already done that for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to search for an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; language. then you need to create the docrc file.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc dir = path, relative to this file, to the documentation html files e.g. php42 / # elements in the Main Index = Section1.html Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, tag1, tag1, tag2 = tag2.html tag2 = tag3.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, you can see now in the & PHP; documentation like this:</seg>
<seg id="2062">Documentation = php42 / # top level element element = PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Contents, # Getting Started, # Language Reference Table of Contents = index.html Getting Started = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = language.basic-syntac.html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is subfolders in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the depth of the shaft (except by reason) mdash; but try it out for yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">You will notice that the table of contents is referenced directly to a file (and consequentially at the top of the tree view & mdash; folder is displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces influence nothing, but pay attention & lt; notes. these should be replaced by & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resources files are replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The content section is the area of the docrc file that functions for creating context sensitive help. for example, when writing a & PHP; script ends the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function. there are only two types of entries here: the ContextList and the file connection lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of Context-separated context elements that are to be available (for & PHP;, these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can easily save your docrc file to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / doc for local and global use. then create a folder (as specified in your docrc) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation there.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these are good and worth being shared, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation was used to the & quantaplus; community. they will not be rich, but proud to have worked with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus, you are not alone. it is possible to share the scattered resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with promotions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent by e-mail to friends, partners or anyone else. there is an email-send menu entry, such as the DTD DTD package (DTEP), send tool bar with email, in the context menu of files and folders in the template and in the scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded into our main archive, where all the other & quantaplus users can download them. we recommend that the contributions are reviewed and only available if our team uses them as correct and useful for publication. to contribute to a longevity post, we recommend that resources are provided, both for our team and for the future users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, you are asked for your private GPG key (the passphrase is not saved), or in the event that you have multiple keys, you can choose one. in the New Resource dialog the input fields have to be filled (URL preview can remain empty) and by clicking on OK to start uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Uploading can be uploading from the DTD DTD package (DTEP) menus, upload tool bar toolbar and start in the context menu of files and folders in the template and script tree.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, before installation, investigates & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signature. if the integrity is given and the resource is properly signed, a message appears with the name of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work on XML languages that are currently not created by & quantaplus, but creation may be time-consuming because hundreds of tag files could be needed in tag XML format.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD Load and Converting a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description that should be used. then the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target directory name: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! Doctype Definitions line: the string that in! Doctype Tag, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / loose.dtd will be published</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of DTEP after conversion: if enabled, adds & quantaplus; after converting the & descriptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus, there are some key concepts. to be able to understand these and to draw the full benefit of and quantaplus, one must first familiarize themselves with these fundamental concepts. this chapter tries to explain these concepts to them without their understanding & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus, the working area is divided into three areas: global, locally and project-related. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for anyone who uses & quantaplus; all that is marked as global is stored in the shared folder structure of & quantaplus. this allows the group of administrators to secure different tool boxes, actions and patterns in the global tree, which are then available to everyone in a multi-user environment at the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development tools for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user in person.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are available only within a particular project. this can be anything from & CSS; -patterns to toolbars with special actions especially for the files of a particular project. simply said this is the most constrained size. all elements are filed in the folder tree of the project, which allows the sharing of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the editor window, the building views, the map rows with information and the toolbars. please consult and for further information on these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the file leader with the right mouse button to get a popup menu with the current document, reload, delete or upload the document, jump to a bookmark or run CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right click in the editor area to a further context menu regarding the processed document content, such as basic editing steps (cut / paste / paste), editing the tags located under the mouse-cursor or opening the file when the string is called a file under the mouse cursor.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top of the editor window, the editors of the editor are located. currently, & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as standard, for which a set of toolbars is shown. as part of the further expansion of & quantaplus, the toolbars are adapted to the new functions and related user requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of tool boxes is really easy. if you want to insert a simple tag, e.g. & lt; paste into your document, then click on the icon that represents the tag. if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes (like anchor), you can fill in a dialog boxes.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The constructional views (QIT;) enable to navigate in the information to & quantaplus; to navigate, open them and roam them. in the presentation with flash drives are available for files, project, sample templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation tree views.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project Management is a powerful tool that provides & quantaplus. this view displays all the files in the project and allows the management of the files in the project by right mouse click. actions such as adding, removing, uploading or deleting the files from the storage medium can be done with the displayed context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another possibility of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: images, program parts, a whole web page & etc.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories depending on where they are used. the category depends on the & quantaplus; work area. global templates are always available, local templates can only be used in projects.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you will find information about the available scripting languages. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can access the available information to a script. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can access the available information to a script.</seg>
<seg id="2096">This view shows the internal structure of the active document. by clicking on an element, the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element. by right-clicking an element a list of commands will open in relation to navigation and refresher the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears under the other tree views. it can quickly alter attributes and namespaces with it. the content-oriented contribution system allows you to change all available attributes with just a few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation on the web technique for your development. you can download pre-packed documentation for & quantaplus, by quantaplus; 'documentation site, you can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project, project-specific documentation can be added, edited and considered.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus, two boxes at the bottom of the window, can be accessed via the beneficial information: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This map shows information about each script running in Quanta. for example, the currently used DTD of the current document and any changes to the DTD are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This tab shows all errors in the current document markup. & quantaplus; -scripts that are executed give all error messages (as there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; tool boxes are extensively expanded and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they get the corresponding command. the chocolates page of the toolbar is the option to define your own commands as symbols in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a toolbox with email. & quantaplus; sends the tool bar as compressed Tar archive via & kmail;. if they receive a toolbar in an email, they can backup and load them in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the & quantaplus files on your system. to do this, autoconf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, type. / configure --help. the options are simple to understand and not executed here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems starting & quantaplus, you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folder. also, you should make sure that no older version of & kde; 3 is located in PATH in front of your bin folder. the same applies to & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Quantaplus; is a web development tool for the KDE interface. & quantaplus; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">While the effort to create the best & HTML editor, the developers of & quantaplus began to deal with an obvious idea: what if & quantaplus would do? well, this would make him the absolute greatest web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer on pure & HTML; limited, & quantaplus; well already well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarized: if you can define it in & XML; then & quantaplus, for this the suitable & IDE; be.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Now, to the above claim must be stated that & quantaplus; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire & kde; developer community based. & quantaplus; follows, in good application of free software, the idea of Why develop, what someone else has developed? thanks to the & kde; it allows users and developers to expand as they need it for their needs.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus; allows web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). this can increase productivity dramatically. by using self-knitted actions, scripts and toolbars, it can increase productivity, without noticing any scripting syntax. (read more about it in.)</seg>
<seg id="2111">& Quanta; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it was designed for fast web development and quickly expanded to a mature editor with many powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& Quanta; Plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of & Quanta; the original developers left the GPL-licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">For more details, refer to help: / Quanta (either this URL in & konqueror; enter, or use khelpmate help: / Quanta).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& Quanta; is currently being developed and supported by Eric Laffoon Sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files you have opened. this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it, but the oldest record is taken out.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use. if you try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder, only one error is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Converts any special characters to & HTML for inserting from the clipboard, so that they are displayed correctly and are not misunderstood by the browser as formatting instructions.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Converts the text from the clipboard in & URL; -Scheme which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in & URL; s. primarily used to insert & URL; s used in the anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Switches the block selection on or off. this allows you to select text blocks using the & Shift key.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Goes directly to a line number. this is very useful if your & PHP; -script puts out error messages!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a type grep or sed with GUI and predefined expressions to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message window or not. this is the window where you can see the display of scripts and the debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Start and start the problem reporter at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window. the problem reporter is activated as soon as you switch to the structure tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the toolbar at the left of the main window. this column allows you to set bookmarks with a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If there are bookmarks in the current file, it will appear in the menu along with entries previous or next depending on the cursor position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other opened documents appear in the menu grouped according to the filename of other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project from the hard drive. & quantaplus; -Projects are stored with the extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog for inserting files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory for new files that might be there. it allows you to copy graphics files to your project folder or subfolder and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Loads the files in your project to the server. the list of available transport methods depends on your version of & kde; and if you have downloaded more input / output modules (KIO slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings, such as & quantaplus, manages the project. in chapter & quantaplus; -Projects you will find the details explained.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Loads a project toolbar. these are stored in Project Tools / Toolbars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to save your toolbars. allows you to select the type of tool bar: locally or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens a dialog to add a new toolbar. this creates only the name. actions must be saved by means of actions... or you will be asked to store toolbars on the toolbar, or you will be asked to save the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removes a tool bar from the field of view. it does not delete it from the hard drive. if you have not saved the toolbar, you will be asked if you want to do that.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send your own toolbar to someone (maybe to the & quantaplus; team, so that the tool bar is available in the next release). the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as appendix.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Allows you to upload tool boxes to the main server, where everyone else can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Download one & DTD; that you or someone else made and convert to the & quantaplus; own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Load / refresh the entities from the & DTD; it makes sense if the entities from the & DTEP are to be refreshed, without renewing the whole & DTEP; if this is global and a write permission in the global KDE folder is not present fails the load fails.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded toolbar. if the default (HTML;) toolbar is loaded, there is a submenu standard in the Tags menu, which contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current day settings dialog when there is one. this entry is always present in the Tags, followed by & DTD; -specific sub-menus.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activates or deactivates the intelligent insertion of tags. currently, this only works with (X) HTML DTDs. intelligent inserting means that & quantaplus; inserting by tool bar refuses, if this day contradicts the rules.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the Plugins menu, the available plugins are listed under the above mentioned menu items. click on them to activate it.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Select syntax highlighting mode for the current file. the list of available highlighting schemes depends on the current file.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Choose the type of line-end identifier. very useful when you know people who use other OS platforms to develop. choose Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Verifies the syntax of the current document based on the selected & DTD; using the external application tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Immediate switching between the different types of user interface. due to some limitations in the KDE libraries, switching over sometimes may need time or create unpleasant graphics. it is recommended the flashcard mode, which is also the default setting, or the subwindow mode, which corresponds to the representation in & quantaplus, 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu provides an entry for each open subwindow. selecting an entry will enable the corresponding subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Toggles the status bar display at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window on or off.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialog will affect any application that uses the KHTML part, including the & konqueror; web browser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Directs the behavior of the editor window. in the documentation of & kate; find details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears where you delete entries from the toolbars or add them and change the sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should generate a help in line with the mouse pointer environment but is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="2154">And quantaplus; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed, but as with any open source project developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantaplus; development in financial form, they find the way here.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should preferably be filled from top to bottom, since, for example, after completing the project name, the entire directory structure will be completed automatically for the rest of the project. all these paths and author information fields can later be set using Shift; F7 Project Properties.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project, for example foo. when entering the name, the file will be filled in automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaplus; project file. by default it has the name of the project in lowercase letters and without spaces with the extension webprj (eg foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you enter the server address of the machine you want to access, except you edit local data. either a name (hostname.exempl.de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you leave this field empty, the default settings of the chosen protocol are used. depending on the remote host setting, an adjustment could be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder where templates are saved for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default templates. if a common collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder where the toolbars are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default toolbars. if a common collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to insert files from the local file system into the project. multiple files or entire folders can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have static web content that you want to download and change. in server-side scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to go differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Checked if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be mounted. if a project is started from scratch, don't hook.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option all files and folders within the main folder will be displayed and you can make an exact selection according to your own discretion.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This displays a list of files in the root folder. you can select the desired files by hook or by removing the bunny from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be uploaded in the Project Properties menu in the menu tree in the subwindow Profiles or modified using the Shift; F7 key shortcut.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of filenames (placeholders possible), which are ignored in project-related operations such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Additional option to the top, also files listed in .cvsignore, are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which is loaded when the project is opened, can be read more about project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">This allows the desired debugger to be selected. currently, only Gubed is supported. more information about Gubed can be found in. the Debugger plugin can be set using the Options button.</seg>
<seg id="2173">Uploading profiles can be set in the Profiles window (see in) as well as the display of a tree view for the content of the server for each profile by checking its own tree view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the team configuration subwindow, project members can be added, edited or deleted, as well as a mailing list. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the event configuration subwindow, one can turn event actions and add, modify or delete actions. event actions are executed when a pre-determined event occurs, such as securing a file. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, & quantaplus opens; the last project that was open. it is not possible to influence this behavior at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open another project, choose Open Project... from the Project menu or the project icon Open from the toolbar. the dialog project will be displayed and allows selection of a project. projects have .webprj as extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">When & quantaplus; closed, the project file is automatically saved. you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving when & quantaplus; changed files will be found. the same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project supervisor gives free access to the files in the project. there the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folders behave as well, but the entries are missing and opened with... in the right mouse button context menu:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Different profiles can be selected here. the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows removal of the current profile. if only one profile is present, the button will be blended to prevent the removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password will be kept in the core memory and forgotten in program memory. this option is useful when frequent uploading of files is necessary and the rather insecure password stored on the disk option does not come into question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog when you change your mind before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus, many upload profiles can be created and thus the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded to different servers. when editing or creating a profile, this dialog is displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the server name on which the files should be copied. either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed kio slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (local) and nfs can choose.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for the transfer. normally this does not need to be changed except the network administrator does not run a service at the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your fear threshold, this is either a time-saving function or a danger. use it at your discretion. the password is stored on the disk so that it cannot be easily read, but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is just a set of files and toolbars. there can be lots of views in a project, i.e. by simply changing the view, various files and toolbars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be saved, opened or deleted from the Project or Project toolbar, accessible via the toolbar of the toolbar project toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of and quantaplus, with which one has the most to do. this not only helps increase productivity, but also allows the adaptation of and quantaplus to its own working method.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As already mentioned above are tool boxes in & quantaplus; best designed via the Tools menu. use and addition differ. adding tool bar is treated at the bottom of the section Add tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbar and the icons can be set either by context menu (right-click on the toolbar), in which you can remove other actions such as toolbars, rename toolbars, or set toolbars where specified, which actions should be visible on this or other toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (icon) on a toolbar, the entries will also be removed and action processed, which are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbar and the actions on them can be set up in the Tools menu with Settings... and setting actions.</seg>
<seg id="2197">The templates are basically like a usual filesystem with advanced organization and interfaces. you can copy, move or link any directory existing to the system into the template tree. templates have in & quantaplus, in about the limitations that one presents for the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus, supplied templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions set at the beginning of each template before use accurately.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary templates are usually included in documents using shortcuts (e.g. pictures with img src = / src / url). some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be written by any text document type. based on these templates, new documents can be created. normally, more special documents are written in corresponding subfolders. a simple framework for the purpose and arranges the work in an appropriate way to be efficient. some examples may be found in the template tree under global templates. see for more information on the template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2201">These templates are useful if not a new document based on a template but the same text area should be inserted in the documents again and again. you can find everything from a comment on a final note to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl-based. some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates. see for more information about the template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates serve as templates for entire websites. they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure, combined in a compressed tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Create a document structure at will (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;.) and select File As templates Save as local template....</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once this is done, you will notice that (even if it was saved as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree. look in the template tree under project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click File As Template to save selection as local / project template. alternatively, the selection can easily be dragged with dragging and dropping onto the tree view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file can only be copied to a template folder. it can be used to use all file management functions for it, such as dragging and dropping or pasting over the Konqueror file tree.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can click on a folder in the file tree or in the project file to select a folder on the right and create a site template, enter a name for the template and secure it. by default, it is saved in the project folder, but of course it can be stored as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates enable a very goal-oriented approach. you can set headers and footers or dynamically connect with & PHP; create, insert files or link them with them. in addition, you can keep track of some things when using templates in projects.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the subwindow templates is based on the files submitted in $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / templates and $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / templates.</seg>
<seg id="2210">In order to specify the behavior of a folder, right click on the folder and select Properties from the context menu. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A drop-down selector with the three types described above; files, text or templates. this selection is blended once the attributes have been inherited.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and fits all except the root folders in the template overview. if a root folder is set like that, it would be explicitly enabled in this path unless they were explicitly enabled. in case of a normal folder the blah would appear with something like text-module. if nothing appears, you probably are in a root folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows a pre-set or copied text for templates in this folder. this could be general headers or footers for all templates for a specific project and, by copying contents templates to a folder with special headers / footers, can already be equipped with the appropriate headers / footers.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you have a context menu (Show right mouse button) over a full command collection for adding folders or copy and paste template from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; provides two modes: VPL; -Editor and VPL; & source code editor, which can be accessed through the View menu. the first mode replaces the source text editor by the VPL; editor and the second one splits the editor window into two parts: the source code editor and the VPL; -Editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it loads a document such as a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; -page and a cursor appears. then you can edit and turn back to the source code editor when necessary, in which the changes implemented in the VPL; -editor are visible in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; editor in a document containing & PHP; a small green icon displays the Vohandheader of & PHP; source code. it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL; editor. to edit & PHP, the source code editor is still necessary. there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works just like the first one, except that the changes are visible both in the source text editor and in the VPL; editor, and the cursor is active in the source code editor and in the VPL; this mode is activated, this mode moves the active cursor from one window to another, maintaining the position in the document.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools to compare. so why & kdiff3;? let me explain briefly why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated, because one of the contributors made many changes and at the same time corrected the indentation at many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program I used showed me only the changed lines, but I could not see what had changed within these lines. and there was no clues to the places where perhaps only the indentation had changed. merging these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could represent differences within a line and changes to white characters. later, a lot of other useful functions were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to quickly compare text, simply copy it to the clipboard and paste it into one of the comparison windows.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the same and merging of folders. this function converted & kdiff3; almost to a full-fledged file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">This is useful when two persons work independently from one piece of code and make changes. the original file (the base) helps to resolve conflicts and simultaneously shows the expected result. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. the screen shot shows three source files when merging:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you to compare and merge complete folders. this screen shot shows & kdiff3; in the folder:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; displays the exact differences and contrasts with the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you need to check code frequently, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white characters and tabs are displayed visible. if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters, one can see it at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side. (no more trouble if Someone changes the indentation.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is the same, and the other one differs in one line, the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both are different.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name but are in different folders, then you can ease typing by writing only the filename of the first file. for example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">1 Folder 1 Folder 2 Folder 2 folder 1 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">Open dialog enables manual typing of file names, selecting a file browser (file...) or selecting a last opened file from the drop-down list. the Open dialog will remember your selection and will show it again next time. you don't have to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C empty, analyzing the differences with two files will be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Via the Folder Button... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the same or merge of folders is initiated. if a file is selected for A, but for B and C a folder, then use & kdiff3; the file name from A in the other two folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">When merging is checked, the input field is active for target and can be edited. however, it is not absolutely necessary to immediately specify an output file. you can also do this later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The Setup dialog opens a dialog with Settings. here you can set options before starting the same / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to drag text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window. the comparison begins immediately. in Open dialog you do not need to select files, you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag and drop: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it drop over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">What is the idea behind it? sometimes a file contains several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar these functions are, it would be a relatively big effort. you just need to create two appropriate files, load them in & kdiff3; then you can easily copy, paste and compare the relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently, you can remove nothing from & kdiff3; only dropping text into a comparison window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret drag and drop text into another program than cutting and pasting (instead of copying and pasting). in such a case, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">The info line of the source pane contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and line number of the first visible row in the window. (note that Windows C is optional.) Each info line has a different color. (if the path to a file is too long, let the mouse take a while over the line. then a little help window will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are assigned the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these default settings can be changed via the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">If a difference is detected, you can see the color which is different. if both files differ, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files. that's good to see in the next section (merging).</seg>
<seg id="2306">If differences have been found, the color displays the corresponding color. in some programming languages where white characters are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (for C / C + +, for example, white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in few rare cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line separating the composite column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no lines. if the line breaks are checked, the line on broken lines is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (under the comparison windows) also has an info line with the wording Output:, the filename and [changes] if you edited the result. usually, it contains already text by automatically merging, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are resolved, saving is downlighted!!! (use the Springe buttons to the next resolved / unresolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">When only two comparative windows are used, each difference must also be resolved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in the summary column in one of the windows the group belonging to the row is marked in all windows and the first row of the group will be shown. (this will also highlight a jump of position in the windows, where the beginning of the group otherwise would not be visible.) This group will be highlighted with the color background color for current pane and each on the left appears a black bar.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes there is no more row left in the group through automatic merging or manual editing; then the text & lt; no row in the box; this is just a placeholder for the case that you change your mind and maybe choose another source again. this text does not appear in the final saved file, nor in a selection you might copy and paste somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; merge conflict; however, appears in the clipboard, if you copy such text from the result window. be careful with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: when selecting the sources the options ignore numbers or ignore Ignoriere C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigate in one of the windows, you can use the arrow keys left, right, high, down, side down, beginning, end, strg start and strg end, Siw as you are used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the output window, you can also use the other buttons for editing. using the Insert button, you can switch between insert and overwrite mode. (default is the insert mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the summaries synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group (as already explained in the merge and the editable output window has been explained).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference, to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-down / Ctrl-above), to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-Down / Ctrl-Down) or to the next / previous unresolved conflict. therefore, differences between resolved and unresolved conflicts must be distinguished.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the selection to the clipboard, you need to press the Copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Paste). there is also the option selection automatically copy. if this is checked, whatever you select, is automatically copied to the clipboard and copying the manual copy. be careful with this option, because you could accidentally overwrite the contents of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system. Unix variants use a newline character\, and Win32-based systems use cart recovery + line feed\\ r\. Kdiff3 does not retain the line ends of source files, therefore you should use & kdiff3; also not using binaries.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of the last used files will be automatically saved during the end and restored at the next start. (Set up Settings &gt;...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Select a font with fixed width. (on some systems the dialog also places fonts with variable width, but you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you enable this option, differences will be displayed in italics. if the chosen typeface does not support this display, nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">In systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in their pure form, but would be roastly represented. on these systems, the Preferences button automatically introduces an unjust color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">If this option is checked, the corresponding number of spaces is inserted when pressing the tab key. otherwise, a tab character will be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">When you press Enter or Return, the previous line indentation will be used automatically for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">When this option is enabled, each selection is automatically copied to the clipboard. copying the manual into the clipboard then drops.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which line type you prefer for saving. the default value is the commonly used selection on the operating system used.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When comparing files, & kdiff3; first to find all fully identical lines in source files. only during this first step white characters can be ignored. the second step compares each line. in this step white characters are ignored. even when merging, white characters are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a carriage return character '\\ r' and a line feed '\' at the end of a line, but then files with different sizes may look identical in page-to-page comparison, although they are treated differently.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In default, this option is disabled. in the first part of the analysis numbers and associated characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In default, this option is disabled. changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensive search for even smaller differences. the option is enabled by default. it is effective with complicated and large files, but slowly with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In automatic jump mode, this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next unresolved conflict will continue.</seg>
<seg id="2335">This is useful if white characters are less important in many files. if you need this only from time to time, then use the Select A / B / C functions for all unresolved white conflicts from the merge menu. note that the automatic selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments when the options ignore numbers or ignore Ignorer C / C + + comments.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are discussed in the chapter for scanning of folders and executing a merge. refer to the comparison and merge documentation for details under documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is stored and already an older version exists, the original version will be appended to suffix .org. if such a backup file exists with the suffix .orig, it will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adjust the language of the user interface. changing this option does not affect the currently running program. you need to quit & kdiff3; quit and restart, so that the change is active. (this option is available in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because language is set globally via the control center.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry. if you enable this option, the upper setting is used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">Above the selection fields for encoding a short notice appears, which is the local encoding. (this can not be changed here and has for you purely informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Customize the file encoding for source files. this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted. since the encoding for each file is individually adjustable, even files with different encoding can be compared and merged.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can specify which encoding to use for saving.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define processing commands, you might not be able to work with your codec. (for example, your files could be 16-bit Unicode, but the preprocessing command can only handle 8-bit ASCII.) With this option you can set the encoding of output command commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn this off to suppress highlighting of changes in white characters in text or review columns. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore Igignores C / C + + comments.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available when you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences between two of three files are displayed. however, sometimes you might want to see only the differences between two of three files. after selecting A & lt; -gt; B, A & lt; -gt; C or B & lt; -gt; C will display next to the normal still a second surest column with the information you need.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you would like to use the available space on the screen for long lines. just exit the less important windows. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">This can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you view the differences and then decide to merge the files. a simple click starts the merge and uses the file name of the last source file as default name for the output file. (if this function is used to restart the merge, then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file, it is first passed to this external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command becomes visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own preprocessor that meets your requirements. you can use this function, for example, to cut out disturbing parts or correct the indentation.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, it will first be passed to this external command. if a normal processing command was specified (see above), the output of the command is used only by line synchronization. you can write your own preprocessor that meets your requirements. each entry line must have a corresponding output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind this is to give the user more flexibility when setting up the diff results. however, an external program is needed, and most users do not want to program it themselves. however, the good news is that in most cases the sed or perl is perfect.</seg>
<seg id="2352">The\\ 1\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2353">All follow the same pattern $keyword-generated text $\\\ $\ $\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experiment with sed, you might start to understand it and perhaps you may even like these regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers is actually an already built-in function in Kdiff3. but it is good as an example for a further pre-processing command for line comparison. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Every sign between' ['and'] 'is a hit, and every hit is replaced by nothing, so basically deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several replacements at one time. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the replacements from one another. for example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed you can also use something else such as perl -p -e 's / regexp / replacement / SCHALTER' However, perl needs some details. where sed\\ (and\\) is needed, perl needs only (and) without the preceding '\\'. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal preprocessor is maintained for displaying and merging. the other operations only change the data that the line-like algorithm looks like.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases, if you use a normal preprocessor, the line equivalent preprocessor will display the output of the normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function that changes text or hides differences, you may accidentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often programmers need to edit many files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare and merge with & kdiff3; whole folders recursively.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a proposal for each object to merge; you can adjust the proposal before starting,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the merge and display the simulated changes without actually performing it,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... performs selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to comparing and merging individual files. you only need to specify folders on the command line or in the File dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If three folders are merged, folder 1 will be used as a base. if no destination folder has been specified, & kdiff3; folder 3 as destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders will start automatically, not merging. to start merging, you must select the corresponding menu entry or press the F7 key. (see more details.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">When you read the folder, you will be informed a small message window about the current progress. if you cancel the scanning of the folders, only the files that have been compared until then will be listed.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When scanning the folder is finished, it shows & kdiff3; a list window showing the results on the left side,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and folder found during the scan will be displayed in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually shown folded up. you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - or double-clicking on the object or by double-clicking the arrow keys for left and right. the directory menu contains two functions to open all subdirectories and open all subdirectories with which you can open and open all folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">Double-clicking on a file will start the file comparison and a comparison window will appear.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The symbol in the name column reflects the file type in the first folder (A) again. these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders, then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object. if the merge operation is started, you will be notified of any problems of this type.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As shown in the picture above, the colors red, green, yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C.</seg>
<seg id="2376">For identical entries, however, the color is also identical, even if the age of the entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered identical, if their entire contents are identical. then also folders have the same color. in folders, age is irrelevant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea for this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colors reflect the colors of a leaf which is only green, then becomes yellow and later when it is old, red becomes.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical, but not B: copy B (or if B does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical, but not C: copy of C (or if C does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical, but not A: copy of A (or if A does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same file type (for example, if A is a folder and B is a file): errors: conflicting file types. as long as such erroneous objects exist, merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B do not have the same file type (for example, if A is a folder and B is a file): errors: conflicting file types. as long as such erroneous objects exist, merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The syncing mode is active when only two folders and no explicit target folder have been specified, and if the option synchronize dirs is active. then select & kdiff3; the necessary action so that both folders are identical. if for one entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist but are not identical: merge and save the result in both folders. (the user sees as visible file names for the output file only B; directly copied & kdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">When two folders are merged and the option New file instead of merging (unsure) is enabled, then check & kdiff3; the date of the files and suggests the newer file to copy. if the files are different but the date is identical.. As long as such errors are not removed, merging the folders cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">While merging, one file is processed after another. the Status column shows skill when merging is successful, and according to other messages when something unexpected occurs. when merging is completed, you should make a final check and see if the status is all right.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If the file comparison method is selected in the Setup dialog, Kdiff3 will display more columns. these contain the number of unresolved, deleted, non-white and white conflicts. (the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either merge the just selected entry (file or odd), or all entries at once. if you have selected all the merging actions (also in all subfolders), you can start merging.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you do not specify a destination folder, then in the Three folder Merger mode C is used as the target, when two folder merges B is chosen as the target and when synchronizing A and / or B is used as the destination.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a destination folder, please check if all the entries that should be in the destination folder can also be displayed in the folder structure. there are some options by which certain entries can be skipped. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all entries: select directory merge / continue in the menu menu or press F7 (the keyboard shortcut). to merge only the current entry, select action from the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If invalid file types still exist invalid merge-actions, a message appears that indicates the faulty elements. you can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you merge all the entries, a dialog box with the options will appear, simulate and Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select Simulate if you want to see what would happen without actually making any changes. you will then receive a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then perform certain actions with all entries. if a manual intervention is necessary (merge a single file), a merge window opens (note the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">Once you have finished with a file, select / continue / continue directory merge or press F7. if you haven't saved yet, a corresponding dialog appears. then & kdiff3; continue its work with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">At the end of the list, you will see some error messages that will help you to check the cause of the problem. if you continue merging (F7 key), it lets you choose another action for the entry or solve the problem in a different way before proceeding with the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If a number of entries have been combined individually, the entries (in the current session) will not be combined again. even if the merge has been skipped or not saved, these entries will be considered completed. only if you change the merge action, these entries will be merged again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (Set up menu Setting - &gt; Kdiff3...) has now a section called directory merging with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files matching the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree. there can be several patterns entered. separate the pattern with a semicolon;. valid placeholders: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default is *. folders must not match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholders: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholders: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignores files that would be ignored by CVS. many authmatically generated files are ignored by CVS. the big advantage is that this can be set with a .cvsignore file. (see info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems, files have a hiding attribute. in other filesystems, a previous point marks a file as hidden. this option lets you decide if these files are to be displayed in the element tree or not. this option is enabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">When the option is turned off, symbolic links are compared. if the option is turned on, the files are compared to which the links show. this is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">For links to folders: if the option is turned off, the symbolic links are compared. if the option is turned on, the links will be treated like normal folders and checked recursively. (note that & kdiff3; does not lead to possible recursions) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Performs a complete analysis of each file and displays the statistic columns. (the number of resolved, unresolved, non-white and white conflicts.) The full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower when applied to files containing no text. (enter a corresponding anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders over a slow network, it might be faster to compare only the change date and file size. however, this speed advantage will cost you some degree of security. please use caution. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">The files are considered identical, if they are identical. this can be useful, for example, when copying the change date. please use caution. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activates syncing mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder is specified. in this mode, the suggestions for merging are selected in such a way that afterwards both folders are identical. also the results of merging files are stored in both folders.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, instead of merging it will be suggested copying the newer file as action. (this is considered unsafe because it will check the knowledge that the other file has not been changed either.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another backup file, the original version will be renamed to .orig. If an old backup file exists with the .orig extension, it will be deleted without further backup. this also applies to the normal merge of individual files, not only the merge of entire folders. this option is enabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally the folder merges view remains visible while merging individual files; you can switch the window divider with the mouse. if you don't want this, you can switch the main window in the window menu and switch between the two views by switching between the directory & text window.</seg>
<seg id="2415">You can also directly merge a single file without first having to run the folder. as soon as you save the result, the status will be checked and the file will not be merged once you start the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2416">This status is lost, however, if you re-read the directory: directory menu: re-read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of KIO slaves. KDE uses this to read files and folders. in this way, you can specify files and folders to open which are located on local or remote hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with one on an FTP server. the second command line compares a folder inside a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax as local files and folders. you should note a few things:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relative and. or.. included. this is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, spaces &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file has the name / # foo # the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the file system on the server, sometimes through the protocol used. it follows a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows. then a file is always accepted as a link target. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to edit permissions or change dates. therefore, the permissions or the modification date deviate from the original. (note the option Trust of Size.) (This is only possible for local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose of use is currently the difference viewer in KDEVELOP. KDEVELOP starts first of all the built-in differences viewer. to start bediff3, press the right mouse button on the difference viewer and then select In KVIDE3DPart display from the contextual menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally, & kdiff3; 2 complete input files. if it is applied as a part, it takes & kdiff3; the name of the original files from the patch file. at least one of the two files must exist. then, & kdiff3; the program patch to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In Konqueror you can click on a patch file and select Preview in - KDiff3Part from the context menu. please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists. furthermore, this is unreliable if the original files have changed since the creation of the patch file.</seg>
<seg id="2428">When & kdiff3; executed as part, it only supports comparing two files, a very small toolbar and menu. merging or comparing folders is not supported in the KPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and Kdiff2 (now hot comps) are already available. in addition, the name Kdiff3 already indicates that it can perform together like the diff3 program from the Diff Tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I have been using GPL programs for a very long time and learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs. this is my thanks to all programmers who have gone through this path or that they will go this way.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You compiled the program from the sources and probably didn't tell the configure script the correct prefix to KDE. in default configure installs configure in / usr / local, but then KDE can't find the resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiffui.rc). in the README file, you will find more information about this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines are treated as identical; however, if only a non-white character is different, the line is treated as not identical. iF similar lines, next to each other, this is the attribute this is more often the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor notices every difference in the files where it starts and where it ends. however, this is necessary to solve a conflict simply by clicking in the source code and selecting the button A / B / C. however, this important information is lost if the result is simply stored as a text file and it is too much effort to create extra a separate file format that might store this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">You can always restore a particular version by selecting a source A / B / C. to edit larger amounts of text a different editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text, suddenly; no src linens; appeared and the text cannot be deleted. what does this mean and how can it be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; uses already many colors to highlight differences. even more emphasis would be confusing and missing the purpose. please use another editor for this.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all functions of & kdiff3; you need & kde; 3.1 or later.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information on how to use KDE on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">A list of the last changes can be found at http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / ChangeLog or in the file ChangeLog in the source package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compress and install on a system with & kde; to compile and install, use the following command in the & kdiff3; -Distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir returns the folder in your system where KDE is installed. if you are unsure, you will find further details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Because & kdiff3, autoconf and automake use, you should not have problems while compiling. if difficulties persist, please report them to the & kde; -mailing lists.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut out (Ctrl-X or Shift Delete) copy into the clipboard and delete the selected text. insert (Ctrl-V or Shift-Insert) inserts the text from the clipboard at the current cursor position and replaces the current selection.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Show only differences: files that are identical in all folders will not appear in the folder structure, and therefore not in the destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, you need to re-read the folder with the Refresh function after changes to these options.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">This also causes identical files not to be copied to the destination folder when merging. if the destination folder doesn't already contain these files, they are missing after merging. (the behavior will likely be modified in a later program version.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons to select the source with the caption A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the rows from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window (if they are not already available). if the rows are already present, they will be removed by clicking the button again.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In default, this option is disabled. differences in single characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated like differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & Kpager; displays a mini preview of all virtual desktops. it is quite practical to see the running programs on the worktops, change their size, end them or shift them. this works both inside a desktop as well as several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & Kpager; can display all virtual working areas as well as the applications running it. applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button, windows can be moved within & Kpager; the movement is possible both within a working area and on other working surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked: if on the empty background of & Kpager; clicked, the context menu has only the two entries of Pager. when clicked, the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries minimize, maximize, on work and end. the commands cause the following:</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window to the full size of desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to the selected virtual desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is selected, windows can be moved within the & Kpager; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other worktops.</seg>
<seg id="2457">When this field is checked, the & Kpager will display the names of virtual desktops.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Tick this field lets the & Kpager; display the numbers of virtual desktops. if it is ticked together with name, the names will be tagged with ordinal numbers, & eg; 1st Desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2459">If this field is checked, the background of each desktop will also be shown as background in the & Kpager; displayed.</seg>

<seg id="2481">& Kmag is a very powerful application that is constantly extended by new features. it is optimized for use on high-performance computers.</seg>
<seg id="2482">When you start & Kmag, a window appears as shown above. the main window of & Kmag shows the enlarged area of the screen. in the following, this window is called magnifying window. the picture shown in the magnifying window is an enlarged area of the screen and is described in the following as a selection window.</seg>
<seg id="2483">In the default setting & Kmag; the area around the mouse pointer like a moveable loupe. alternatively, you can add a selected screen area in the magnifying window (dropdown window) or the environment of the mouse pointer at the edge of the screen (eg; on the left edge of the screen).</seg>
<seg id="2484">You want to avoid that the mouse cursor is displayed in the enlarged pane, select the mouse cursor position. please note that the mouse pointer is still not able to recognize the shape of the mouse pointer. this is always the default kde; / Qt; pointer.</seg>

<seg id="2486">Move the mouse cursor in the magnifying window and hold the left mouse button pressed, so you can capture and move the contents of the magnifying window. this is also done using the arrow keys.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If you additionally press the & Shift key or the & MMB; use, you can shift the selection box.</seg>

<seg id="2497">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse-click as soon as the mouse-cursor is waiting for a while at the same place. it is thought to help people suffering from RSI syndrome (Repetitive-Strain-Injury Syndrome) and that each mouse-click causes pain.</seg>
<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse-click as soon as the mouse-cursor is waiting for a while at the same place. it is meant to help people who suffer pain at the Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) syndrome.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can circumvent the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, pain caused by the use of your computer may also cause pain.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To make it clear: even if & kmousetool; avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse, it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse. and as with all ergonomic aids, the result can be different for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and takes a mouse-click away as soon as you break the motion short.</seg>
<seg id="2502">If the intelligent shift activates, makes & kmousetool; a pause after pressing the mouse button is emulated. move the mouse, wait until the end of the movement before releasing the mouse button. in this way, you can pull the dragging with pressed mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This residence time has to be hidden after the end of the mouse movement before & kmousetool; a mouse click is executed.</seg>
<seg id="2504">When Intelligently shift is enabled, the shooting time (1 / 10 s) is activated. here, the time is set, the & kmousetool; after clicking the mouse button wait before releasing the mouse button again if no moving of the mouse occurs in the meantime.</seg>
<seg id="2505">This function activates, creates a slow moving to the right and back, followed by a pause, a click with the right mouse button. a slow moving to the left and back leads a double click. these movements are stored in the file $KDEHOME / share / kmousetool _ strok.txt if & kmousetool; the first time is started, but they can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">If the sound appears delayed, you can & kde; move to shorten the response time. go to the & kcontrolcenter; go to Sound & Multimedia, select Sound System and here the tab General. there is a slider Sound Buffers you set to a lower value to shorten the response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is selected, & kmousetool is started; at each start of & kde; started. this function is currently only available under & kde; please refer to the respective documentation for GNOME or other window environments to find out how to start a program automatically there.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Set all settings to the values set when the dialog opens. if you already press the Apply button, the settings will be reset to the state after the last push of Apply.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Best use & kmousetool; first with default settings. in particular, the intelligent shift should first be switched off. if you then get used to automatic mouse clicks, you can later remove the intelligent shift.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it may be necessary to reduce the response times of & kde; in case of sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First you should be aware of which places a mouse-click remains without effect: clicking on the neutral components of windows or in places in the browser window that does not represent a link does not lead to unwanted reactions. you can therefore park the mouse in such places until you want to use them again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">When your mouse is bucking, you should clean your mouse. this is usually pretty simple. the trick is that you do not only clean the mouse ball, but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First you have to remove the mouse ball. as this happens, mouse is different to mouse. however, it should be clear if you look at the underside of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the wheels. these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted. dirt and dirt can easily scrape with a flat blade or the fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations, the operating system interrupts execution of & kmousetool; if you use the smart move in this case, it means that & kmousetool; the operation can no longer be terminated by releasing the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; use under any other window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you own a mouse click. this will reset the status of & kmousetool; reset and you can continue to work as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you type text, try & kmousetool; continue to run mouse clicks and put the cursor in another place.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor to where you want it. but parking the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop, if you want to make a keyboard input. thus, accidental moving of the mouse-cursor can cause unwanted reactions. secure zones for the mouse-cursor are & eg; the gray areas around the toolbars and menus and the title line of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with the intelligent shift, but I don't manage to edit lyrics.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The intelligent shift is an advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes time before you can handle it. it is probably possible to copy text, copy it to the clipboard, or to execute any other action where you wish to move the mouse with pressed mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use the intelligent move if you just start using & kmousetool; use it as follows: at the end of the text area, hold a mouse click and hold the Shift key pressed while you move the mouse pointer to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. this will each time, when & kmousetool; the mouse button expresses a sound like a mouse click away. later, you can use the intelligent shift also without the audible mouse click. however, this requires some exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To use & kmousetool, the XTest extension for & X Window needs to be installed. this should be the case on most of the system.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse click is only available when the system has a sound card and speakers and is set up correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; numbs the mouse button as soon as the mouse pointer freezes. this program has been developed for people suffering from RSI syndrome and which causes pain to be pressed.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool; can also be configured to wait for a certain time to start a pulling operation before releasing the mouse button. in this way, dragging and dropping with the mouse can also be performed.</seg>

<seg id="2548">With the buttons at the right of the page you can delete or add dictionaries, change the order of the books or export them to a file. below the list you can select the name and in the selection box the language for the dictionary.</seg>
<seg id="2549">Select the language you want for this source; & kmouth; then read the & kde; documentation. the frequency of each word is easily determined by counting the occurrence. additionally, you can compare the wordlist with an OpenOffice.org dictionary to insert only properly written words into the new dictionary.</seg>

<seg id="2554">Actions like adding new text passages or books or deleting selected text passages and books can either be accessed through the selection in the menu bar, in the toolbar or through a drop-down menu.</seg>
<seg id="2555">You can change the order of text passbooks or text passages by dragging the mouse over the new location or using the arrow keys and the & alt key.</seg>

<seg id="2592">For the first start of tmgr or as long as no speakers are set up, the card board speaker is displayed. see also. if you have at least one speaker, the card card General will be displayed generously.</seg>
<seg id="2593">Most TTS Synthesizers offer different languages and voices, as well as various male or female, or those that differ in volume or speed. you should also set up several variants for a synthesizer. you should at least set up a speaker before you use & ktts; otherwise the program speed dispatcher would otherwise use the standard speaker.</seg>
<seg id="2594">Several speakers for the same synthesizer are comparable to several printer expectations for the same printer.</seg>
<seg id="2595">If you click on the map leader speaker in kttsmgr, the card board narrator will appear. this will also appear automatically when you start ttsmgr and no speaker is set up.</seg>
<seg id="2596">All speakers already set up appear in this list. the preferred actors appear in the list above. the top speaker is used for voice output if an application does not present a speaker.</seg>

<seg id="2619">Filter for string replacement provides a good way to correct in & kth; wrong stressing or erroneous outspoken messages. the file kmail.xml, which is part of the delivery of & ktops; is a good example. it removes the tags br and b from the messages that KMail sends, and also the expression / local / inbox, as it can be assumed in most cases as presupposed.</seg>
<seg id="2620">Filters are one of the advanced features of & ktt; for normal work with & ktops; filters are not required.</seg>
<seg id="2621">Text is edited in filters before being sent to the speech-speech tool. they are useful for improving the pronunciation to replace wrong spoken words or abbreviations, select a suitable language and speaker, or to avoid certain shortcomings of speech synthesizers and their voices.</seg>
<seg id="2622">To understand how filters work, it is important to know how the speech-speech program works with a text. & ktots; differentiates four types of texts.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The output of screen readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders. if the output of the screen reader is read, the retained jobs will be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important messages such as & eg; processor is subject to hot. a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text.</seg>
<seg id="2625">News have the highest priority. a message breaks normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that uses messages. while you can read a long text on a website, you can talk to & kmouth; someone just enters the room.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text orders. every order you get from the card card orders is a text order. KSayit is an example of an application that uses text commands. text orders are intended for the output of longer texts that do not possess any particular urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four order types are processed in queues, with the exception of the output of Screen Readers. when an application sends the output of a screen reader, while & ktts; just one of them reads, this output is stopped and stopped.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First you need to know that filters will never be applied to the output of Screen Readers. they are applied to normal alerts, messages and text orders as well as on & kde; messages.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filter edit the text and pass it on to the next filter. currently there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are designed as modules. in the future there can be even more types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">String replacements replace parts of a text with other text. the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions. & ktots; is supplied with predefined string replacements such as: -) by text or for reformatting messages from & conversation; or & kmail; in a better understandable way.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; -reformers use an XSLT file (XML; style Language - Transforms) to convert & XML; from one format to another format. included are some XSLT files for translating & XHTML; included in SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With speaker selection filters, you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that has sent the text to & kth; for example, if you have set a female voice on the card board speaker, you can read text from KDE messages about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these different filters has adjustable rules, according to which it is applied for voice output. if the filter detects that its rules do not apply, it will continue the text unchanged to the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">If a text order, a message, warning or a & kde; message is sent, it is processed by all activated filters, which have been set up on the bottom of the page. the processing by the filters is done in the order in the list from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2636">This shows the list of the normal filters. if a filter is not checked, it is not activated and is not used. filters are processed from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2637">Click here to insert a new filter. select the type of filter and the further down menu dialog will be displayed below.</seg>
<seg id="2638">For the set-up of string replacement filters, you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison pattern. if these patterns are found in the text, the text will be exchanged for the corresponding replacement text.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Enter a name for your filter. you can choose this name arbitrarily; it only needs to be distinguished from the names of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with the strings in the column matches and replaces it in accordance with the string from the Replace column.</seg>
<seg id="2641">Click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2642">With these buttons, you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file, save or delete the current list. load a list from a file, the entries will be appended from the file to the existing list.</seg>
<seg id="2643">If a language is entered here, the filter will only be applied if the speaker for the text order is one of the languages listed here. click the button to display a list of languages. you can also select multiple languages if you press the & Ctrl key.</seg>
<seg id="2644">If a value is entered here, the filter will only be applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications. you can enter several programs separately by commas. example: conversation, kmail</seg>
<seg id="2645">The application ID running programs will get you with the program qdbus;. the & dbus; numbers must omit you. if for example, and qdbus; the application ID copied-3432, you may only enter copy.</seg>
<seg id="2646">The string replacement filter is only applied to the text when all conditions apply with an entry in the box Diesen filter if all input fields are empty, the filter is applied to all texts.</seg>
<seg id="2647">When comparing words, the string replace filter uses regular expressions in the form\\ s word\\.</seg>
<seg id="2648">In this manual, you will not find instructions for writing regular expressions. if you have installed the & kde; -Editor & # 160; Regular & # 160; Expressions installed, you can call it in the dialogs add or edit as help to assemble these expressions.</seg>
<seg id="2649">XSLT (XML; Style Language - Transforms) is a W3C standard for such conversions. but it can only be applied to well-formed XML. the xsltproc utility has to be installed on your system.</seg>
<seg id="2650">Enter the path for the xsltproc program. if xsltproc is reachable via the environment variable PATH, xsltproc is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2651">With the speaker selection filter you can send text to a particular speaker set up on the card board speaker or to a speaker with certain features. you can, for example, set that texts from kmail should be read from a female voice.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Before a text is passed to the filter, it looks for a speaker for the text. the speaker is selected based on the speaker's features that the program sends, and the characteristics of the speaker set up on the card board speaker. the speaker selection filter lets you overwrite the selected speaker.</seg>
<seg id="2653">If a value is entered here, the filter is applied if the text contains the entered regular expression. is installed on your system of & kde; -Editor & # 160; for & # 160; Regular & # 160; Expressions installed, you can call it by clicking on the button to get help when entering.</seg>
<seg id="2654">To achieve faster processing, try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string, that is, start the regular expression with &lt;! [CDATA [^]] &gt;.</seg>
<seg id="2655">Here you specify the characteristics of the desired speaker. if the text meets the filter conditions shown above, the speaker will be selected to match the desired requirements. click the button on the right to see the dialogue selection dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Use these buttons to save or load your subscriber settings or delete all settings.</seg>
<seg id="2657">The speaker selection filter is only applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Diesen filter if applicable. you must enter at least one condition.</seg>
<seg id="2658">The speech output API, from & kde;, with which programmers can give their applications TTS skills. applications communicate with KTTSD about & dbus;.</seg>
<seg id="2659">The KTTSD module API, with voice synthesizer can be added to KTTSD, so that & ktts; this synthesizer can use.</seg>
<seg id="2660">The following section provides a brief description of the & kde; -DBus; interface of the language output API from & kde; the complete documentation for both APIs can be found on the kde; Accessibility website (http: / / accessibility.kde.org).</seg>

<seg id="2666">I have set up the & HTML; -XML; -Forming filter, but when using the module for festival websites are not read.</seg>
<seg id="2667">Due to an error in Festival 1.95 beta, you must install the (male) voice rab _ diphone so that Sable works at all. you have to do that even if you do not use this voice to read web pages. also make sure the program xsltproc is installed and can be found through the environment variable PATH.</seg>
<seg id="2668">Certain characters or punctuation marks seem to cause errors during the synthesizer, so that whole sets are skipped or only chewing-reindeer is spent. what can I do about it?</seg>
<seg id="2669">First, make sure that the character encoding option is set to the right value for the corresponding language. if there are problems with certain characters or words, these may be remedied by a string replacement filter.</seg>

<seg id="2676">The list of languages mentioned above can be incomplete or outdated. therefore, consult the description of the synthesizers to the supported languages. check also on the website of ktown;, according to information which are not yet contained in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2677">The speech-dispatcher program uses an adaptable module architecture for voice synthesizers. if you want to expand & tect; for the use of a different synthesizer, please contact the development team.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The xsltproc program is used for the support of SSML and for the & XML; conversion filter but is not mandatory. Debian users can install xsltproc with the apt-get install xsltproc command.</seg>
<seg id="2679">To compile and compile, you need a current development environment from KDE (Version 3.4 or newer) including the packages kdelibs and the development files for the speech-speech program.</seg>
<seg id="2680">If you have downloaded & downloaded the source code from & ktye; from the source code archive for downloadable or downloaded tarball every night, compile and install the program with the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2681">Before using & Desktop, check first if speech-dispatcher works correctly with your speech synthesizer. to do this, you can use the shell script spd-conf.</seg>
<seg id="2682">& ktts; in & kde; 4.4 is the first version of speech. the program kttmsg should be developed in such a way that the setup of speech-dispatcher is directly possible and the script spd-conf is no longer needed.</seg>
<seg id="2683">A long text is disassembled into individual sentences. the user can return punctuation or sales manner, repeat the output, pause or cancel the output.</seg>
<seg id="2684">For example, if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and whose sex is female, it will be used, otherwise the best matching speaker will be used. if you want to know more about how & ktats; select a speaker, you will see in it.</seg>
<seg id="2685">If you click Add to add a speaker to the list or click Edit, the board speaker facility will appear. as an example, the module for Festival Interactive is shown below. for details on the modules, see below.</seg>
<seg id="2686">Enter the path to the executable festival program. if the path to the festival is included in PATH, you only have to enter festival.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Select the encoding for text that is passed to the festival. for voices, which are & ktts; known, this setting is automatically done. generally, Western languages will use ISO 8859-1, eastern languages like Czech or Slovak use ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2688">With these slider controls you can adjust the volume, voice speed and pitch of the synthetic language. if you cannot select some of the controls and this grey is displayed, the voice you choose doesn't allow these settings to be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Some voices such as multi-syn voices need to be loaded for several seconds due to their size. if you select this check box, these voices are already loaded at the start of the KTTSD, so that (with larger memory consumption) the first set is synthesized faster.</seg>

<seg id="2704">The output of Screen Readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders. once the screen reader's output has been read, the retained jobs will be resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Warnings have the next higher priority. this level is important messages such as & eg; processor is reserved to hot. a warning lasts the output of messages and normal text. these orders will resume after reading the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2706">News have the next priority. a message breaks normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that speaks messages. if you have just read a long text on a website, you can talk to & kmouth; nevertheless, someone who just enters the room.</seg>
<seg id="2707">If a text order is interrupted by a message, warning or output of a screen reader, the audio output will be inserted into the queue.</seg>

<seg id="2722">The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) is a W3C standard to mark text for voice output. this standard contains trademarks for controlling voices, voice speed, volume, gender of voice and pitch.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently supported & ktts; SSML only partially and only in the basic functions. the following limitations are available:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You need to install the rab _ diphone voice (British male) since this is the standard, the festival is used in the output of SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2725">If settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100, SSML is usually spoken very monotonously.</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and set-limits recognition filters (SBDs) subdivide text into single phrases. this allows you to start faster with reading, since only the first sentence has to be synthesized, not the whole text order. thus, you can also jump or stop orders on the card card, even if the voice synthesizer does not support this directly.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you can see the Statutes Automatic filter. at the first start of & ktye; a set-border detection filter is set up as default. you can change its settings or add more set-limits recognition filters, but beginners are advised.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The easiest way to learn about setting up the voice selection is by clicking on. switch on the selection of speakers and enter text for reading. check the list of speakers, change some properties and check how the speaker's selection changes. of course, you need to have more than one speaker, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktye; then you can start reading faster, because only the first set has to be processed and not the whole text block, which can take a long time,</seg>
<seg id="2731">You can then stop or cancel text jobs on the card card, even if the voice synthesizer does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal rate recognition filter is automatically set up when you start ttsmgr for the first time. it cannot be turned off, only removed. do not change anything about this filter unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Pattern Recognition Filters compare text with a regular expression for punctuation and insert a tabulator character (decimal code 8) at the set limits. note that the standard set limit filter preserves the punctuation.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filters will never be applied to & kde; messages (knotify), warnings, messages or the output of screen readers.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed the normal set-up filter by mistake, you can insert it again by loading the contained file standard _ sbdrc.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The card reader option allows you to override the speaker settings for the application. the card card is displayed when</seg>
<seg id="2737">Use of the standard speaker (the top of the card board speaker). in other words: no speaking characteristics are specified.</seg>
<seg id="2738">Use of the most appropriate speaker that has all the characteristics of a set up speaker. if you do not delete or edit the settings of the speaker, select & tts; otherwise select & tts; the speaker that best matches the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Select the method to enter the desired speaking properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Select here the properties of the desired speaker. if this property does not matter, enter nothing.</seg>

<seg id="2798">This handbook explains the installation and use of & knetworkconf;, a module for the & kcontrolcenter, which allows to manage network interfaces, routing and DNS settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolcenter; allows the user to manage a range of system and desktop settings via a unified, integrated interface. the & kcontrolcenter; can be accessed by selecting K Menu kcontrolcenter;</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf; package is designed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the & kcontrolcenter; the areas of & knetworkconf; create a simple interface for the user:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation, a new module network settings will be displayed at & kcontrolcenter; the network settings module (knetworkconf;) can be run through selection of kcontrolcenter; Internet & Network network settings in & KMenu; started.</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetworkconf; network hardware cannot install. physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured in a fully functional way.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and set up during installation & Linux. if network devices are added later, the drivers must be loaded by adapting the following files depending on the kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The network settings module will be loaded when the network settings option is selected at the & kcontrolcenter; -Index. when starting the module network settings, this tries to automatically detect the platform used on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be detected, the manual selection is offered. it is the platform to choose from the list that best meets the distribution and release status. selecting the setting of non-re-polls can be permanently fixed. when the network settings are started, this selection will be automatically set.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings is possible only in system administration mode. before, all options are gray, meaning the settings can only be viewed, changing is not possible. in the system administration mode, you can enter the system administration mode at the right bottom of the module. it is necessary to enter the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">The entire functionality of the module is available in the system administration mode. it is divided into three tabs:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The tab Network interfaces can be used to manage the network devices of the system. all available network devices are displayed. from the tab Network interfaces, the following tasks can be performed:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The network interfaces displayed by default can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button interface... in the dialog box can be edited.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. click the Advanced Settings button to show the dialog with further options.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The automatic mode uses TCP / IP settings from a DHCP server or BOOTP server. in automatic mode, the TCP / IP settings for the system are done at the same time with the start of the system services. the DHCP or BOOTP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information for each system start, so no further setting is required. in the selection list, either DHCP or BOOTP, according to the system, can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2812">With the option Manual can be done without dhcp or BOOTP the TCP / IP configuration. in the input field IP address the desired TCP / IP address must be specified. in the input field netmask the subnet mask must be specified.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this setting is selected, the system initializes the network interface while booting. if the initialization is not desired, this option should not be enabled.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used. the input of an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict. ping in the & Console; you can determine if the desired address is already in use. in doubt, the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices can be activated or turned off according to your needs. switching on an outdated network device can be activated by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface....</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network devices can be activated or turned off according to your needs. turn off an enabled network device by selecting from the list and click off the interface...</seg>
<seg id="2818">Specifies the IP address of the host in the local subnet, which communicates the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with hosts in other subnets.</seg>
<seg id="2819">If there is more than one network interface on the computer, the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is located.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A computer with DNS support replaces a full domain specification through the corresponding IP address. this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses. if the host calls http: / / www.einedomain.org, DNS solves this name in an IP address such as 123.45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The name resolution calculator is a simple management of this list. entries can be added, removed or changed. DNS records can be sorted by selecting an entry and up or downgrading in the list with the Hindi or Herb buttons in the priority.</seg>
<seg id="2822">By clicking the button Add... from the group machine to the name resolution, a DNS server can be added. it will be displayed the New Name Server dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2823">First you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button. the entry will be inserted in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2824">From the group machine to name resolution, select an entry and then click the Edit button.... it will display the Edit dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2825">The list of specifically known hosts describes the name-to-IP address links for the TCP / IP subsystem. it is primarily used when booting when there are no DNS servers available. in small, enclosed networks, it can replace DNS server.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Normally the list of specifically known hosts contains some entries that support & apos; localhostapos; and some special IPv6 addresses. this still in the test version of IP is to replace version 4 in the future.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Enter the IP address of the known machine and click Add.... the Add New alias dialog will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2828">Enter the name of the known machine and click the Add button. if the known machine has multiple alias names, press the Add button repeatedly and enter the alias names.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Select an entry of a name that is known by name from the list and select Edit.... editing your machine is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2830">It can be performed one of the following tasks, then by clicking on OK the list of static hosts will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The settings made in the network settings are not immediately active in the system. in order to activate the changes, the following command must be set in a & Console.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The homepage of & knetworkconf; is http: / / knetworkconf.sourceforge.net, from which you can download the latest version of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2833">The installation of binary distributions (usually rpm packages) is sufficient if & kde; and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the ready compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a & Console; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a tool with graphical user interface such as kpackage or the installation tool of your distribution can be used.</seg>
<seg id="2836">In this case, the installation of Qt and & kde is sufficient, but additionally the development packages are needed with libraries and others.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended only to experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile & knetworkconf; the following commands should do so.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information about basic network technology will be given. in the second section, all of the configuration files are discussed by & knetworkconf.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This area cannot replace further knowledge of IP networks. in this appendix only basic information about the integration of the PC is provided in a small (home) network.</seg>
<seg id="2840">IP networks are currently operated with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv5 has never been widely used. IPv6 is expected to continue in the near future. therefore, this description is currently focussed on the widespread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is the knowledge of the IP address of a network interface. in foreign networks, at the & eg; workstation, the network administrator is the contact point where a valid IP address matches or if available, DHCP can be used. in any case, the IP address cannot be chosen arbitrarily!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up your own small (home) network, the IP address should be selected from a reserved area specifically for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global (Internet) network. addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet, so any use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the internet can be enabled for such machines by setting a gateway.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, addresses in the range from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254 are usually used. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0 so that all computers are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first one is the so-called default route, the second is the loopback address (localhost = your own machine). the default route is required for IP forwarding.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine. normally the address is assigned 127.0.0.1 of an own so-called loopback interface that works like a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">This section contains the configuration files that are affected by & knetworkconf and where they are stored in the various distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes changed dynamically in DSL links, so it will not be surprised if there is another content to be found there in the case of active DSL connections.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE; it is known that this file is accidentally sorted by the scripts in SuSEconfig. another stand than expected can therefore occur.</seg>

<seg id="2901">A strip type must be formatted before you can be used to store data. this procedure does not correspond to the formatting in & kdat; this does not correspond to formatting in & kdat; it needs to be formatted before use. floppy tape drives usually require formatting of tape, but DAT drives do not.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the band name and capacity is going & kdat; with the formatting of the tape. all data on the tape is lost! after completion of the formatting process, the tape is automatically mounted and ready for use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you start the backup process, you must select the files to be secured. this can happen in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. only this file or folder will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Select a backup profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Select files in the local file tree with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Right-click on the local file tree and select in the Save menu...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup has been started, the Settings dialog will open. in this dialog you can once again check the selected files and change the settings for backup.</seg>
<seg id="2909">The dialog will display the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive. it will only check the selected file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a check. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Right-click on one of the archives and select the item Insert...</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the check procedure has been started, the dialog for Review will appear. in this dialog you can check your selection once and change the working folder for the check.</seg>
<seg id="2914">If you have confirmed the settings for the check, the dialog appears. this dialog shows the progress of the audit process as well as the data throughput and the time remaining.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you can initiate the restore, the files to be recovered must be marked. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives that are part of the tape drive. only the selected file or subfolder will be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the files you want from one of the archives with a check box. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Right-click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Restore....</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the restore process has been started, the dialog window will appear for recovery. in this dialog you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for recovery.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Once you have confirmed the restore settings, the dialog will be restored. this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the time remaining.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it turns out to be necessary to recreate the band index file using the band content. this procedure deletes all existing index files for this tape. you can create the index on two types of tape:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings. you can make the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current working folder in which the backup should take place. the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the currently selected work folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders listed under backup files, only the files in it that are located on the same filesystem, such as the folder. folders that are located on other filesystems can be stored separately under backup files. each entry is considered by tar independent from the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform an incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files that have changed since then are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Delete the snapshot file before tar. this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file will be created for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of buttons files & gt; & lt; lt; files have not been fully implemented at the time of creation of this documentation yet.</seg>
<seg id="2929">You can set up the settings from the menu item KDat... in the Settings menu. you can do the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to the device node for the tape drive (usually / dev / tape). this path must point to the non-winding variant of the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2931">This setting is active, transmitted & dat; before the tape is mounted the command mt load to the drive. in some drives, this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is turned on, tries to lock the ejector from the tape drive. this setting may not work with all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is turned on, the mount will be discarded automatically. do not use this option for floppies.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is enabled, tries to change the hardware-like block size for the tape drive. not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter if this setting is active or not, you need to be & kdat; in any case you need to share the block size for your tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & dat; a tape is formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should only occupy a memory block on the tape. the contents of the file are composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n Byte) The volume of this string is the name: seconds, where hostname is the full name of the system on which the tape is formatted. seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the time in which the tape was formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the file $HOME / .kdat /.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The rest of the files on the tape are tar archives, which can be managed directly with & GNU; - tar. even other tar versions should work unless they are incremental backups.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the contents of a tape. this symbol is only active when a tape is mounted.</seg>
<seg id="2940">& kSystemlog; is a & kde; -Viewer for system logs. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system provides the various protocol files. in addition, & ksystemlog enables experienced users to quickly access information about problems that occur on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background. the task of & ksystemlog; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system leaves the various protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">Moreover, & ksystemlog enables experienced users to quickly access information about problems that occur on their server. & ksystemlog; therefore tries to provide some advanced features that allow filtering and evaluation of the protocol files of certain programs.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 has & kSystemlog; a number of useful features. these include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the syslog server and for samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and will be explained in the chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you can see in the following screenshots, make & ksystemlog; functions available with which the individual protocol lines of a protocol file can easily be filtered and sorted. the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start, & ksystemlog; first, the most important log file of the system - the system protocol - will open. instead it opens a small message window, so you have & ksystemlog; very probably not started with system administrator privileges. normally, the log files are usually found in the / var / log folder for normal users usually do not have permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter by a selected criteria or according to entered strings. the list of log messages is now automatically changed, so only log lines will be displayed. in the default setting a protocol row will only be displayed if the string of the filter keyword is contained in one of the columns.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select another entry at this point. the string of the filter search term is then matched only with entries in the corresponding column. for example, in the Protocol file system log, select the name of a process, so show you & ksystemlog; all log lines sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines. protocol lines of the level error are indicated by a more conspicuous color than log lines of the level note. the color representation of protocol lines can be turned off setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to show only a specific process (for example in the system protocol or in the Cron protocol), you can hide the process identification (PID) in the process column. this may, for example, be useful if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the Samba server. in this case, you can use filtering strips.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can select the To Add New Lines option from the main window contextual menu to display all the new log rows added.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& kSystemlog; allows to display multiple protocol files in separate subwindows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu to open and manage additional subwindows. as soon as you have selected a subwindow, select a subwindow in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& kSystemlog; has its own web site on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. You will find more information about the sources of & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& kSystemlog; also find in the following folder of the & kde; -Subversion archive: ksystemlog; in & kde; -Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and also called) as & ksysv; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv;</seg>
<seg id="2957">The system V Init is quickly becoming the standard for the control of the program start when the system starts up in the & Linux world. it is because it is easier to use, more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD -Init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further into historical aspects (e.g. because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is important because maybe someone might try to switch a machine on System V Init without installing a reinstallation and re-formatting. therefore, you must make sure that the old Init was removed from there if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init also differs from the BSD init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc instead of directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.d. Dort you will find rc.sysinit and the following additional folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a lot of scripts. basically you need a script for each system service you want to run when you run the system, or when you switch to another level. system services do not include such things as setserial, which is only started once. such calls are based on rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be under / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if there is not much use for it. you can also set up a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d, if you want to do something with the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel looks like init at different locations and starts the first one to find.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default Runtime is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following in the starting area:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the default runner is 3. if you want to change that, then you can edit / etc / inittab from hand and change the 3. if you have done something, then you can repair it by rebooting the system and executing the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start all the right scripts? if you type ls -l in rc3.d, then you probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no correct files in this folder. instead, each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How starts and stops init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop. you can actually start these scripts from hand on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if it contains a K, the script will be invoked with the argument stop. if it contains an S, the script will be invoked with the start argument.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people desire a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could have a server runlevel running only httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc; in addition, I could also have a user -runlevel, the & eg; & kdm;, Network & etc; starts.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or other pointer is simple to not tell trivial: simply drag an entry from the area of available system services to one of the six runlevels to start (or stop it).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between the level level or change the position within a level by dragging it somewhere else. this will only happen if you pull out an entry from the area of available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are moved if you drag them into a new area. to copy them to a new runway, you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert them into the target zone -- even if the same entry existed previously in the target zone of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sort number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you must edit the Sortiernumernumbers of the surrounding entries before you can re-attempt to insert the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: currently there is no way to restore records thrown into the recycle bin. be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tab key to activate the various working areas (Available system services, runlevel 1 start, runlevel 1 stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry to another level, move it into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and paste it into the desired runlevel with insert (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To manually change the sorting number or the name of an entry, press the button to open the Properties dialog. use the tab key to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all the entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. default settings are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise, they will be restored by & ksysv; stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I experimented with the standard runlevels, and now the machine is constantly restarted. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO Prompt linux single and press the input button to start in single user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default running level to a reasonable value (3 should normally be OK).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services with & ksysv; intended to run under running level X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only present in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way system services are launched in these distributions, simplifies the configuration for the proprietary set-up programs of these distributions but unfortunately does not meet any standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you use another distribution: please check if all configuration files are available that are required by the respective system service (and also if they are in the correct directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) simply exit without notice if their configuration files are not present or wrongly set up.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The meaning of the GNU / Linux; -runtime varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you use another distribution, please send me information about the runtime level so that it can be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & kuser, it is sufficient to read the chapter customization by & kuser; to read.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Once you have made any changes, you will need to save them. either use the respective icon of the toolbar or the Save in the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">The main window consists of two flashcards, the user and the user group list. to edit, select the desired user or group by double-clicking on the entry. it appears the user and group properties dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some flashcards are only displayed if you have advanced system settings. only if you have activated space restrictions (quota) for users, a card card will be created on which you can make individual settings. additional flashcards appear, if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd like in BSD-Unixes are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The card password administration appears, if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed like in BSD Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card only appears if for at least one built-in filesystem space restriction (quota) is enabled and initialized (recognizable by the file quota.user / quota.group on the file system). here, parameters can be changed for each user, whereby the space limitations are in KB:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set for each file system individually. the current filesystem is selected with the help of the field filesystem with space restriction.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The map groups inform about the group dependencies of the selected user. the standard group to which the user belongs, can be found in the Primary group field. furthermore, the user can be a member in other groups by marking them in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The Properties of the group contains a list of all users. to add a user to the group, mark that user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select Add from the user or group menu or click the appropriate Add button on the toolbar. editing or deleting the selected user or group works analog.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module you can install the LILO bootmanager, add, remove and change boot password, change the time until booting the default operating system, add the default operating system, remove, change operating systems, remove, change and more.</seg>
