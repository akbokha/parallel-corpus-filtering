although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012 , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extra@@ ordinarily great .
like many of my generation I grew up with American movies , have d@@ anced to American music , read American writers and practi@@ sed his sport .
in fact , this country had such profound effect on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film .
when he was 14 years old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican L@@ etter , a fear@@ less re@@ porter , who , with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts , uncovered the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of an oil magn@@ ate who wanted to occupy the supreme federal court with judges who were interested in his interest .
I was caught .
&quot; &quot; &quot; free after Method Man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was as if that is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona I only strengthened my admir@@ ation for the USA .
I always said , &quot; America is the only country in which I &apos;ve ever lived , whose diversity is so welcoming that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people .
I had even written a very black@@ ish love letter about his size .
then Donald Tru@@ mp came .
much was written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
the most unusual aspect of his ascension is for me how he deals with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
with his opinion , he never stops behind the mountain as you say so beautiful .
he says exactly what he thinks , as a former colleague puts it , and publicly declares his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , African @-@ American and women .
nevertheless , people responded to his statements and voted for him in dro@@ ves .
the 13 million votes he won in the Republi@@ can prim@@ aries was the highest number that a candidate nominated by the party ever reached .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ ot@@ est person , I asked myself ?
I couldn &apos;t reconci@@ le Tru@@ mp and his voters with the people I got to know during my time in Phoenix .
like my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program , which takes people from all over the world , a deeply believing person with whom I could talk about Islam and his past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also Tru@@ mp@@ s Welt@@ anschau@@ ung didn &apos;t agree with the current editor of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati Inqu@@ ir@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our shared love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; in the game .
Tru@@ mp@@ s Int@@ oler@@ ance stands in stark contrast to the gener@@ osity that I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who fights for the environment for her lifetime , and to her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like her son .
she is still adapting to the commitment of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life .
then there were Andrew Del@@ ey , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors whose wise counsel helped me a lot in my career .
these people and the values em@@ bodied by them deep@@ ened my love toward America .
while Tru@@ mp cleared his way to nom@@ in@@ ee Republi@@ can presidential candidates , they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America .
but it turned out that they were the exception of the rule .
on November 8 , 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly White , gave the pres@@ idency to a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people .
the confrontation with the idea that people voted for Tru@@ mp because they either shared his racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look those things , nearly broke my heart .
perhaps it is unfair to call the Tru@@ mp voters as ra@@ cists .
to categ@@ ori@@ ze people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is superficial and dis@@ respect@@ ful , and implies an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way .
it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
could it be that these voters , most of whom know , voted for Tru@@ mp because they want to regain control of a country that disappointed them ?
in other words , they might say that they are still important in this America ?
perhaps .
however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comm@@ its the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with cont@@ emp@@ t on those looking different from him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; white @-@ ash &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( note of the White against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Accor@@ ding to white vs. whi@@ plas@@ h , which means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trauma &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , as the great Van Jones ter@@ med , has killed exactly that which America has made so great . &quot; &quot; &quot;
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality , it is nonetheless a powerful idea - whatever faith or background one may have , America welcomes everyone .
for this country elected as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose history , as he says himself , would nowhere be possible anywhere else in the world .
however , with the election Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s , a vast majority of the white Americas made this promise and says : to hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 , the white man is back at the helm , they say .
in all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
on a manifestation for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tru@@ mp , would my son , Captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd responded with a loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd ro@@ ared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they answered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they cried , and their voices became lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would anyone not be like you , a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; NO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Khan included in the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tru@@ mp , it &apos;s not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the land for which his son fell , sent him a message .
this is Tru@@ mp@@ s Land now , said the news .
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , could not find a place in this new America .
and that breaks my heart .

out of the poverty to the stars : these Latin American children can &apos;t spoil their love for music by rub@@ b@@ ish

what does the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero Community in O@@ ax@@ aca have shared with the children of the Paragu@@ a@@ an city of C@@ ate@@ ur@@ u ?
the music played at both places not only changed children &apos;s lives , but also a very close link ...
music that lives with the apost@@ asy
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump , just 16 Kilomet@@ ers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial town that is popular among the tourists -@@ but worlds apart from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine .
for some years now , La b@@ anda de M@@ Ãº@@ sica ( Musik@@ ban@@ de ) plays in the community : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which has found a way to overcome the surrounding poverty with their musical instruments .
a music school with 100 students has become the central interest for the municipality of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the British newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the community , located in one of the poor@@ est provinces of Mexico , is known for its drug abuse and the gangs &quot; violence .
but this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered a rare gli@@ mmer of hope for the youth .
young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , writes the local press No@@ tici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
as soon as they come out of school they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .
you always come laugh@@ ing and with shiny eyes and play in the whi@@ r@@ l you learn day by day , trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ colo , clarinet , o@@ bo@@ e , flute , forest horn , tim@@ pani , bon@@ gos and the con@@ ga to play .
music from garbage
more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero , the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village located practically on the top of the largest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ Ã³n in Paraguay - on instruments made of recycled waste materials :
music with re@@ processed instruments made of local solid waste materials manufactured in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ur@@ u , where the recycl@@ ers under the leadership of F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ Ã¡@@ vez have begun turning parts of the waste into instruments .
the instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cel@@ los , double b@@ asses , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and percussion , all of which were produced from the tr@@ ash .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra etc .
in an article from the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ Ã¡@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and musician of the children of C@@ ate@@ ur@@ u , re@@ members the early days :
first it was very difficult because we had no room to rehear@@ se and we had to teach at the same place where parents worked in the garbage . children didn &apos;t know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them didn &apos;t live together with their children .
this changed as F@@ avi@@ o something that he had never seen before : a violin made of rub@@ b@@ ish .
today , there is a whole orchestra playing instruments made of re@@ processed material and which is called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra .
a documentation called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( harmonic land@@ fill ) records the musical performance :
the world produces about one billion tons of waste every year .
those who live with him and him are the poor@@ est - like the people in C@@ ate@@ ur@@ u , Paraguay .
and here they turn him into something beautiful .
fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspiring spectacle of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra even played his music before Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team@@ work can combat IU@@ U fishing successfully
photo Â© F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that comb@@ ats wild illegal fishing .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports on international , practical solutions to environmental problems .
re @-@ publication takes place as part of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for the joint use of content .
in West Africa , it was known at that time that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liberia , before it visited the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were accordingly upset and little inclined to welcome a criminal of this kind at their coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ ors , Mozambique and the Seychelles were rapidly mobili@@ zing against the ship . they refused to refu@@ te one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing permit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bene@@ dict Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior veter@@ an of the Ken@@ yan F@@ ish@@ eries Authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : it was not able to catch fish there .
finally , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia , because of the lo@@ oting of the country &apos;s fish stocks .
the core of this initiative that crosses criminal practices and protects resources was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , launched in 2012 by NGO stop Il@@ legal fishing ( stop illegal fishing ) .
in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are the six countries that were expelled from their waters at that time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded and work together . they exchange information and help each other , where it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust Project , En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , therefore it is extremely difficult to track down . therefore , illegal fishing is a main cause of over@@ fishing by regions .
the deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws , through which certain habitats and species are to be protected , can damage illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance .
but while actions against illegal fishing were once imped@@ ed by bureaucratic obstacles and also by the sn@@ ail pace , with the information between individual countries , the actions happen today in real time , with tra@@ ck@@ bar at F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
for example , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , news about susp@@ icious activities or details that were noticed or experienced during a harbour inspection .
fish @-@ i also draws attention to the activities of ships when they move on the open sea via satellite data .
this allows the authorities to identify ships that fish in forbidden areas . also , susp@@ icious road routes can be discovered , such as those suggest@@ ing that a ship loads his captured fish on the way to other ships .
ideally , such investigations can show whether the involved ships have a catch license where they were on the go and possibly if they have a criminal det@@ achment .
countries opposing illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such vessels in their ports , which means that ships cannot sell their cargo , and that they can even be forced to pay for pun@@ ish@@ ments , as in the case of the prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is then about considerable financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that &apos;s what we want to achieve , &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consultancy firm engaged in the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i .
a closed front line
the already mentioned platform was created to recover an estimated 20 million dollars of lost revenue , which the eight members of the H@@ ISH @-@ i network lose each year due to the illegal fishermen who inv@@ ade East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fish@@ eries in which the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world . among these are illegal fishing nets .
their practices include , among other things , activities such as sailing under false flag , fake license papers , ph@@ anta@@ sia seeds , fish protected species and fishing in conservation areas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they deliberately utili@@ se the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of a non @-@ g@@ un@@ ting organized control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , a ship could go fishing illeg@@ ally and a country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You &apos;re not running my port . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but another country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Come to Me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and this legal lo@@ op@@ hole is now trying to close F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
until now the closed front works .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 investigations of susp@@ icious ships .
it discovered criminal networks that had distributed fake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has persecuted and found escap@@ ing ships .
due to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international agency for comb@@ ating crime , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share and maintain information about illegal fishing over long distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organized crime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he builds a system that should help F@@ ISH @-@ i to pin@@ point susp@@ icious ships more precisely .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly being developed , also helps to detect the illegal ships that like to hide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fish@@ ers use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at tracking , an NGO which also deals with fisher@@ y data and provides technical support to F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships , for example , switch off their automatic identification systems , so they can no longer be ordered by satellites .
Cop@@ eland therefore helps build a system that connects different levels of information . it is intended to help F@@ ISH @-@ i to find criminal operating vessels with greater precision .
a model program
but can F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations actually influence the un@@ question@@ ably global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sun@@ Truth , believes that .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Marine Prot@@ ective Organization Oc@@ e@@ ana : a platform that provides satellite data and displays the position of each tracking ship worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with the neighbours to get a better picture of who is doing - it simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and to bundle their resources for investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this on a global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust has a similar project where a global system allows the persecution of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities not only detect criminals , but also sc@@ are them off .
ships that had previously been fishing without a license and had hardly any consequences , know now that they are being watched .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries involved in F@@ ISH @-@ i meanwhile have a 33 % increase in fishing sales , since fishing boats have been purchasing more licenses .
after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia had helped to detect Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors on board found tow nets where they were banned .
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ il@@ u says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have become an object of study . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2015 , six countries have joined forces , the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they are also comb@@ ating illegal fishing , according to exactly the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; Safety is the goal of creating even more of such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; says Cop@@ eland .
recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member state Somalia was able to announce its first major triumph : in October , it presented Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was under false flag . and not only was the ship travelling without a license and were used tow@@ ing nets , which are now banned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ship was also inv@@ aded into forbidden water reser@@ vo@@ irs that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking measures against Gre@@ ko 1 set a strong sign that they are against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ ISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time the evidence that such a special , collaborative approach to protecting the oceans is actually working in the entire world ocean . Emma Br@@ yce is a freelance journalist and lives in London .
their articles appear in the Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , the New York Times and the Guardian . situation in Venezuela continues to escal@@ ate : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of &quot; re@@ conquer the country &quot;
the road movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are considered a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on the removal of President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro .

after the government refused the opposition to a referendum on a referendum , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans , in whose eyes the negotiations on the country &apos;s political and economic crisis , ran into empt@@ iness by gathering in the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Te@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( for example : the order of Venezuela ) can be found both pictures of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them .
the debate will also be held in other parts of the country , including in the low@@ land area of Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ de@@ an regions MÃ©@@ ri@@ da and T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira , in the centrally located federal state of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the political and economic situation in the country is deterior@@ ating continuously , which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans through an acute shortage of food and medicines .
many of the representatives of the opposition saw in the ten@@ ure of the current President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro the chance of a fundamental change ; in the end , however , the reluc@@ t@@ ance of a new election was blocked by official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ Ã­@@ az , contribut@@ or to Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , sums up the context of the decision as follows in her latest article :
in the context of the social , political and economic crisis , in which inflation and violence are among the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated to be 500 % at the end of the year ) and in which a serious and far @-@ reaching shortage of food and medicine exists , the referendum was considered the only way to give the country the chance to rec@@ ap@@ ture its institutional structures and to establish a new government alliance .
the electoral alliance between Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democ@@ r@@ Ã¡@@ tica or short MU@@ D ( roughly : round table of the Democratic unit ) , in which opposition parties and political groups joined forces , called for a mass rally to support the National Assembly after the 2015 elections , as well as a march to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores palace , the Venezu@@ el@@ an government office , on November 3 , should continue the blocking of the referendum on the removal of the government .
the call was commented on Twitter among other things as follows :
it is as far as Venezuela : tomorrow National Assembly , Friday civil stri@@ fe and on November 3rd all to Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores palace .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the first demonstration in the framework of the action programme &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; took place on Wednesday , 26 October . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pictures of the mar@@ ches published in real time testify among other things an overwhelming participation of the people in numerous areas of the country , but also confron@@ tations with polic@@ emen and supporters of the government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one of the most commonly shared images shows a demonstr@@ ator calling through the shiel@@ ds , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Will you kill me because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you kill me , because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scre@@ ams this Venezu@@ el@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot;

on Twitter pictures are he@@ ap@@ ing about confron@@ tations , as well as reports of oppression and mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
particularly large waves struck the message about police oppression in the centrally located town of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves against the police and armed supporters of the government , according to their own statement .
hours later they could leave the cathedral safely , but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop police forces , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an State T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira :
the women in T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira carry no skir@@ ts , because otherwise you could see something that many National Gu@@ ards don &apos;t have !
meanwhile , an inf@@ ographic is already making the round that reflects the extent of repression per day :
so the dictatorship has oppressed the country .
many of the representatives of the government questioned the validity of the demand for a ban on ten@@ ure - it was now proven in the eyes of many people through the presence of countless people on the streets .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Lab@@ s added :
Nicol@@ Ã¡s and Di@@ os@@ dado claim that 1 % of the sig@@ natures are fal@@ si@@ fied .
here is your res@@ ignation !
on the street !
others analyse these protests as a further step in the fight against a government that has made little effort against the devastating economic crisis , rather than letting go of critical voices :
they took us so much - but also fear !
mar@@ ches are increasing in frequency and intensity .
some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported the media that they were too hungry to participate in a strike rather than to work or go shopping .

the interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to take a look at the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine@@ an city of CÃ³rdoba .
as a grown @-@ up man , Qui@@ j@@ ano now testified in the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial in the province of CÃ³rdoba , against his father .
in the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes committed during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship were investigated .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano did not choose his life .
starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations at La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
for 34 years , he kept the secret of family secrets .
in the situation at that time , I thought that was fine .
I felt like a secret agent .
as a child of 15 years you do not notice that you are manipul@@ ated by his father .
at that time I could not realize that my father was a th@@ ief , tor@@ turers and mur@@ der@@ ers .
Luis did not have a choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was a gendar@@ mer@@ ie . during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father was deputy commander of the intelligence department 141 in La Per@@ la prison .

his story points out what great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose for himself a way of redemption .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father started taking me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall with us . there I was friends with a boy who made martial arts .
they all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and asked me to identify my friend on it .
he said :
you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you have friends with one of the ERP .
make sure you don &apos;t have to kidn@@ ap you one day and then I &apos;ll have to save you .
the abbrevi@@ ation ERP is for Ej@@ Ã©r@@ c@@ ito revolution@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , a revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the revolutionary workers &quot; party of Argentina .
that is why he for@@ ba@@ de me to go to the gym again . a few days later , he took me to work on the military base .
he told me I would become a secret agent .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be ok , because my father had educated me .
at the military base , I had to destroy papers that had belonged to the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , simply everything .

on the other side the prisoners are tor@@ tured
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la - all in 1976 .
during the first and last time he left me at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he ordered me to get off . he led me to a bar@@ rack , in the cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - everything possible - stood .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a small pack@@ et wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big l@@ ump of silver in it .
on that day I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks , where the stolen items were turned off and kept me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
I went in and saw a couch that men were tor@@ tured .
she looked like a field bed and metal springs .
later I found out that they fastened it to the end of a cable . the other end was fastened to the body of the person that was tied there .
they un@@ le@@ ashed a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs on the bed , poured it over with water and drove him to the gen@@ itals of 220 volts .

the sten@@ ch there was app@@ alling ... like a dirty whi@@ rl@@ wind .
years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came from his room .
I immediately recognized the smell again and I realized that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I asked myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How is it possible for someone to harm another so much suffering ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ i know that these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were tied up with cu@@ ffs and were wearing eye chains .
he spoke to &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ Ã³@@ pez , a civilian who was also accused of trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked men were lying with the face down - all were tied to hands and feet .
near the entrance , people ch@@ ewed sil@@ ently on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father noticed I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you look like , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why did you bring me down ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers .
I know this because my father told me at home .
besides La Cu@@ ad@@ ra there were some rooms that were designated as offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rom@@ ero lived there and killed a man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( according to the testimony of survivors , the Zi@@ vi@@ list Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also accused of the La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial , the student Ra@@ Ãº@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death ) .
in the following video , Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , head of the La Per@@ la Memorial , runs through the former torture chambers .
the way you came in here is also the way where the kidn@@ apped came here .
when you look at the map , you will see that they took about this route and were tor@@ tured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ ization .
when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came to be laid .
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of men and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; War Gra@@ il &apos;
my father brought home all kinds of stolen things .
at that time I had no idea what the &quot; war prey &quot; - as it knew it - was .
but when I was myself in the military , I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that war boot@@ y is a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military badges , which one takes away from an enemy that has been fought .

but if one goes into a house and the refrigerator , the turn@@ tables , clothes , paintings , money ... ste@@ als , then this is not a war prey but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I have always wondered how my father , the leader of the security forces , could participate in this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand it .
I was also an officer in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never have liked to enter into a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; once he called me a criminal , and I answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; And you who steal cars on the street ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
he explo@@ ded with rage , struck me and cried :
if you go so far , then I will find you and kill you .
we don &apos;t need anyone else !
this is how my father was .
I have no good memory of him .
when I was in the process , I showed a photo of then , on which I wore a jacket and a pul@@ lover jacket made of wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still brought clothes home .
at that time , the defence accused me of being a con@@ spir@@ ator of this crime . I replied , no problem , they can lay my burden on what they wanted .
anyway , I was there to testify .
&apos;@@ the disappearance of the body is the last ab@@ hor@@ r@@ end@@ ous act &apos;
now , where I am older , I find re@@ mor@@ se .
I have children . once you have children , you can recognize the value of a life .
one develops further and real@@ ises that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , you executed people during the dictatorship . but what the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ?
why kidn@@ ap children ?
one day my father brought a girl home to her mother , whose mother was killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl .
I repeatedly asked myself : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
it would have been easy to put them into prison .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but why their cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ?
did these people not even have families to whom to hand over their mort@@ al remains ?
the disappearance of the body is the last ab@@ hor@@ rent act that one can do to a human being .
my father told me when the democracy was re@@ introduced , they took machines to eliminate the mort@@ al rem@@ nants of the prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they were crushed and dispos@@ ed of - no idea where . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but something always remains .
&apos;@@ i have seen how you killed people ! &apos;
only to clarify : I have nothing against the military .
I was even myself in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 criminals , including my father .
the thought of showing my father originated during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I repro@@ ached him for all the atro@@ cities that I had to experience because of him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt in@@ war@@ dly rep@@ elled and asked me why all the exagger@@ ated patrio@@ tism and the &quot; western and Christian feelings , &quot; which they allegedly defended , were actually good .
then I cried :
how can you tell me something like that ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes and you have forced me to join me as a child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , then tell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
in 2010 , I made the first advertisement .
I finally realized that he was a criminal .
no one can reproach me that I am pre@@ ju@@ dic@@ ed . finally , I have spoken out against my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest pending before the end of the trial .
he was charged with 4@@ 16 crimes , including severe , un@@ lawful de@@ priv@@ ation of liberty in 158 cases , torture in 154 cases , murder in 98 particularly severe cases , torture with subsequent death in five cases and a case of kidn@@ apping of a child under 10 years of age .

the judgments in the &quot; meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the size of the judgment in Spanish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial ended due to crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 against 7@@ 16 victims finally in August .
43 Supp@@ ress@@ ors were found guilty of crimes against humanity ; in 28 cases , the court depen@@ ded on life imprisonment and in nine cases sentences ranging from 2 to 14 years . in six cases there were acqu@@ itt@@ als .
eleven of the original 54 indic@@ te@@ es died during the trial .
# La@@ Per@@ la@@ enge : murder , torture and rape by officials . # Es@@ ft State terrorism
all the accused were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police officers and civilian employees .
Pier@@ o De Monti was kidn@@ apped together with his pregnant woman in June 1976 and transferred to La Per@@ la .
he addressed the following words to the Swiss Chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by un@@ human heads .
the Court of Justice is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations that have worked for years on justice for the victims .
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , lawyer of the Argent@@ ine organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , founded in 1995 , who represents the children of people who were murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said :
the trial lasted more than three years , but research for it took 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government passed the country on which La Per@@ la was located , so that a memorial could be erected there , which is now led by human rights organisations .

&quot; &quot; &quot; a translation error makes older people in Kyoto to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear@@ ful drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sign with the translation error at a center in Kyoto , where you can extend your driving license .
the photo was spread in the social media .
processing of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened center where one can pro@@ long its driver &apos;s license , witnessed a particularly mis@@ used translation in the last month .
on one shield , the Japanese word was the &quot; older car driver , &quot; fal@@ sely - perhaps but also with bad rear @-@ thoughts &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; translated as &quot; fear@@ some mot@@ ori@@ sts . &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself from September 1 to 20 .
processing of the original photo by Joshua Lev@@ ine , which has been widely shared in the social media .
the mistake occurred to the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also the one who drew attention to the local newspapers .
the Kyoto @-@ based daily Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how could it come to such an English translation ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an ins@@ ult to older people and in an international city like Kyoto just unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the faulty English translation was first removed . the term &quot; terrible drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; terrible drivers &quot; ) was later replaced by the appropriate name &quot; elder drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) .
the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture continued to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the translation errors . furthermore , it explained that the error was already contained in the text they received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for correctness before it was published .
a blo@@ gger told us about the ap@@ ology :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sincer@@ ely hope that older people felt offen@@ ded by inadequate correction ( translation ) on our part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Japanese online intelligence service J @-@ C@@ ast News became a bit more detailed with the phenomenon of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , there is a proportion of older drivers involved in accidents too , but for concern . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of 19,@@ 460 accidents were caused by sen@@ iors in 2005 , representing a share of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors caused 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of total 11.@@ 850 accidents .
this increased its share to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has decreased overall , the proportion of accidents caused by sen@@ iors has risen during the same period .
the named re@@ porter did comment in the version of the article published on Yahoo for light to show what prejudi@@ ces some Japanese apparently le@@ apt to older drivers :
the article on Yahoo for translation errors , among other things , received the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is this ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible mot@@ ori@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) not reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How faulty is the translation ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think that is a real translation error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not very few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a real treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre bugs in English .

the reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold .
to translate , you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the source text and use active language skills to translate it into the target language .
the latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . generally speaking , the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the pron@@ unciation of native speakers .
for example , a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from the French into English .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies employ no staff with English as their native language , which could be translated into English . this may be due to lack of understanding of translation , cost reasons or the relatively small number of English native speakers who learn Japanese .
some companies that do not have foreign employees can nevertheless produce translations within the company . then the Japanese employee , whose English knowledge is considered the best , is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
the verb@@ ati@@ m and en@@ ig@@ matic sentences , which are produced by machine translation , show that this technique can &apos;t replace a human translator for a long time . this is particularly true for some languages .
some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the pu@@ zz@@ ling im@@ prints , which often decorate t @-@ shirts or bags , are only used for styli@@ stic reasons - not to be read or understood .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be acceptable as jewelry or at least harmless . however , from large companies or governments that have the means to guarantee higher standards , more careful translations can be expected .
in the future , the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a serious source for its translations .
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ orship measures on the internet and television
home page of the website &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( Free surfing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute of Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , 7 April , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users reported that they had no access to the online channel Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay .
later , other users wrote that the internet appearances of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Cap@@ it@@ oli@@ o TV were no longer accessible .
other online channels also over@@ took photos of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as , organized by opposition groups , resist@@ ing the government of Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ u@@ ros .
the protests started in early April after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the role of parliament to the executive and the Supreme Court .
Luis Carlos D@@ Ã­@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the link was known and recommended the users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# Zen@@ ith : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that web pages of Venezu@@ el@@ an providers are once again blocked .
this is from the page of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
traditional media have been reluc@@ tant to report protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission for Telec@@ ommunic@@ ations threatened them with fin@@ es and closures if they continued to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as a &quot; call to violence . &quot;
without cable TV and informative national TV channels , I registered again at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
it is amazing that it is still cheaper than buying two liters of lem@@ on@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ IF later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay is in@@ accessible by blocking the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online channels . this also applies to the Internet site at which the National Assembly transfers its sessions .
earlier research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had revealed that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique whereby the DNS server requests to answer questions of certain domains correctly .
if a web site is blocked by the DNS , the server responds defective or refuses to request a query on such a website .
we confirm a DNA lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third locked channel , the broadcast was set on Thursday , 6 April , when the V@@ PI@@ TV cam@@ er@@ aman El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who transferred the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live , was taken into custody .
Flor@@ es was beaten while he was in police custody .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went on stream again .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , the government has also reported that the government regul@@ ates the Internet connections , making it increasingly difficult for Venezu@@ el@@ ans to gain access to multimedia coverage of the current events in the country .
in Paraguay , many girls become slaves to receive education
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a cri@@ m@@ ta as a child . now she visits the house in which she worked for years .
today T@@ ina fights for the rights of children and collects testim@@ onies of other cri@@ es who have been victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated version of a report by Struc@@ tural , which is published by Global Vo@@ ices with kind permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Esc@@ u@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en , &quot; which is edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices in Latin America .
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family living there .
shortly before gradu@@ ating from the university she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the one who has become something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she became ten years old she began to work as a cri@@ m@@ ta for the family . in Paraguay she describes more than 46@@ ,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the business is quite simple : a large family with little money over@@ passes their under@@ age son or their under@@ age daughter to another , ri@@ cher family . in exchange , the child receives food , training and a roof above the head .
what is not mentioned , however , is that the children have to do countless days of house@@ work that can never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all this within the framework of a treaty you cannot lift .
the practice described as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is widespread in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organisations .
after gradu@@ ating , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization fighting for the rights of boys and girls .
she spoke with cri@@ m@@ ta - especially young girls affected by the practice of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and den@@ ounced .
she tried to call things by name , because the feeling of thank@@ fulness that is in@@ oc@@ ulated by the cri@@ m@@ ta is generally guaranteed to remain silent .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
on the one hand , the family who is their daughter in the belief that she can complete her training , improve her position in society and &quot; make something out &quot; can be transferred to another family .
on the other hand , the family who takes the girl with him and justi@@ fies its exploitation with the belief that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and might even be star@@ ved .
victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will only learn about it many years later .
sometimes they never experience it .
in January 2016 , the so far unknown phenomenon , which takes place in secret in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen households , got a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n arrived in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ Ãº , her body showed signs of violent blows . shortly thereafter she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the home of the ex @-@ military Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ rei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as civil servant at the Einwohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt .
Mar@@ Ã­n lived with them in her house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ Ã­a , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometres east of the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n .
at the end of January 2016 Fer@@ rei@@ ra stayed with a stick on Mar@@ Ã­n until she suffered fatal injury .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later the media reported about the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a cri@@ m@@ ta .
organisations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the deep @-@ rooted practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go responsible for the death of the girl .
they called the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest demonstrations demanding that there could be &quot; no more Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widespread in the social media .
&quot; in Paraguay there are more cows registered than children , &quot; T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a compl@@ ained .
without papers , it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of the married couple and almost 60 civil society organisations called for spe@@ edy investigation of the case .
they want Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ rei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Cri@@ min@@ ta .
if the case comes before court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n may be pointing the way - for the first time in the history of Paragu@@ ays a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go comes before judgment .
the everyday life of a cri@@ m@@ ta
the Cri@@ min@@ tas are not only exploited as workers ; they also live isolated from other girls at their age .
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ mers , in which her father was working , had to sign up bank@@ rupt@@ cy and her father lost his work .
their brothers now had to work all the way and started selling sweets on the street or on the market to earn money .
but they all went further to school .
only T@@ ina was sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n as a cri@@ m@@ ta .
in the home of their employers Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours each day .
she had to share the time in such a way that she was still time to learn .
she rose up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared breakfast for her employer .
on Friday for example , she cleaned the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor .
when the school was finished , she went home again and had time to learn .
the sooner she finished learning the more free time she had .
but even this time was limited because they had to have dinner for their employers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but she didn &apos;t have unlimited food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was allowed to get more books from the master &apos;s library as a food from the fridge , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she recalls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ is@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , who was in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
at some evenings the hous@@ eholder Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced to stand beside him and read articles from opposition newspapers such as &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot;
he tried to convince them to give no faith to the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he considered it intelligent , but did not enter@@ tain with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the host had found someone who listened while he talked about politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they didn &apos;t often allow me to visit my family because they thought I would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; learn bad habits &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , which belongs to the indigenous group of Guar@@ an@@ Ã­ , would return home their mother tongue Guar@@ an@@ Ã­ . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their Lord feared that they would lose the education they had allowed them to lose again , they explained .
she was completely clear , however , that she had paid for everything she got from them , with their hard work .
also at school Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discrimin@@ ated against . &quot; one thing that is almost never spoken about is bul@@ lying and the har@@ ass@@ ment that cri@@ es are exposed when they go to school .
because the other children have parents , they immediately realize that someone who has no parents is a cri@@ m@@ ta .
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone to my home . I didn &apos;t have a circle of friends at school or in the neighborhood .

society appro@@ ves the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can share job advertisements for cleaning staff and nur@@ ses in Paraguay .
the administration of the group is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a municipal coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or in the district of As@@ unci@@ Ã³n .
Hello ! I &apos;m looking for a small companion for my little daughter , who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
learning to learn .
please contact us .
starting from Monday , if possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ad got five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and many comments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a woman from the village Ã@@ an@@ by wrote that she had an eleven @-@ year @-@ old girl and gave her telephone number .
another woman who came from Ã@@ an@@ by offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote .
the third comment was written by &quot; a girl from the inland that wants to work . &quot;
then the fas@@ cists in the ad switched back once more :
dear friends , I found one . I see if it works with her .
thank you , I write again when something is .
the shop was closed .
im the pro@@ lo@@ gue to the report Cri@@ min@@ tas , Â¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ Ã¡n@@ do ?
( Cri@@ min@@ tas , how long ago ? ) , a collection of testim@@ onies of former cri@@ es , writes Or@@ tiz :
in the course of our history we have managed to aboli@@ sh systems such as slavery , Cu@@ Ã±@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the pre@@ history of Paraguay ) and the Con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores ( where the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors had to pay tribute to them ) and the Con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores system ( where the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors had to pay tribute to them ) and that many girls and boys went into a system of slavery in which they become light victims of abuse and exploitation .
the social ine@@ quality in Paraguay and that of power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
bill adop@@ ts Egyptian users of social media to register with the government
picture of Pix@@ ab@@ ay , changed by Global Vo@@ ices .
posted in Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
sixty Egyptian parliam@@ ent@@ arians have recently approved a draft law on &quot; regulating the use and use of social networks . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when adopted by the Parliament , users of social media in Egypt must register with a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law a place would then be set up to allow citizens to use social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
within six months with the adoption of the law , users would have to register on the site of the site with their correct names and identity numbers to use social networks .
if it fails to do so , it could bring a penalty of up to six months of imprisonment or a fine of money .
the draft bill made up of six paragra@@ phs and cur@@ ated in local media including You@@ m 7 and Egypt Independent defines social media as &quot; any application running and being used over the Internet to communicate with others by voice , video content and text . &quot;
it is unclear how the law will be enforced when it is adopted , as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities should impose the registration . it is unclear how they should identify those who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure regulation at the level of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ du@@ l Satt@@ ar , MP and promot@@ er of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users received a username and password from the Ministry of Telec@@ ommunic@@ ations &quot; to pass through the fire@@ wall that blocks Facebook . &quot;
this could mean that Egypt plans to build a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . because of that it would be necessary for Egyptians and Egyptians to submit information about their identity in order to access the network .
but it is not yet known that such plans exist .
experts on site are scep@@ tical about the technical feasibility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; Senior Research Techni@@ cian &quot; ) at the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights , &quot; ) , Global Vo@@ ices :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I doubt the technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things related to technology . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in my opinion , they imagine that as they viol@@ ently control physical public and private spaces it could also be done online .
if I take it seriously , it means that they will establish a powerful surveillance system to filter citizens who request a permit or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor people &apos;s activities and also to bring them to a court case .
this is by no means realistic , but everything is possible in Egypt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed with the legislature of the Parliament and the constitutional committees before it goes to the plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether its acceptance and enforcement must be successful or not , the draft is in line with a pro @-@ military way of thinking in the Parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ized and ensured that no devi@@ ating nar@@ ration is present on the image surface , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
last year , the MP T@@ amer El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a legal document against cy@@ ber crime , in which a life imprisonment for those who were found guilty of threatening &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; protest &quot; in protest . &quot;

this article by To@@ d@@ d Reu@@ bold was published in the original on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that deals with international environmental protection solutions . the article is published as part of an agreement on content sharing .
high up in the mountains of the Kurdist@@ an region in the north @-@ east of Iraq , the animal rights activ@@ ist H@@ ana Ah@@ med R@@ aza and her team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq are working to protect the gh@@ ost@@ ly Persian le@@ op@@ ards .
a sub@@ species of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ards , which strikes through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ oph@@ ol@@ or ) . in total , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are endangered due to po@@ aching , loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat and since they find less and less prey .
why is this particular le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
as R@@ aza tells in the video , &quot; the Persian Leopard is the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ or in the Kurdish ecosystem &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem will also depend on a big pre@@ dat@@ or .
the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard actually in the wild is low and goes against zero . as the team in the video therefore states that they have a record of a big cat in the camera trap , R@@ aza breaks out in pure joy .
as a trained bi@@ ologist R@@ aza likes to show passion@@ ately another side of her country , which consists not only of war and conflict .
she has been involved in field studies on wild animals and educational programmes in Nature for six years .
since 2013 , it has also been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group and advoc@@ ates for setting up protection zones for wildlife in the Kurdist@@ an Region .

in early March 2017 , the daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , responsible for nor@@ theastern Japan , documented the progress achieved over the past six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the &quot; triple catastrophe &quot; in March 2011 . a huge earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an earthquake in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma caused the catastrophe .
K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , located in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ f@@ ecture . the Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ f@@ ecture was a pre@@ f@@ ecture in Japan &apos;s Nor@@ theast , which had to experience both the earthquake and ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to escape , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had entire coastal cities disappear from the map .
in addition , the pre@@ f@@ ecture Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma experienced a nuclear accident , alone because of this alone 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes .
from a local point of view , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o &apos;s special report shows what progress has been achieved six years later in order to rebuild the lives of local residents .
the detailed report of the newspaper covers both the statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority and survey results of those affected .
housing construction in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned surro@@ gate houses ( have been met in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate ) .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i recorded the greatest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , here 80 percent of the planned replacement @-@ houses were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such homes whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma is the final highlight .
at the same time , six years after the catastrophe , even six years after the catastrophe , the evacu@@ ation of accommodation establishments ( to be the first to be the first of them ) to settle into final replacement houses .
after the triple catastrophe , nearly 80 000 people saw themselves forced to live in shel@@ ters .
in December 2016 , 36@@ 0,000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate still lived in such homes .
nearly 40 percent of the evacu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma in 2011 still live in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful . more than 75 percent of the evacu@@ ees , who were living in homes after the disaster , were moved to final homes .
for I@@ w@@ ate , the figure is 34 percent here .
the state of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has been able to determine , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools affected by mis@@ fortune have opened their doors until December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is far more difficult .
while nearly 100 percent of the fishing har@@ bours in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation , only 30 percent of the fishing har@@ bours have res@@ um@@ ed their operation in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident resulted in large @-@ scale suffering in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agr@@ arian land .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 percent of the agricultural land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed ar@@ able land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
it is unlikely that this is just a consequence of nuclear waste , as only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of land destroyed by Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma are located in the &quot; nuclear barrier zone . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has recovered largely , but Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma still lag@@ s far away .
the tourist figures in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are again 90 percent on the same level as before the disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can only have 75 percent .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal dw@@ ellers , it is more difficult to earn their livel@@ ihood .
is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
in order to be able to determine the overall picture , the newspaper has conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacu@@ ees . she asked her about the state of re@@ building and how their feeling against the ts@@ un@@ ami risk has changed .
in her introduction to the article K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung explains :
K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the local population .
the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents took action to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of those sur@@ vey@@ ed find that there has still not been enough in disaster prevention .
how it stands for those who had to evacu@@ ate Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture
in its issue commemor@@ ating the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has also focused its attention on the situation of the evacu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had to witness not only the massive earthquake and devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma was also witness to the worst , disa@@ strous nuclear accident that Japan had ever suffered .
of 16@@ 0,000 evacu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , nearly 63 thousand people were transferred to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture .
at the beginning of 2016 , more than 23@@ ,000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , had been en@@ graf@@ ted into permanent substitute homes .
there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma outside of their home pre@@ f@@ ecture after 2017 .
in the disaster areas most of the evacu@@ ees who are still in Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ bel@@ shel@@ ters are older than 50 years old . they are well known because efforts to rebuild Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma compete with massive construction projects . these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo by 2020 .

when you meet people from other countries who speak a different language , the differences seem to be larger than the simil@@ arities .
after a while , however , one often real@@ ises that a more united than it seems at first glance .
these global connections are important as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices pod@@ cast , we look at these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep pod@@ cast , we deal with issues that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment when they felt very strongly connected with someone over language and country borders .

Brazil activ@@ ist in the artificial coma after being beaten up by the police at national demonstrations
left : the attack against Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva . photo : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z . publication with permission .
rei@@ ght : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva on a widely distributed photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit this week : last Friday , a police officer had beaten him with a stick against the head during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia . millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest march against austerity measures over the country .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , who studied social sciences at the University of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s , has suffered a traum@@ atic brain trauma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors operated him this Saturday and moved him into an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
the local image journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which spread quickly within a few days in Brazil .
on the pictures is also the face of the police officer who attacked with a stick . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s admitted that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended until the investigation of the incident from the active ministry .
the pictures show the police officer how he performs in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with his bat@@ on on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a police officer was beaten up by a demonstr@@ ator and landing on the intensive care unit , his face would be seen on television for six months and the entire repression would be justified with it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Facebook page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Des@@ neur@@ al@@ z@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , shared the video recorded by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z , in which one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and hur@@ ries several san@@ it@@ ators shortly afterwards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
another video with the same scenes , but filmed from a different perspective , is also immersed in social networks .
in the clip below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
for the Mat@@ eus family living in another state , Internet users have now donated 10.000 Brazilian re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover part of the costs of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia while he is hospit@@ alized .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .
against police violence . &quot;
the drawing was shared several times in social networks .

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s :
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s experiences a wave of political violence : here the activ@@ ist Guil@@ her@@ me Irish has been killed by his father , because he has sab@@ ot@@ aged the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools , and here we have the very sad case of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , who is on the intensive care unit , after he was attacked by a polic@@ eman who struck him with a bat@@ on .
police en@@ cro@@ ach@@ ments
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s was not the only state in Brazil , where last Friday it came to brutal police operations against demonstr@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot;
police officers sat at protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had set up a stage for or@@ ators , rubber @-@ fin and tear gas .
the deputy Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , the Socialist and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to refrain from violence against demonstr@@ ators .
this also includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the country .
once again , the Brazilian media covered road protests by focusing on another unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window pane .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo were specifically reported on a broken glass window in order to make a photo of their front pages illustr@@ atively .
on the other hand , O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a brand set on fire .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window of windows than about the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a special cause .
this must also be acknowledged if you are strictly opposed to any form of material damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; here too , the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gets an absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate meaning , and the typical acts of violence of the military police are concealed by head@@ lines with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prot@@ esters on confrontation with the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
villages forgotten by the indu@@ str@@ alization of Cuba in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Ã@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in all of Cuba included the doors ( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the popular Municip@@ ality Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cub@@ an province of May@@ an@@ que , is generally known as El Central - on Spanish sugar mill - not@@ withstanding that there is no significant sugar harvest on site .
it was two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane factories were paraly@@ zed .
after planting the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the ru@@ mo@@ urs of steel and concrete remained .
about 27@@ 2 workers had to re@@ inv@@ ent themselves .
some changed the job .
others res@@ ig@@ ned and commu@@ te daily to the factories which still ground .
N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an , who rises every day at 4 : 00 am , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ b his sleep .
he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region , which are in operation after a long in@@ active period , because they have been preserved .
that was something he did not expect .
N@@ ene re@@ members to have heard that in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry has already resist@@ ed pl@@ agues , the fall of socialism , low market prices , in@@ efficiency , poor management decisions and climate change .
in 2016 , production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the amount produced in the 1910 .
the message would have been a motive for concern for the country a few decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are no longer a novel@@ ty .
why was the Cub@@ an sugar cane industry turned off ?
the old railway platform of the municipality saw better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically out@@ dated , and hardly competitive in the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production objective was 4 million tons .
they left only the factories that could produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution to unemployment ?
the motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
nevertheless , the sugar price rose again about a decade ago .
from 2017 to 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the report published in 2016 by the OECD and FA@@ O , the United Nations Agricultural and Food Organization .
if present production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the export of raw sugar would generate approximately 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will certainly go into history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were the first words of the Cub@@ an President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on October 21 , 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from then on , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
in the following years the shut@@ down of 98 sugar cane factories came into existence , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further education .
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ Ã©e Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich on May 14 , 2004 .
Luis Alberto PÃ©@@ rez has worked in the factory since 1967 .
when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , speaks about the closure of the factory , is the word he repe@@ ats most often , &quot; sc@@ am . &quot;
almost all those questioned agree : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
in order for the place to be preserved , they formed a full @-@ time working group .
before the first closing @-@ year , the first letters began to come .
these were officially written documents , which were only differentiated with regard to the parts which would be removed , addressed to the add@@ res@@ see and the date .
all were signed by U@@ li@@ ses Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal .
from then on , the responsibility was transp@@ os@@ ed and the letters were getting more and more frequent .
Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the shut@@ down of the factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane factories which were still in operation , &quot; he asser@@ ts .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years old , is waiting for retirement in another facility , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was involved in the shut@@ down of the factory at which he was built .
with every part he removed , he dis@@ mounted one of his 31 working years .
the best developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important work de@@ pot has been eradic@@ ated .
in many cases , there were no alternatives to the jobs and services they generated in the communities in which they were located .
we will never know whether during the Mamm@@ oth speech of October 21 , 2002 , the then President saw in the eyes of the people present when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would go well .
the price of the population for the closure of sugar cane factories
since 2004 sugar cane has only been extracted by milling .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
after two years the Municip@@ ality Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory closed , or rather , when they began to mo@@ urn it , they also stopped asp@@ hal@@ ting the road , this dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms .
without work in the region , and with even advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look for other factories .
they became spare parts .
without prospects for the future , many young people left the region .
a food factory has been created in the area , and production does not even serve to supply the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
at the end of 2016 N@@ ene came back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work .
forty @-@ nine harv@@ ests give the old soldier a pension of two thousand p@@ eso per month to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich .
Mr N@@ ene , a man of black skin colour , small , with a few teeth and clear voice , is not a tra@@ verse person , yet he does not forgive the lies you were told .
they have been tor@@ turing him for ten years .
N@@ ene goes to pension at age 65 , not because it lacks strength , but because he is bitter .

youth of the First Nations Communities throughout Canada deal with topics that are important to them . they do this by means of hip @-@ hop , thanks to a series of hiking workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an Tour , workshop leaders have been bringing workshops and youth centres directly to schools and youth centres since 2014 in order to teach song writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were led by the ped@@ agog@@ ue David H@@ od@@ ges , who lives in Montreal and worked in North Que@@ bec with ten Cre@@ e communities and then worked together with the Cre@@ e Hi@@ p Hop group The Nor@@ th@@ Stars .
the workshop is thereby increasing that the young participants explore topics such as &quot; cultural identity , language , debate , love , self @-@ acceptance &quot; or whatever comes to mind .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the protagon@@ ists .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations Communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organise similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ni@@ b@@ ago in Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of T@@ ears , &quot; a stretch of street in West kan@@ ada , where almost two dozen indigenous young women disappeared or were murdered .
most of the cases were not solved .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey the importance of preserving traditional customs and customs despite the influences of global@@ isation .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people did not dominate the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song the Wh@@ ap@@ ag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation has recorded , the chor@@ us is sung on Cre@@ e .
the young people involved were given some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly by the Nor@@ th@@ stars Hi@@ p Hop group , who gave them a drop in the Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e dialect .
on the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ ks@@ eite of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an the stan@@ za is available in tran@@ script , as well a translation into English translated here into German :
sometimes I feel like nobody ever is interested in me
but I try to continue my days on Earth
that is the day when you will take our cry
because as a youth we have lost our way in life
but I believe we will rise one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
this is how they can grow and do our youth as well
this is how they can do what they intended for the Creator .
in the commentary part , the reader and advoc@@ ate of Cre@@ e language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also contributes and adds the stop@@ per in sy@@ ll@@ ab@@ ia ( which is also published on his blog and is published here with permission ) :
in Japan , plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant

in Japan it is possible to see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant .
to show potential customers exactly on the menu , close to the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ ier@@ u ( to be the &quot; dishes of the dishes &quot; ) are exhibited by every dish served in this restaurant .
customers will see these plastic dishes and decide whether to enter or continue the restaurant .
there is an entire industry devoted to the production of these plastic dishes .
in the city district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , there are a large number of these small companies that produce those plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are so common that they don &apos;t even notice them anymore . however , a new trend turns them into most eye @-@ catching mobile accessories and other gad@@ gets .
at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i published series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ rab@@ u .
now in special sale : new hand@@ cu@@ ffs decorated with plastic dishes , as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these artificial foods were turned into kit@@ sch@@ y collecting objects , as in this case , fridge magn@@ ets :
here are a few sho@@ ot@@ ings of fridge magn@@ ets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new Boom of Essen@@ ti@@ als is becoming more and more complex .
in this case a ka@@ ise @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) was transformed into a cell phone stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a cell phone stand .
also this part we made for the exhibition at the Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple that keeps your mobile phone holding :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is a great design .
and that is just the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic .
some cell phone boo@@ kl@@ ets and mobile phone designers allow you to create your own artwork . in this case , i@@ kur@@ a or Lach@@ s@@ rogen is used , a popular t@@ opping served with white rice .
on Twitter some users had their doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is someone who would say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now I can decorate my cell phone with salmon che@@ ats ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I &apos;ll be the only one .
this interest in plastic courts can also take a less appe@@ ti@@ zing form to surprise colleagues or family members un@@ pleasantly .
our latest Handy @-@ stand has the form of mel@@ ted ice .
in addition , there are also rice balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , earrings and w@@ rist@@ bands made of dried salmon .
for more bizarre plastic dishes you can look at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # .
if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , then this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually made .
a Mexican project tells the stories of the survivors of the fight against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of the fight against drug dealers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in reports of domestic and foreign media about the in@@ famous &quot; struggle against drug traffi@@ cking &quot; in Mexico , the missing and dis@@ agreed regularly only appear in statistics . these , however , do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle ent@@ ails .
the reports on drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ Ã¡n , the head of the Sin@@ alo@@ a Cart@@ el , completely forced the stories of the victims of the conflict into the background .
the day after a violent incident , hardly anybody looks at the ber@@ eav@@ ed or the communities who have learned to live with the pain .
behind each cor@@ p@@ se , behind each bone find in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never heal .
that is why the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico has launched the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; live with the drug trade &quot; ) , which tells these victims a voice and tells stories of people who were involved in the struggle between the law enforcement authorities and cart@@ els .
animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico describes the project like this :
organized crime not only makes us afraid of our lives .
the effects are far more profound .
for example , when shops close because they are threatened by drug dealers and entire communities need to travel many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk .
the pain of the victims
&quot; &quot; &quot; a video titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how anxi@@ ousness lives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) tells exactly these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who searches secret graves after his son every weekend .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ Ã­@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews in one single day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; priests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like every Sunday , we are again preparing ourselves for the task which we have set ourselves to seek and search for graves after the people we have loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electrical shop in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
he left the house on 13 October .
on October 15th , he was supposed to be back , but he never came back . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need training .
there is also my mother , who is also here with me .
at the moment she has no income .
you are entitled to the insurance of my father , but it does not pay them out because they require a death certificate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; where should we get it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must not only show the faces of those who fear . we must show the international community the conflicts , frag@@ ility and state leadership . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports from journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader of Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico .
your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal , no matter what form it occurs :
I have known disease and sensation@@ alism for several years now .
every day I come to the newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the front pages with pictures , which can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from acts of specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one that is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to that body .
I can &apos;t be in@@ different about it or consider it normal .
she continues to write :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old cous@@ in thinks he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealer ) if he &apos;s big . and it &apos;s also not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic deeds &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they go through the streets .
for me this is as if they ta@@ sted those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something like that happens to them .
I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a stati@@ stic .
people &apos;s inno@@ c@@ ence is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village can be justified with that they were &quot; so@@ aking . &quot;
I think they are trying to argue that they are spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies when they do not touch and remain silent .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the article &quot; Four Mon@@ ths Er@@ pressing in the Capital of the Capital &quot; : how a family was lo@@ oted by threats of money for month until they end up destroying not only business but also torn their family apart .
you think of everything that you have lost and how many people can completely change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain never passes , the trauma stays , the fear comes up again when you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers too .
we only contact you if it is absolutely necessary .
the far@@ ther we are from each other , the better .
she closed her report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they will kidn@@ ap you or kill you .
in those terrible days , I wondered if tears would dissolve my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I must learn to live with the pain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ Ã©r@@ rez Vega has published the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The For@@ gotten Children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez : a Generation of Viol@@ ence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the introduction , he raises questions like : who cares for the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime ?
how is it to grow in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care for them .
Br@@ yan is a orph@@ an and he tells him to teach himself how to cook an egg , fry potato , tor@@ till@@ as warm and make &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for preparing the bottle with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for each year of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - in@@ expres@@ sible for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood was past two years before , when he was just a few blocks from his home , seeing the bloody cor@@ p@@ se of his father , who had been shot by armed men out of a passing car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez looked like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 , when violence was mixed with the organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders according to the citizen &apos;s council for public security and government of the United States Government .
in 2010 alone , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office numbered 3@@ 103 mur@@ ders . this corresponds to 8.5 Mor@@ des per day .
these are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories behind organised crime in Mexico and inv@@ ade the soul of the country .
only a few stories continue to live in the face of new head@@ lines . however , this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico has launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose goal is to portra@@ y the complex information behind the failed campaign against drug traffi@@ cking , which has been tor@@ mented by the country over the past four decades .
when a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ strÃ¶m ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ MENT : this post and the pages to which he links , contain images on which violence is represented .
the fact check is important at a moment when it comes to lifting up a ru@@ mor or expos@@ ing a fal@@ si@@ fication .
but how is the years after something has appeared for the first time ? content in social media , whether it &apos;s true or un@@ true , tends to continue to exist .
let us take this photograph of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
since its first release it has been mis@@ leading to portra@@ y trage@@ dies that have actually occurred in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false coupling of image and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; wrong context &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample careful reporting on events in DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions about our desire for images to news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 , a tan@@ ker crossed the village of S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , ti@@ pped and explo@@ ded . 230 people died .
after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country was neglected for years and devast@@ ated . the streets in the region became dangerous trails full of po@@ thol@@ es which were difficult to navigate .
tra@@ gically , the tank truck fell victim to it .
government representatives described a fire@@ ball that envel@@ op@@ ed dozens of houses including a movie theater nearby which was full of people watching the World Cup .
houses burned and char@@ tered cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burnt to inno@@ c@@ ence .
a picture titled &quot; That is Nigeria . &quot; by Im@@ g@@ ur @-@ User My@@ sti@@ cal Mon@@ key , January 12 , 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident atro@@ phy the horrible scenes of this day .
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of stolen bodies that are str@@ ung on the ground while persons watching them .
but here history does not end .
over the years , the same photo was repeated several times on social media , blogs and other platforms and wrong@@ ly attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , comb@@ at@@ ants from B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nigeria towns of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
eye witnesses dramatically told the atro@@ cities they had to flee .
houses and shops were burnt down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one remained behind to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a citizen to Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many had been dis@@ member@@ ed , shot or burned .
only on the basis of satellite images the follow @-@ up time could be illustrated figur@@ atively .
the reason for the attack was also un@@ solved , but the Army base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ an and the attempt by B@@ oko Har@@ am to win land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture from the DR Congo appeared again , when it was fal@@ sely presented as evidence of the fact and possible extent of the attack :
that is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of false attri@@ butions . Africa Check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases , the picture was presented as a test@@ ament to mass kill@@ ings .
one step further further personal comments such as this example wrong@@ ly fal@@ sely reflect the image of the DR Congo with sources of the mass media in order to provide arguments .
the picture from S@@ ange appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a lightning announcement , published by the United Nations describes those who were able to escape blows , rape and several dead , some through burning .
while others reported of the violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts appeared like the following , bringing together these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news site , fal@@ sely claiming that President My@@ an@@ mar@@ s Th@@ ein Sein have said that monks and politicians would have participated in the assass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . additionally , she had used the image of DR Congo to portra@@ y this information .
the original contribution , which was accessed last April 26 , 2017 , can be viewed here .
other news organizations called AF@@ P as their source also wrong@@ ly attributed Th@@ ein to this statement , but did not have the image of the DR Congo related .
the worldwide range of false information
traces of these false stub@@ bles go back to the years 2011 and 2012 and actually come from all over the world .
using an &quot; reverse picture search &quot; you can see how far information can cross borders .
an inver@@ ted image search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 pictures below 18.@@ 8 billion pictures ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) , which are very similar to the said image from the DR Congo .
they come from a mixture of private sites , platforms of social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have passed false reports , some have attempted to expose fal@@ si@@ fications .
we have incorporated some examples of ab@@ u@@ sive use and associated them to the respective countries on the basis of which page they have been published on which page they have been published . thus , we want to show the range more clearly than by the language alone .
several examples of ab@@ u@@ sive use may come from the countries listed below ( which in some cases also have been inter@@ connected ) .
here are some cases which can now be fully detected ( on the map in orange ) :
map : News Fr@@ ames .
country examples of false coupl@@ ings of the image from DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange countries point to pages or servers that are still available through the examples of fal@@ si@@ fications or fal@@ si@@ fications .
the countries in grey are examples which , according to the metadata and information that are available through Tin@@ Eye , are likely to show fal@@ si@@ fication examples .
as a reminder , the source of the picture is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image of DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeri@@ ans and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread on the &quot; war of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot;

Iran , 2012 .
a federation of students of theology ( mul@@ l@@ ahs ) in Islamic countries published an open letter to support Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims on the news agency N@@ asi@@ m and used to illustrate the image of the DR Congo .
Italy , 2015 .
an inhabit@@ ant of the old town P@@ ie@@ di@@ ca@@ stell@@ o of Tren@@ to posted this news on his side to express his solidarity with the massacre in Nigeria in 2015 .
Nigeria , 2012 .
even within Nigeria the photo from DR Congo has been shared as a proof of the bom@@ b@@ ings of B@@ oko Har@@ am in K@@ ano in public discussion forums .
Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme examples of ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from the DR Congo , on the one hand a twe@@ eter expressing sympathy with the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre and on the other hand the attempt of a blo@@ gger , the claims that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are persecuted , because the photos were used impro@@ per@@ ly .
Myanmar , 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Myanmar government published a statement on what it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliberately contri@@ ved news and photos that came to international media , international human rights organisations and governments in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings regarding Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this adjustment , which has been published exclusively in English , also includes references to fake images of sm@@ ells used by H@@ ate Spe@@ ech and used by extrem@@ ist groups to demonstrate that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and vice versa ( which is often spread by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) .
Russia , 2012 . &quot; inflammation of the abdom@@ en of inflammation and inflammation &quot; ( Christi@@ an@@ opho@@ bia or political pro@@ vocation ? ) .
this post , addressed to the members of the Russian Orthodox Church , clearly shows that the image of the DR Congo does NOT show Muslims killing Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page wrong@@ ly claimed that the president of Myanmar Th@@ ein was admitted in 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the picture from S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the picture is still included in it .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 about students killed by B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the Catholic nearby An@@ Ã¡@@ li@@ sis Digital , has explicitly declared that the picture does not come from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it represents a &quot; similar jihadi@@ st attack . &quot;
when the picture later came into circulation in connection with the 2015 B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre , the newspaper El Pa@@ is attempted to refu@@ te that there were connections to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ Ä±@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ Ä±@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria is burning , the world is asleep ) .
the image of the DR Congo appeared on this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag and triggered a discussion among Muslims following the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am in 2015 and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve greater attention to those events that allegedly took place in the name of Islam .
United States , 2015 .
the picture was weather@@ ed as evidence of the massac@@ res of the B@@ oko Har@@ am in 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times res@@ cu@@ ed ) , but the messages that were associated with it were not taken up in any religious context .
instead , the aim was to pay attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage compared to Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Vietnam@@ ese ) , 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after a message allegedly written by a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an slaughter , there were discussion forums such as this here in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it a false report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the Embassy in which the picture was contained in the DR Congo , the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ ine Mission@@ aries and Fr . Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos dist@@ anced themselves .

( data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the craw@@ ler and occasionally they have educational data in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )

frames and images
there are two strong themes or frames ( fr@@ aming ) that go through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photograph was used with regards to greater discussions about the silence in connection with the kill@@ ings of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the mur@@ ders of Roh@@ ing@@ ya by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fr@@ aming uses the picture to discuss how an African life is under@@ estimated as compared to a European or French life .
to understand religion and the value of human life is important both . therefore , it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts .
a deeper question , however , is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images .
with social media , there are tens of people who in@@ ad@@ vert@@ ently share the water around a tragedy .
suggests this mood of false and false information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and nar@@ rows the actual horror of what actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the spread of violent images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
one argument is that ref@@ using images of a refusal will be the same as acknowled@@ ging the tragedy . sometimes these images are even requested by the victims themselves .
at the same time , the concern is that violent images des@@ ensi@@ tise readers and viewers and take the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which examined how violent media are working to help others ) .
while there is a lot to discuss in terms of violent views in the news media , it is a fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting .
techn@@ ologists are experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; fake news . &quot; they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something which can actually be detached from the context or in a completely impro@@ per way .
however , any investigation of false attri@@ butions should also take into account how international they can be .

the &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy Sim@@ mons is used in accordance with CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog named un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e. g. inv@@ alu@@ able ) tries to offer language @-@ inspired a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not to translate at all .
such words are in every language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these irre@@ plac@@ eable words are already well known today ( like the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) and others deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ b@@ mes@@ a ) .
but all resist any attempt of a simple translation .
a word or an expression is not enough , which is why a full explanation and sometimes something context is necessary to understand exactly what is meant with this one word .
these unique words have been collected in an online list for quite a while .
most of these lists cover Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages .
for example , in the blog you can find words from the Mw@@ ophone language of Van@@ u@@ atu , such as :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Bem@@ ba to your parents in recognition of how they have tried to keep you in your younger years .
and words in the H@@ uns@@ wick language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - Comfort or la@@ z@@ iness you feel after having war@@ med up in the sun on cold days .
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog about :
they def@@ use other cultures , reveal other thoughts and ar@@ ouse our curiosity .
sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page want to publish even more of these &quot; conf@@ using &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these little languages are .
speakers of the &quot; Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages , &quot; which are highly valued by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite words here .

how Sri Lanka eng@@ ages with the worst floo@@ ding catastrophe in the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood and earth disaster in this decade .
caused by the mon@@ soon , which normally commen@@ ces at the end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya have stepped over the shore in 15 districts in the south and west of the country .
according to a statement from the Sri L@@ ank@@ an cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es of 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and nearly hundreds of people are missing because of the floo@@ ds and mud @-@ av@@ alan@@ ches .
over 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and around 100,000 people were transported to 304 stainless steel locations .
rainf@@ all began on Saturday ( May 27 ) , and the water levels in some areas were slowly coming back .
health and hygiene conditions of the population are a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos convey an impression of the extent of the floo@@ ding catastrophe :
floo@@ ds in tap water of tap water of up to 7.5 m . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et deliver regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the disaster .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floo@@ ds wor@@ sen the crisis of Den@@ gue and warns Save the Children after more rainf@@ alls are already on their way .
this morning the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus stood in the high water , water level up to 6 meters . village of Mor@@ ago@@ da with G@@ alle also flooded due to the above @-@ beaten water p@@ eg@@ els of Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da El@@ a .
the Air Force has provided five air@@ planes for rescue operations and further five are completed to transport emergency supplies for the inhabitants trapped in their flooded villages .
different organisations and start @-@ ups have also decided to help .
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situations and humanitarian assistance .
if any search and rescue teams require dr@@ ones for their operations , please call the number 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 .
for those who want to don@@ ate dry food and essential goods for flood victims -
we are today in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call the number 07@@ 77@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 07@@ 77@@ 8@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if you need help in this area .
the Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) tax@@ i@@ u@@ u@@ f app asks people to share their location data with the help of the app so that the cad@@ a@@ stral center will be informed .
last year after the disaster of the Ro@@ an@@ u tropical storm , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; flood help &quot; button , which allowed users to call a vehicle to pick up assistance and donations . they were then transmitted to the s@@ ri@@ lan@@ k@@ ish Red Cross for free .
they also launched a &quot; S@@ OS &quot; key which resulted in more than a thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for people trapped by floo@@ ds and land@@ slides .
the combined efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , bring safety and assistance to residents in need .
this has prevented the loss of further lives , wherein the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to the restoration of norm@@ ality .

the Women &apos;s March on January 21 , 2017 in San Francisco .

in January , I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and dear friend .
I confi@@ de in her four years old daughter ; she confi@@ deth in me her children : she is my rock in the surf .
in the last minute we still call slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights .
in the next section we will issue rights for trans@@ gender .
we are located in a sea of umbrellas and people , some hold the iconic picture of a woman with a head@@ sc@@ arf , bound from an American flag ; others sk@@ ate slo@@ gans against anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; These things do not concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why because I am not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already taken this conversation .
people with whom I have been working or people who have known me for years are separating me - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims &quot; built up in their imagination .
they had to mi@@ tig@@ ate me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not all look the same .
we practice our religion differently .
we identify ourselves with being a Muslim in different ways . but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination , that as soon as Muslims do not fit into it , Muslims become Muslim .
removal of the muscles
I don &apos;t stand alone .
this has even happened to the poet whose poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what images do you have in mind when you think of him ?
love ?
peace of mind ?
as Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Qur &apos;an , and the Prophet Muhammad were the centre of his poetry until the day he died .
but in the Western sense , the religion of Rum@@ is was extingu@@ ished as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ eting makes a great deal of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims of this world .
another consists in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims who have been colon@@ izing Western books for centuries .
this entic@@ ing picture language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid destroyed the story behind these images in the 1970s .
but these pictures prot@@ ru@@ de even today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continued to ste@@ er them .
I have worked in the news industry for thir@@ teen years and I have seen how these powerful , flaw@@ ed Nar@@ r@@ atives dominate our news@@ feeds .
this narrative over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed the reality that nine Muslim women have led to their countries over the last three decades , while the United States could not even elect its first female presidential candidate in 2016 .
this nar@@ ration fails to recognise that when French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head@@ sc@@ arf in public buildings and forced Saudi , Muslim women by their government to cover their entire body , which both are two sides of the same coin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group exercises its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this strong narrative weak@@ ens Muslim women who lead movements for change .
it also overlooks the fact that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans who had been brought here with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of Que@@ er Muslims .
this narrative has taken our collective imagination so deep and flaw@@ ed that often Si@@ kh &apos;s and children are aimed at target@@ ing domestic attacks and har@@ ass@@ ment .
because of these stories , which we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not just fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; other . &quot;
to the 1,7 billion belong
in the news industry , we do more than just telling stories based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create narr@@ atives that help us understand the world .
and my industry has failed to capture the Nar@@ r@@ ative of 1.7 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and here we have failed , where seven million Muslims represent the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious group in America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a third of the entire Muslim population are African @-@ African Americans .
six of ten American Muslims are among the first @-@ generation immigrants coming from 77 countries .

back then , when Khan re@@ thought the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were ir@@ res@@ isti@@ ble Muslims and Americans .
but now I am not a Muslim and an American ?
sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of getting out of my Muslim recipes or carrying out my handy pocket basket that all Muslims wear - &quot; out of respect for P@@ epp@@ a W@@ utz . &quot;
I j@@ est , we do not carry all pocket kit@@ es with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t have to be the@@ ological experts to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or almost always be chosen for additional security checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists trying to combat widespread lies about Islam .
these lies are produced on the ongoing tape by a well @-@ forged anti @-@ Islam machine with credi@@ tors , think tanks and false information experts who have manipul@@ ated our already er@@ ron@@ eous picture of what a Muslim is ; or of what Islam is .
because of the stories we are telling and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is more than just a stranger that tears the head@@ sc@@ arf to a woman .

I would like to explain this .
I was born as a Muslim , but being a Muslim was only then born into my imagination when I was four years old , in a provisional mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social scientists describe religious life , they resort to the following terms : belief , behavior and belonging .
my Muslim faith and behaviour may not always be visible , but they are there .
perhaps my girlfriend , my neighbor , will see my rock in the surf that I am Muslim if she could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the evening ritual with my daughter if I held her silent in my arms and supp@@ ress the Arabic scriptures to protect them , which seal the Koran and called the Q@@ ul@@ s .
every one of them I repeat three times .
I ask that she is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see .
my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow .

belonging is the image of my mother , mat@@ ernal , with her sisters ; how they win a contest of the art of flower arrangement in Kar@@ achi for decades .
it is the picture of her that I see at this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by their finished and incomplete paintings of the Su@@ fi @-@ saint ; and a Qur &apos;an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters , which it can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze .
to be Muslims is to speak the prayers that she told me to speak when I have a bad day .
to be Muslims is how they taught me to relate to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord .
for a people who - over the centuries - was colon@@ ised by an empire , which has established a company with the name Hon@@ orable British Ost@@ ini@@ dien Kom@@ pan@@ ia , it has a deep meaning to name God , my only Lord .

belonging is to know that there are millions Kur@@ ds and Palestinians , whose families , as with my grandfather , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who have shared the Muslim world as at play risk .
to be Muslims is to know that over the last two centuries , Europeans have been &quot; colon@@ ized &quot; all the way to four Muslim countries .
it means to know that the first pilot bomb of history was dropped from a century ago over a Muslim country .
it means to know that at the same time the grandfather of my grand@@ mother , an Indian , ash@@ mir@@ i subject of the British empire , was referred to as &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time since he led the first mos@@ que in England .
even before there were planes , he travelled to more parts of the world than I ever was and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice .

it means to know that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is are buried beneath the ruins of the war .
to be an American Muslim means to know that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means to know that if a tragedy takes the US and the suspect bears a Muslim name , the story is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in .
it means to know that fourteen hundred years ago , the first call for prayer , the Az@@ ak , was called Bil@@ al by a liber@@ ated black slave .
it means to know that two hundred years ago an African Islamic schol@@ ar called Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this country .
it means to name Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .

being an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ist , a K@@ ash@@ mir@@ i , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Muslim and a journalist , den@@ otes the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple con@@ junc@@ tions , but fails to communicate them to others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the narrative of the 1,7 billion contains more possibilities than a magic cube , but is represented in the reducing sof@@ tness &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be a mother means to care for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged persons on this branch er@@ ect structural anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility .
structural anti @-@ Islam@@ ism exists in Muslim regi@@ str@@ ars , who began with President Bush and extended under President Obama .
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it consists in the immigration officer , who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child into hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it consists in a country that exclu@@ des its borders to people from just the countries that it bom@@ bed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No @-@ Fly @-@ List &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is largely targeted by Arabs and Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are the wars that we are carrying and the bombs that we are throwing away on Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of the stories we tell and because of those we do not tell , we are here today .
in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists at Nor@@ th@@ western University showed a scientifically wrong picture and asked them to evaluate groups on a scale of 1 to 100 in terms of evolution .

we stand back for decades to recognize the roots of our fears and the flaw@@ ed and dangerous im@@ prints we en@@ list in our news editorial offices .
at least there is a growing movement led by American Muslims in the media industry trying to capture our multiple with con@@ junc@@ tions and forgotten history .

and that moment has consequences which go beyond the 1,7 billion .

&quot; &quot; &quot; there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few years earlier , it had not yet existed ; now they dominate large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the realities and the story that I was not aware of when I was as old as my daughter is now , but who made me an un@@ think@@ able Muslim today .

we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of being consciously and un@@ consciously the &quot; other &quot; ; as my girlfriend and I did in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the occupation that we have no president , the chocolate cake , while he already bom@@ bed broken countries and &quot; made to other &quot; people , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion .
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for stor@@ yt@@ eller aims to preserve urban linguistic diversity
stor@@ y@@ telling , by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ User Daniele Rossi , using the CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 license .
can there be a possibility to contact someone here and now despite a language barrier ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) initiative , the number of stories in their original language is a possible answer to it .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the insur@@ moun@@ table blog .
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written word but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language diversity of large cities .
in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has held events since 2015 , the risk that small and not very small languages are not passed on to the children born there .
the following applies to the cre@@ ators of the project :
the mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities that embrace diversity - safe spaces where people don &apos;t have to forget who they are to belong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening to it is often associated to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these events instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening to appreciate , to feel , to soci@@ alize &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format stor@@ yt@@ ellers discuss their story first in their own language and translate or interpret them in English .
even if the participants are not a professional story t@@ eller , their devotion and representation lead to the fact that the audience list@@ ens to it .
they evoke laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows , for example , a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller , Ras@@ si@@ dat@@ ou , takes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative art for her country .
in another event , John Ny@@ ug@@ ara tells the f@@ able of the bun@@ ny and the Bab@@ oon in Sh@@ ona &apos;s language from Zimbabwe :
after explaining the meaning of his parable , John Ny@@ ug@@ ara is asked : &quot; how to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a wide gr@@ in he shares his sense of inclu@@ si@@ veness :
you have listened to it !
they were attentive ...
they were totally with me !
up to now , the events of Treas@@ ure Language stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and the organizers hope to extend this . anyone who is inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS to organize their own story scre@@ enings .
Puerto Rico asks the US to re@@ establish public debt
with the aim of re@@ viewing the public debts of Puerto Rico , which amounted to 72 million US dollars , several religious and civil organisations participated in a mass demonstration last April 3 , 2017 ; the March started at the gan@@ gr@@ an Cap@@ it@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and proc@@ eeded to the Plaza de Col@@ Ã³n in the old town of San Ju@@ ani .
it was proclaimed by the group &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ ud@@ ad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ Ã­a de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( Ci@@ vic Front for the No@@ tification of Deb@@ t ) and the ec@@ umen@@ ical Church Assembly of Puerto Rico .
the advoc@@ ates of the res@@ ett@@ lement of debt also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their requirement :
the people of Puerto Rico ask that politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies responsible for the debts are held ac@@ coun@@ table for their corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for a financial audit and a Ste@@ ering Committee without personal interests in public debt , with a fixed , working conditions related to the economy acting in favor of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are black@@ ma@@ iled and oppressed .
the people of Puerto Rico refuse to pay a debt that is not thei@@ rs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not be reconc@@ iled with declining pension payments .
we demand immediate action .
the island - not the sovereign territory of the United States - suffers from a severe financial crisis .
therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Zentrum fÃ¼r Neue Wirtschaft , &quot; a non @-@ profit non @-@ profit organisation without party affili@@ ation , proposes a law on state responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state supervisory authority .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Rico requires a wide restructuring of state infrastructure .
measures imposed from outside will be at risk without the participation and convic@@ tions of citizens to be rejected by the people .
the demonstration was named &quot; night watch for light and truth . &quot;
here are some impressions :

the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web developer Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and members continued the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he made for an open network .
this year &apos;s re : Public@@ a , the annual conference on digital culture hosted in Berlin , was dedicated to the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign .
MÃ©@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of the London @-@ based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ Ã¼h@@ ling , managing director of book spr@@ ints , produced books within three to five days , read excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Coll@@ ective Inqu@@ iry ( The Cost of Freedom : a Coll@@ ective Future Research ) .
the book , which was published last year and is freely available here , contains a series of articles dealing with the free culture in the face of oppression .
it is a homage to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it says :
this book wants to discuss how to build movements for free knowledge and what are the real costs associated with it .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movement for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news@@ feeds and to make some sense out of our various experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15 , 2012 .
his name was taken from the directory of the A@@ dra prison in which he sat on 3 October 2015 .
since then , we have no information about its current state or where@@ ab@@ outs .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book entitled Coll@@ ective Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce gives his friends and family a voice that will push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom , instantly .
seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture has many of us start thinking about their own dest@@ ini@@ es , actions and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what did we choose ?
what have we given up in this process from times of extreme convic@@ tions ?
the web developer for open source and digital assets has been in the custody of Syrian government authorities since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred to an unknown location from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution .
his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; military police bas@@ el had taken part as a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military tri@@ bunal in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by people on November 12 , 2015 who presented themselves as the insi@@ ders of the Assad administration and informed them of an alleged death sentence against their husband .
but his where@@ ab@@ outs and conditions remain unknown .
a pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the general public in Syria .
Bar@@ ry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and currently the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Bas@@ le &apos;s cultural prototypes was fores@@ ighted than the work he began with a group of arch@@ e@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important arch@@ eological sites in the world , was the cross@@ roads of many civili@@ zations and here Greek @-@ Roman architecture styles merge with local traditions and Persian influences .
at that time , Bass@@ el was not able to know that ten years after he began working with this work , the IS would do everything to em@@ body this architecture , which em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Syria but of the world .
this journey into digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be inv@@ alu@@ able for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
obviously , Bass@@ el hasn &apos;t been able to finish this project yet .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I spent my whole life dream of freedom and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el taught me English even when he was already in jail .
I learned to read , write and speak English well .
he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked . he taught other prisoners to read , write and speak English .
Bass@@ el opened the door to technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
he also taught other prisoners how to use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without actually holding one in their hands .
G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of waiting ( waiting ) , a commission which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 her husband when he was in custody .
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together on the book for a year .
she smu@@ g@@ gled the lyrics to him when he visited him and he translated them from Arabic into English .
the book is freely available .
book cover by Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; here is an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It happens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
it happens at every visit ,
that I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes ,
that I lose the mind at the moment in which we embrace ,
that every danger doesn &apos;t matter to me ,
each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and watch@@ men
I forget the prison &apos;s thr@@ ong
and I enter every detail of your voice and words
that I wear with passion
when your eyes say good@@ bye
and I let another piece of my soul be with you ...
I return quickly to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to bring back all the moments ,
and about your absence to cry and smile .
I convince myself that I will return soon ...
on the first anniversary of the imprisonment of Bass@@ el G@@ haz@@ i wrote :
one year goes by , my soul
during the course of time
I am in your cage ,
and you are still in the cage of monsters
Bas@@ sels History is not unique in Syria .
since the protests in 2011 against the Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) .
those who were arrested or disappeared under the regime of force were tor@@ tured or even executed .
by 2016 , according to the International Human Rights Organisation , Am@@ nesty International died at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians in detention .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
we repeat our call today in the hope that we have to do this for the last time .
Mozambique : vice @-@ president of corruption sentenced to previous post
Mozambique re@@ acted with anger to a corruption incident in which a government member returned after half of his sentence to the workplace in the state apparatus where corruption was committed .
it is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and , together with four other defend@@ ants , was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment for an off@@ setting of 54 million Me@@ tik@@ al ( about 800 000 Euros ) .
the money came from public funds from the airport of Mozambique , whose advice was Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 for good guidance and immediately demanded his re @-@ adjustment to the company , which happened on April 19 .
in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , which rejected the request , there would be no obstacle for Cam@@ ba@@ za to return to his old posts since the company did not perform disciplinary proceedings after his detention .
however , many people do not like the action well .
in an interview with Deutsche Welle , the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Int@@ egri@@ da de P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lica , C@@ IP ) condemned the decision of the company to re @-@ establish the director in an interview with Deutsche Welle :
is a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and highlights the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards to the efforts of our legal system , such as C@@ IP .
what we take note of is that the company should have initiated a disciplinary approach against the off@@ ence .
however , the company apparently kept silent and did not take appropriate legal steps to apply the appropriate functions .
Eg@@ Ã­@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Moz@@ am@@ bic@@ an social media , also re@@ jects this behaviour and considers the case as &quot; contradic@@ tory . &quot;
if Cam@@ ba@@ za was a competent type , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to prison and half of whom had eaten half .
he could give paid lectures and motiv@@ ational speeches , he could advise and polish his image .
but since he is in@@ competent , he agreed to be integrated into the company , which he helped to harm .
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za is fond of being paid for his silence .
contradic@@ tory !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says the director does not possess any mor@@ als :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za is rewarded by the state because he insul@@ ted him , I can &apos;t believe that you are rewarded by someone who has already insul@@ ted the state so mas@@ sively . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cam@@ ba@@ za lacks the mor@@ ale to return and serve the state , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead he only served himself in the state .
Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself has become tired of this man who was accused and eventually sentenced to a long prison sentence .
hon@@ estly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewar@@ ding .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ Ãº@@ te pre@@ fers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , to remember that a th@@ ief belongs to prison :
thi@@ eves belong to the prison Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el will not only remain in memory for the Mozambique cans but also as the first independent president , but also as a sharp , single @-@ ed@@ ged and - by the way - proph@@ etic speakers .
one of his most famous oral representations , when he for@@ c@@ efully acknowledged that &quot; an ambitious man is capable of all , even the fa@@ ther@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest , to sell . &quot;
Sam@@ or@@ ah also said : &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious person changes , my experience shows that it is not like that . he changes the tactics but he doesn &apos;t turn away from his ambi@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious human being is at the same time criminal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were also negative :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison , spending 10 years and free .

Facebook blocks the &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; rac@@ ist word in Myanmar and does not cens@@ or many users
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as or spl@@ inters . &quot; &quot; &quot;

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took up their posts from the net , because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although the origin of the word is still being discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of eastern origin or generally used as adj@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot;
as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma , the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; or the &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; is part of an initiative .
in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely depreci@@ ating conn@@ ot@@ ation .
in particular , it is a word used mostly by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims , representing a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in the effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &apos; may normally be associated with racism , but the word itself does not automatically call forth hate speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that even posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubts for their use .
in addition , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with basic mean@@ ings that have the same character sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , it is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; containing the same letters as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( Spi@@ der b@@ se ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ kn@@ u@@ ck@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post from one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends in a wit@@ ty way whether they knew how to ease his back pain by making a p@@ un .
the sentence ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resembles the rac@@ ist phrase , but the context is completely different .
there were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
Z@@ in Win H@@ tet is convinced that she will reduce hate speech by radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytical before del@@ eting all posts that are suspected of spreading racism .
Facebook does not delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it filters the word automatically .
automati@@ sm will not understand what you are writing at Fac@@ e@@ ook .
what it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and control it by checking the words next to it .
for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( spl@@ inters ) .
the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists who spread hate speech receive a fairly good lesson .
now it is time to pr@@ une their nation@@ alism .
while the action may send a strong signal to all who hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long .
the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proved that the cens@@ orship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game , whereby users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or alternative notation of the cens@@ ored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook started to delete his posts when he wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was ban@@ ished from the social network :
... when I became aware of this new directive from Facebook , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and I was banned from posting , posting and sharing content for 24 hours , because the post &quot; Facebook community standards did not correspond . &quot;
Facebook has removed many posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed , which has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
in the post , the author has given his opinion why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism are bad in the country .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet Community to ask for advice :
Facebook likes to have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intent to l@@ essen racism in Burma through its platform , but it does not work .
cens@@ oring such words will bring more hatred within the various communities .
in addition , it seems that they have started this without a local context or technical support and have banned words such as &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; pe@@ a curr@@ y . &quot;
even when they found out they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the fake posts .
if they had little more respect for the 15 million benefits that gave them a big turnover , that would be great .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automated cens@@ orship has caused a lot of mo@@ ck@@ ery among users . &quot; &quot; &quot;
instead of taking it seriously , users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the net .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts , which did not contain hate speech , but were still removed :
used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat a pe@@ a curr@@ y and watch an Indian film . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; just to try out if Facebook removes the mail containing the word Kal@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the post says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , do you then heal people ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
over the past five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists who have used social networks to expand their voices and influence have increased .
among other things , hate speech in social networks is said to inc@@ ite violence in Myanmar &apos;s communities , especially in the Rak@@ h@@ ine region , where confron@@ tations between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised for its failure to control susp@@ elling hate speech on its Bur@@ m@@ ese pages .
but instead of simply cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better to look at context rather than code @-@ focused initiatives and learned from them .
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is the end of the child marriage
a wedding ring in the sand .
photo by Der@@ ek Gav@@ ey , CC B@@ Y 2.0 .
the child before is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , the parliament of the country unanim@@ ously approved a law to pro@@ hibit this practice , so that the age @-@ capable age is now at 18 .
in May 2016 , Brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ sad Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the various religious groups in the country , said that the state should not interfere unless the age does not have maturity . &quot;
this happened in spite of the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago are a contract partner of the UN Convention on Child Rights , the min@@ ors as &quot; defined &quot; every man under the age of 18 .
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children married to 15 was 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and with 18 , it was 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office confirmed that from 1997 to 2007 , more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1,@@ 300 boys were married under 19 .
online peti@@ tions and social media mo@@ tions , which were anxious to aboli@@ sh laws on child@@ birth , followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly , they helped to bring this result .
nevertheless , everything went smoothly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an Hin@@ du leader , for example , had no qual@@ ms about telling the critics of the kid@@ dies , they should try to take care of their own affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this actually un@@ complicated matter , and at some point doubts came on whether the opposition would agree to the draft law at all .
but at the beginning of 2017 the bill against child marriage was decided - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent who ab@@ stained , so that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him the law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now only the president of the country has to agree and let the law be proclaimed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the sen@@ ators of the country announced on Facebook a status update , which Les@@ lie @-@ An@@ n Bo@@ is@@ elle posted on Inst@@ ag@@ ram again :
Mr. Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against child marriage was voted in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes and no one against it .
having previously decided in the Senate , the draft may now become a law .
the majority of social media users were thrilled , because the laws of child@@ birth had finally changed .
Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who held a minist@@ erial office in the Ministry of Education , said :
it took too much time and unnecessary talk , which disgu@@ ised the core of the matter , but do you know what ? the child before is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that is worth almost any price .
while Abel Jackson was of the opinion , it was definitely long enough to aboli@@ sh the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ ir@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day had come :
public status update on Facebook von L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ al - Thomas , which states : News , Excell@@ ent news !
the Act has been approved .
minimum age - 18 , Vo@@ ices - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
torture Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group , who spoke quite openly about how important the adoption of the law was , noted :
the marriage @-@ capable age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of the religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
the draft for the amend@@ ment of the Act was adopted today on 9 June 2017 .
there were 41 de@@ pu@@ ties in the House of Represent@@ atives and 35 were present at the vote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all MEPs who were present have voted for the law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the child@@ birth is not permitted by law in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long struggle ( ... ) .
many thanks to all the activists who fought him .
congratulations .
a thank you to our de@@ pu@@ ties .
however , a possible clas@@ h comes in the form of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the secretary general of San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hin@@ du organization of the country .
months ago , Mahar@@ aj announced his intention to take legal action , the law should be passed , and he seems to fulfil his promise .
while the At@@ tor@@ ney General Paris Al ra@@ wi , an advoc@@ ate of the law , said it was quite legitimate if Mahar@@ aj wanted to act against the law , most social media users wanted to approach the debate on the subject differently .
Patricia Wor@@ rel@@ l suggested :
instead of talking about the problem , instead of talking about the problem , instead of talking about the problem that the state , our daughters protect them from being ab@@ used against them , &quot; would you then be willing to continue the discussion ?
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
but whether it comes to a judicial action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where the child &apos;s marriage in different gra@@ dations is legal or continues to be the norm although there are laws which they fail .

by mirr@@ oring web pages , Turkish users can view Wikipedia content again
the English @-@ language Wikipedia page was presented on January 18 , 2012 contrary to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright legislation in the USA , internationally dark@@ ened .
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
for over a month now Turkey has been blocking the popular and crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based on en@@ cyclo@@ pedia Wikipedia .
day after day , it becomes clear how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful and reliable information .
both students as well as re@@ porters and fans of TV series fight against blocking .
although many tech @-@ sav@@ vy Internet users are used to use circum@@ ference tools for blocked websites ( an up @-@ to @-@ date article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN pre@@ valence in the world ) , most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been blocking articles from Wikipedia , as described recently in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular blocking of the Internet has been held since 2007 , after the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted .
according to China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship from Wikipedia .
while the platform continues to be blocked , multiple mirrors ( pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and are frequently updated ) are di@@ pped .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform laid down all the Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centralized pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network , which does not support the system of domain names and thus makes a complete cens@@ orship difficult .
however , the content is available in spite of legal pro@@ hibit@@ ors .
in a blog post , IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
after we have heard the news ( about the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we put everything in place to screen sn@@ apshots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , the possibility of reading the contents on a de@@ centralized and distributed way is possible .
this can help users to at least view all Wikipedia content , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org themselves .
IP@@ FS also indicated that this step was carried out independently of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is only about screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock .
Cris@@ tian Con@@ son@@ ni of Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Italy has produced both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ .org , a M@@ irr@@ or@@ seite of Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that anyone can use to host similar M@@ irr@@ ors pages when locked in the relevant country Wikipedia .
Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices Member and employees of Mozilla at the Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; Pod@@ cast :
it is not a complete copy of a proxy address , a mirror .
you access another URL that is not the original . that which you can see is from Wikipedia .
essentially , the server transfers the request to the correct Wikipedia page , so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia , even if they are locked in Turkey .
this is done by a server not in Turkey .
a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for nature conservation
a succ@@ eeding N@@ ash@@ orn , Ch@@ it@@ wan .
photo by Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
used with permission .
Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him . they were blur@@ red with badly positioned motifs and washed colours .
this motivated him to carry a camera and try to stra@@ igh@@ ten the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar tries to bring Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife to the international stage .
and his hom@@ etown , next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to take photographs that draw attention to N@@ ept@@ une &apos;s wildlife .
he described on Facebook how this prime location helps him in his work :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! !
I was at home just when Navar@@ aj ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Castle ) suddenly called me . he had received a call from my father that a le@@ op@@ ard would be on the banks of the Rap@@ ti River .
the Kur@@ fÃ¼r@@ sten@@ damm is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father had watched him and showed me the place on the other river side , where the le@@ op@@ ard was located and I immediately began to kne@@ el pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar seeks cooperation with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition of Nepal &apos;s nature and wants to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as sc@@ ary as they look .
and he ought to know , for he stood Tig@@ ers face to face ,
a tiger cannot be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep during sleeping ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .

to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; I click for conservation . &quot;
however , his passion for promoting Nep@@ al@@ ese nature and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days , and usually lived in a tent to take photographs of Ot@@ ters at Bar@@ dia National Park . until 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodations .

this post was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published by Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international collaborative media organization from India .
a revised version was once again published as part of a content sharing agreement .
in many parts of India , women are avoiding women with the greatest care to pron@@ ounce the names of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
instead they use a pron@@ ou@@ n or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h , women admit that due to their social pressure they should respect the husband , and fear of the consequences should dis@@ regard the norm to keep this practice alive .
last year Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was tried by the Indian State of O@@ dish@@ a by a pseu@@ do @-@ court and rejected by her family and the community of the village after she had addressed a married relatives with her name .
the tradition of nam@@ ing their wives by name is also common among men . however , they have far less fear to fear , if any , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health personnel and house@@ wives , joined a unique club and became the main theme of the city .
it is a place only for them , in which they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the patri@@ archy .
as one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states , he is part of the # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al campaign , operated by the video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers community and campaig@@ ning for the disman@@ tling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ z has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera to cover practices such as children &apos;s marriage and ban@@ ishment of HIV and AIDS infected , and manages this club .
she reports how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time have made them ambass@@ adors of change .
the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in their discussion rounds dealt with women who do not call their hus@@ bands by name .
she chose this topic because she wanted to open the conversation about the patri@@ archy with a problem with which the women can easily identify .
it is a custom that they all maintain and never questioned the name of their hus@@ bands .
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not consider this is considered a dec@@ eit@@ ful woman , as a woman without morality .
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this until this round of discussions .
at the beginning Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband by name , wanted to try out at home , as it runs .
she showed the video of the panel discussion with her husband and mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells us :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video was over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said that I should call him from now on by his name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this confidence in the luggage , Roh@@ ini began their first discussion club .
many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; before . some believed it was a good thing because it meant that younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , the women tried to get the discussion going .
Roh@@ ini asked each participant to say her husband &apos;s name with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then she asked all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us how they want , does that mean they don &apos;t respect us ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; should it not be equivalent ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they gave their hus@@ bands on their lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was of the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra about breaking a centuries @-@ old tradition in which married women never allowed to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands .
Roh@@ ini tells us :
a woman was so shy that during the whole exercise she only gi@@ g@@ gled in front of herself ; another decided to let out the whole stuff@@ ed fru@@ stration with him and his family by cur@@ sing him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
still in adren@@ aline rush about having broken with an ancient custom , the women decided that at home they would actually try to name their hus@@ bands by their name .
and they kept their word .
in the next few days , Roh@@ ini received a lot of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put the women in her head : his wife could not stop saying his name .
another club member decided to do it during dinner before the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her , she was frigh@@ tened and said that it was a mistake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation was in force .
Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices such as wearing the zin@@ ox @-@ red dot on the forehead , indicating the Eh@@ vest@@ atus :
why do women only have to show that they are married ?
I said to my husband that I would wear the zin@@ ox @-@ red dot , if he did it too .
he laugh@@ ed only and I stopped wearing it .
the other women have not stopped completely , but think they are now in a better position to choose themselves to not wear it on some days .
for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip with every discussion club . &quot; &quot; &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry about who could hear something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last months they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes for the first time in their lives ; they d@@ anced and sang and talked about things they had never thought about before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so hon@@ estly about certain things , for example , how our identi@@ ties have attached to our hus@@ bands .
it feels great to be able to say things lou@@ dly , no matter how small they happen to be .
in a discussion round , we talked about the concept of honor and how it is related to clothes .
some women in the group have only carried sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most things this is okay , but some wanted to wear a Sal@@ em @-@ Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a pants , they did not dare .
after a lot of dispute and discussion about the advantages of their own choice of clothes , the moral of the sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini smu@@ g@@ gled their own couple of Kur@@ tas ( upper shirts ) into a discussion round so that women could wear them .
next , they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will do it .
on the question of whether something has changed in the five months since its first discussion club , Roh@@ ini confirms that things slowly come into play :
we have only done small steps so far .
some women tried it for a few times , but then stopped telling her husband &apos;s name .
some , including me , are still doing it , but only when they are alone and no other family members are there .
only one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women are wearing Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ rot on their foreh@@ e@@ ads at any time .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the hag@@ gling for more freedom of movement or the choice of clothes - lie at the end of a difficult to navigate flow .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how to explain Roh@@ ini :
each one of us is a victim of the patri@@ archy .
I am also .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people what we are talking about and what we are doing .
we all sit in the same boat .

the first Japan visit of the popular band The Beat@@ les is celebrated with a commem@@ oration day
the Beat@@ les at their landing in Japan .
screen@@ shot of the official YouTube channel of the Beat@@ les .
on June 29th of this year , the h@@ ash@@ tag was to be seen in the Japanese Twitter trend where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les .
the visit of the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is regarded as a turning point in the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war period .
the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ i@@ ko , who exclusively inter@@ viewed the Beat@@ les in London in 1964 , marked the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit :
for just under five days the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese go through .
the people here have quickly become clear that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many known Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith , when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language as English , &quot; Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , president of the retail giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review .
good morning ! . today is the Beat@@ les memorial day in Japan . at least 51 years ago they were here in Tokyo .
also today songs from the Beat@@ les are sung in Japanese kar@@ aoke bars and in English classes at Japanese central schools .
the Kit@@ sch of the Beat@@ les survi@@ ves everything .
today is Beat@@ les memorial day .
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
I don &apos;t know if this &quot; W@@ inn@@ ie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; doll should be John L@@ enn@@ on or not .
and as it is for fans , Japanese , of course , also make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the well @-@ known places associated with the band .
if you love the Beat@@ les , that &apos;s your 5 places that you absolutely have to visit .
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Math@@ ew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fiel@@ ds ( memorial in New York )
4 ) P@@ enny Lane
5 ) ( V@@ om Link ) The Beat@@ les Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool
pilgri@@ ma@@ ges may sometimes not be bizarre enough :
good morning together .
today is Beat@@ les memorial day .
right now in 1966 the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time .
the characters from the film K @-@ On ! went on a pilgrimage to London and ran across Abbey Road .
we did the same last year as well .
and of course some companies also use the fan community in the market , such as this R@@ amen @-@ Shop ( r@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo .
good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen ! . today is Beat@@ les memorial day .
and what could this be for a day ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; today I will listen to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ ester@@ day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and eat R@@ amen no@@ od@@ les at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

long @-@ headed men are ab@@ duc@@ ted and killed in Mozambique
the police of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia warned the population that bald men could be a target of attacks in Mozambique .

a new system of kidn@@ apping of bald people for organ traffi@@ cking , probably for non @-@ religious purposes , is worried by the police of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government has now called for a number of operations to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ k , a few kilometers from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims was de@@ capit@@ ated and part of the organs had been taken .
two men were arrested and subsequently they conf@@ essed that the bodies of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi are used .
there is the local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a bald man could reveal gold or bring wealth , the police spokes@@ man of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia of the BBC .
it is the first time that successive attacks on long @-@ headed men were registered in Mozambique .
another group , the goal of kill@@ ings for obsc@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the UN 2016 in the South African country to carry out a mission to investigate this practice .
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in the neighbouring country of Tanzania , where the government has developed campaigns to combat these super@@ sti@@ tions and prejudi@@ ces .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in Map@@ u@@ to city .
he warned those who plan to travel to the country :
respect for bald men who travel to Mozambique for long @-@ headed men in Mozambique are the target of ritu@@ alistic attacks , the Moz@@ am@@ bic@@ an police warned of the latest kill@@ ings of three bald men due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ k , where the kill@@ ings took place .
hus@@ hed Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and inhabit@@ ant of the city of In@@ ham@@ ban@@ e in the south of Mozambique , said that the local police have already followed the case :
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the bald men .
the persecution and murder of single @-@ headed individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ ru@@ mb@@ ala , province of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia , for prob@@ able rituals , has cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans ( PR@@ M ) , which also indicates that a faith exists , according to which the victims in the head might have power generating riches .
in recent days , three men have been killed with hair loss problems in this part of the country .
on Facebook Angela Fer@@ rei@@ ra Sam@@ an@@ tha shared the chron@@ icle of the blo@@ gger poor Sn@@ ai@@ ppa explaining that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Mozambique :
I M@@ Ã@@ CH@@ TE like to be ashamed of a country in which people would have shame to demand sex against good marks , and even take their lives to earn their bread , a land where people would not hurt or even take their lives to earn their bread , a land in which neither the Al@@ bin@@ os nor k@@ ah@@ le or bald @-@ headed for super@@ sti@@ tious purposes or &quot; black magic &quot; are hun@@ ted to achieve sexual richness .
despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some of the opportunities for mac@@ ab@@ re hum@@ our could not be missed .
Zen@@ aida &apos;s Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Mozambique and enthusiastic Twitter user , twe@@ et@@ ete that both the head of the district Mor@@ ru@@ mb@@ ala , Pedro S@@ app@@ enheim , and the police spokes@@ man Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zi@@ as , In@@ Ã¡@@ cio D@@ ina , are both open @-@ minded :

a pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria , active in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il ( also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi ) has played a key role in expanding public access to the Internet and Open Knowledge .
he was a close friend of many from the Global Vo@@ ices community and took part in the 2009 Arab B@@ logger .
in November 2015 , Bas@@ sels wife N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by persons who themselves spend themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad administration .
they reported that their husband had been sentenced to death , but no further information was given .
Bas@@ le &apos;s stay and constitution were unknown until today ( 01 August 2017 ) when N@@ our@@ a of Syrian officials learned that he was executed in 2015 .
today and in the future , we pay tribute to Bass@@ el &apos;s oeu@@ vre as a pioneer of the open web movement .
and we appreciate the efforts of all those individuals and organisations who have been campaig@@ ning for his release over the last five years .
since 2011 and the start of the protests against the regime of Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared , such as the Syrian Network for Human Rights organisation .
countless of those arrested or disappeared by the regime are subjected to torture and even exec@@ utions .
between 2011 and 2016 , no less than 17,@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians have died in custody , such as the international human rights organization Am@@ nesty International .

a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , which was probably made recently .
this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 in Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the imprisoned Chinese dis@@ sident , Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he was hospit@@ alized for liver cancer in the final stage .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to 11 years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state endanger@@ ment ) after he participated in the draft Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o calling for democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Li@@ us case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an internal affair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and told a spokesperson , he considered it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yet China continues to receive calls from the international community , the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , to allow him to be treated abroad .
while some countries have critici@@ zed the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are completely wi@@ ped out .
Hong Kong Free Press has summari@@ zed some reactions from abroad .
United Nations and the United Nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment on whether the United Nations should ex@@ ert pressure to allow Li@@ u to be treated abroad .
Norway - Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ Ã¸r@@ ge Br@@ ende refused to answer questions about Li@@ u &apos;s release .
the relationship between China and Norway was st@@ alled after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u in 2010 , although the Norwegian government announced that this ultimately had nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations continued only in December last year , and only in June Norway was signed an agreement to resume the salmon trip to China , since the exports since 2010 were largely blocked .
after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo .
due to his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his price .
during the ceremony , Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
the European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to immediately release Li@@ u and his wife from house arrest and allow him to seek medical assistance wherever he wants .
the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called on China to release Li@@ u , as stated in a statement on 30 June :
at the same time , we expect that China lifts all restrictions of Mr. Li@@ us &apos;s wife and family members .
they are to meet and receive all visits they desire and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
United States of America
&quot; &quot; &quot; U.S. Ambassador , Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad , stated that Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; want him to have the possibility of treatment abroad , in so far as it assists him in his recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of the U.S. Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency AF@@ P on 27 June that the message ur@@ ges Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u , but also to release his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from house arrest .
the call of the U.S. embassy drew a fur@@ ious response from China , with the utter@@ ance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that &quot; no country has the right to intervene and make ir@@ responsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley said that China should offer the couple the following :
protection and freedom , such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of its choice , to which they claim according to the Constitution and the legal system as well as international obligations .
the U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz have also adopted a resolution in the Congress to push the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally .

&quot; &quot; &quot; German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin hoping that Li@@ u &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gets all the medical support he needs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping appeared on July 7 and 8 at the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg .
previously reported diplomatic sources in Beijing at the news agency Reu@@ ters reported that China had big concerns about whether the vor@@ tex could over@@ shadow Li@@ u &apos;s visit to Hamburg .
Canada and the USA
on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um called on China to provide appropriate medical care to Li@@ u and give him the opportunity to take care of his family .
Li@@ u lawyer talked to AF@@ P beforehand that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always watched the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to speak with someone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact .
Mc@@ Call@@ um continues to say :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Canada is calling on China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , and acqu@@ it those rights for the exercise of these rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
France and the United Kingdom
France &apos;s Foreign Ministry requested China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons in an explanation on 29 June :
all the necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all the treatments he needs , regardless of where . furthermore , his wife and his family should have contact with him .
although the news channel France Info has already reported that Li@@ u &apos;s French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the State Department announced that there will be no further information whether France will ultimately accept it .
Taiwan Shop in Taiwan
the Council of mainland jobs in Taiwan called on China on 27 June to release Li@@ u and show a greater tolerance towards those who advoc@@ ate peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development .
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legislature Yu M@@ ei @-@ nu from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also called on China to permit the sick intellectual Li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama from the Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , was very concerned about Li@@ u in an explanation on June 28 , and admitted that many asked him to pray for Li@@ u &apos;s well @-@ being .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he was severely punished would have led to a more harmonious , more stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world .
I personally felt very moved and encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , signed the Charter 08 that stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore . the City of Singapore .

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognised as an independent state at an international level .
but according to K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am Justice Minister , Singapore should be considered a city .
this remark has spark@@ ed a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
during the meeting at the meeting of the international branch of the Bar Association of New York , the Minister re@@ marked that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they were compared to Singapore with other countries .
he supported that Singapore should be considered a city .
... no one questioned whether New York was a democracy ...
this is what most people make a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
the Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o blog acc@@ uses the Minister of Justice to &quot; twist the logic &quot; to defend the existing authorit@@ arian exercise of power in Singapore .
and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this valuable land , we hear that ultimately we are not a country .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of fle@@ eing the responsibilities , a breach of duty .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose land is it then ?
the reasons cited by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am were not very no@@ bel : he defended an idea according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &quot; normal countries &quot; in the face of this , he was in@@ vari@@ ably un@@ democratic .
on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities like Chicago , San Francisco or New York , likewise cities that are permanently led by a party .
these cities are democratic .
once you reach the core of the subject , the good old ly@@ re appears again from the authorit@@ arian rulers who pret@@ end to be democr@@ ats , leaving the twi@@ sted logic , since it fits better to their power .
during the final week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am , the answers given to his American guests regarding our press , our judi@@ ci@@ ary , our political system were really non @-@ rep@@ lies .
he disgu@@ ised the corresponding questions with non @-@ answers of rational nature .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am to clarify his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion .
I personally think it is a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
when Singapore is not a country but a city , so to what country belongs to our city ...
in short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very grateful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am would take the trouble to clear this point as long as it was paid up to be part of the government of Singapore .
by publishing his comment on the blog , An@@ on points out to the critics that one should start reading the entire tran@@ script of the conference to better understand the context of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am &apos;s statements , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country .
read the tran@@ script .
when he said that Singapore was rather a &quot; city &quot; than a country , &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore are so un@@ equal , even if we enjoy free and fair elections .
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was not a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he obviously did not mean it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am , who as leader of an adol@@ escent generation , makes such a pol@@ em@@ ic statement .
I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said .
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard , what I expected - whether I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am , member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes that , properly associates and is aware of what he def@@ ends .
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review dis@@ covers the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am &apos;s arguments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; did Mr Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am have committed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good beli@@ ever &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian speaker ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Singapore is not a country , we are only considered an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , what country will the sovereign rights of Singapore return to ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally land and city .
since he plays an important role within the cabinet cabinet , Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am &apos;s statements are of serious importance .
why do the people of Singapore do their military service , but do they defend their city only ?
who does our prime minister need to pay back ?
what is the value of our pink employee ID ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade ten@@ ses to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore and was always a city :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I did not say what I said ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this set seems to have anno@@ yed many people of Singapore ...
no one ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; defending the country above all &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; etc . , but that is not quite correct . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather speak of defending the city .
the myth of the &quot; nice Canadian &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices asked his editors recently : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home or homeland ?
their answers are published here as part of a continuing series , revealing rum@@ ors about certain parts of the world and showing another fac@@ et .
the latest part of this series is from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
the question I most asked in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I reply . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 1994 I have been living there and again in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on what situation the conversation takes place , it is considered pol@@ ite to show interest in his inter@@ loc@@ utor by asking personal questions .
my clari@@ fication often follows the standard answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; many Can@@ adi@@ ans maybe cook in front of anger when they are kept for Americans , but that doesn &apos;t bo@@ ther me .
for someone who doesn &apos;t know , there is little that Can@@ adi@@ ans distinguish us from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans bring a Canadian flag visi@@ bly to their back@@ pack when they are leaving .
all the love Can@@ adi@@ ans .
Americans , on the other hand ... .
so it was already when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tru@@ mp , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 .
Can@@ adi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le leaves on their bags to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors .
we have a free healthcare system !
there are no weapons at all !
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
all seem to think Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
we evi@@ dently say &quot; ap@@ ologies . &quot;
Canada is said to be the most toler@@ ant country over ethnic groups .
we are not as these types south of the border .
we Can@@ adi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
first , I have many American friends , whom I admire very much .
I wouldn &apos;t mind if you were confused with Johnny from Dallas for example .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
first , being referred to as &quot; nice , &quot; means to be generous - like the ben@@ ign , gentle , but tra@@ gically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; Die Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has its own Canadian double @-@ go@@ ers ) .
if Canada is really a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , that would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing you can encounter .
to be harmless is to be in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and not to deserve any attention .
this can be a good thing if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , far away from things that happen around you .
I would even go as far as saying that the desire to be free and alone is a major part of Can@@ adi@@ ans .
we tend to take care of our own affairs only .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what out@@ si@@ ders describe as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk about the fence with their neighbors .
we lack the warm , open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends .
thank@@ fully for us ( and for the rest of the world ) Jus@@ tin Tru@@ deau em@@ beds the stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our Prime Minister made Canada sexy .
music video of a pop band par@@ ody Thailand &apos;s j@@ un@@ ta
a pop band famous in Thailand has published a music video that the j@@ un@@ ta par@@ o@@ ols , which in 2014 seized power and , despite their promise , re @-@ establish the civilian government , continues to rule the country .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tat@@ too Colour describes a young man telling what rules his girlfriend makes .
although not explicitly political , the music video refers indirectly to the continued military rule of the j@@ un@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country &apos;s situation .
the video to the song was a huge success .
within the first three days , the video uploaded to Facebook was 1.@@ 25@@ 4 times shared and received 8,@@ 800 Li@@ kes .
last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists told the public to watch this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , in particular about the situation of the country under the j@@ un@@ ta rule .
take a look at these recordings of the video , which relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has persist@@ ently pursued over the past three years .
the &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; may refer to dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the provisional constitution , which gives absolute power to the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army on important national issues .
the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program for the &quot; change of setting &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people considered by the Jun@@ ta as a critic .
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and unclear rules are often exploited by the authorities to arrest activists and other revi@@ e@@ wers of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit was established in the army , which monitors online content and accused persons accused of having rejected the monarchy , prosec@@ uted .
Thailand establishes a strict end against &quot; The Most Maj@@ esty . &quot;
martial law was proclaimed in Thailand on 20 May 2014 .
two days later it came to a put@@ sch of the army .
one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to pursue is their decision to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warned them that the purchase was unnecessary and a waste of tax money .
the video shows how people are thrown into a black van before placing them in an intern@@ ment camp , another problem .
some journalists are in prison , because they allegedly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened for long imprisonment , they should ins@@ ult the monarchy .
meanwhile the band &apos;s te@@ aser showed members of the band , which im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The Hunger Games , &quot; which was already used by coup opponents during the protests in 2014 .
life continues in the ruins of gh@@ ost towns in eastern Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia

the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with kind permission .
the post @-@ war society slowly reco@@ vers in East @-@ Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ rel@@ al .
now more than 20 years have passed since the Geor@@ gian @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ as@@ hic war officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still very visible in this part of the Republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking pictures .
villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ kh@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ ch@@ ava are located in the basin of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , Sw@@ ans , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked on Soviet sites in the area .
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today , most of the Russians and ch@@ ases are living in the area .
such settlements are also called gh@@ ost cities in Ab@@ k@@ asia .
in the pre @-@ war period there were still more than 10,000 people , today there are only a few hundred people in these gh@@ ost@@ s .
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ ik@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the district has amounted to 16@@ ,000 people , having barely risen over a decade .
in 1989 about 4@@ 3.000 people lived in this district .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the empty five @-@ storey blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s which are called Chr@@ u@@ ch@@ uk@@ ow@@ kas are symbolic of the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are dec@@ ayed and very rare they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native elderly man .
he starts a conversation and it is difficult for him to end this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is nevertheless unique . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the war , the village was full of life .
there were community centers , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens , all of which served as a community .
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded splend@@ or buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union have now left the district .
in the gh@@ ost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha about fifty inhabitants live .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages , it looks similar .
the K@@ hr@@ us@@ h@@ che@@ ek@@ kas , which can accommodate one or two families , can be seen at the balconies , where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover me in the hand with the camera , they immediately withdraw .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our mother has forbidden us to photograph us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she simply for@@ ba@@ de us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her friend and suddenly she leaves the destroyed house and disappears .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ ab@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for their own needs ) , such as cattle breeding , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable cultivation .
it is difficult to get over the rounds .
in winter the district administration provides free candles and bread on the villages for free .

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will grow zu@@ c@@ ch@@ ini &quot;
about ten years ago an older woman called Gal@@ ina ( or T@@ ante G@@ aly@@ a , as it is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to D@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite her oldest daughter living in France , Gal@@ ina never left Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia to live with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my heart will stay in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia for ever , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gal@@ ina doesn &apos;t want to receive any financial help from her daughter and insi@@ sts she supports her younger grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ inas &apos;s monthly pension is just nine dollars .
&quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; she says .
a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a tells her and other vill@@ agers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman and a young family and I live in this building .
when holidays are , we visit us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but we cannot do this all the time - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as she tells her story a younger neighbour appears on the balcony .
&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; calls A@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a to her . &quot; they said we could build zu@@ c@@ ch@@ ini .
I have already prepared the floor .
I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will grow zu@@ c@@ ch@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ a convers@@ ation@@ ist Nat@@ ascha has lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she reminds one of the village life before the war .
despite the relatives who live in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country Ab@@ k@@ asia just collap@@ sed ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave .

&quot; we recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital city of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but it will take a little while , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ ascha gets about $ 9 children &apos;s money for each child .
her husband works in the coal mine .
the young family has its own farm .
near the house , where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten was once , they keep pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chi@@ ckens .
she tells us that at first it was a very frigh@@ tening situation when many people left the village after the war .
but over time it lost its anxiety .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark road or the few people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
but in fact it &apos;s rather something to do with lo@@ ot@@ ings .
after the war there was little work and all lived as they were right .
every day I remember how the city and the war were once . &quot;
when our conversation comes to an end , a little boy runs over to us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hides itself .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ases him afterwards .
he plays with the ball rolling down the hill .
a group of children now tracks the ball rolling .
while they run , some of them throw stones on the damaged buildings .
these ruins are part of their childhood that care for im@@ min@@ de@@ dness in their lives .
they do not know otherwise .

in Mexico , &quot; Mama Africa &quot; houses migrants on their long journey
Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez direc@@ ts a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , Chi@@ ap@@ as State , on the border of Mexico to Guatemala .

this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on April 19 , 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org and appears here with kind permission .
on the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located at the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is led by a 59 @-@ year @-@ old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink spectacle frame and gold colored ear @-@ rings in ted@@ dy bear @-@ form .
she is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . still , they know many under the name Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is due to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
for about 2,@@ 50 dollars a night the guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal .
in the vesti@@ bu@@ le there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign@@ post to the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian immigrants come here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , Mrs Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells us , people are coming to full mini@@ bus and from the upper part of the coast they start calling : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mother Africa ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
where are you Mama Africa ? . &quot;
at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have been sleeping outside on cardboard boxes .
she doesn &apos;t want to reject anyone .
she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are ill , they buy them medicines they cannot pay , they massage them with a bal@@ m of the feet exhausted by the long journey .
Ty@@ ch@@ que Sebas@@ ti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived a short time ago .
I asked him if M@@ um Africa was a reasonable nick@@ name for Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the Sebas@@ ti@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a yo@@ gurt ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel it suits her as African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebas@@ ti@@ ao travels with his sister , who hopes to come to Boston to find her husband and the three children there .
they have lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States to stop taking a first stop in South America and then heading north .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the family had heard of other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he tells that the Hai@@ tians and Afri@@ cans often travel along the route and that Afri@@ cans are already talking about W@@ hat@@ s@@ app by Ms Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
like many of his companions , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil earlier and worked as a construction worker on building sites for the Olympic Games and the World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy became weaker , he began his journey to the United States .
he has been a guest of M@@ om Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I wonder if he will get in contact with Mrs Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez in the future .
&quot; mother Africa is our mother and we never let her go again , &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells her guests often send her text messages when she has gone to greet her or to report her about the course of her journey .
it declares that their Christian faith is the impulse of their work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to cook poultry like in Ghana .
Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the town , a dead end leads to Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have taken migrants in their small house .
he is a polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets to many African migrants are sold too expensive .
he has started to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his home for a dollar the night .
at the moment there are 25 people , mainly Hai@@ tians .
some sleep on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela declares that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people can help and others do not help . that &apos;s why I give them my support . &quot;
after having lived for three years , he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job .
the majority of migrants traveling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula come from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes to them .
JosÃ© Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ Ã©n@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children before people who wanted money to black@@ mail him without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for accommodation and a stranger , a single person , offered him a shelter .
a few months later , the family still lives there and she tries to decide where to go next .
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests .
in the hall@@ ways , travelers will always consult their teleph@@ ones .
a mini@@ bus arrived today and brought 20 new guests , most of them from Somalia .
Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also no@@ stal@@ gic , because of those who have gone .
like a proud grand@@ mother she leaves her album with numerous photos .
there is one of her daughter with African hair fle@@ ece she has made a client , some photos of her grand@@ children and many more , young and old .
she laughs sadly as she briefly introduces it to me .
&quot; Ya sis fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; she repeated every time . &quot; they have already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones .
a Check Point for Personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang by Twitter users .
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minorities region in western China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their phones .
on 10 July , cell phone users in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an Municip@@ ality of Uru@@ m@@ qi received a cell phone notification , in which it instruc@@ ts the district government to install a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; web cleaning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the announcement , it is said that the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevents access to terrorist information &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the authorities must also use the app for more than fighting terrorism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the Autonom@@ ous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ f@@ ecture , because , shortly after they had installed the app , they exchanged messages with a private We@@ Chat group .
the police reported that the app would investigate and prosec@@ ute the sources and distribution channels of terrorists along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ Books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang &apos;s website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om .
the main feature is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic sites , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing sites to alert users how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network .
this app with the min@@ ors is designed to help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; may enable state actors or even h@@ ack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal the home network of a person .
this introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
while reporting on digital cens@@ orship in China is mostly focused on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south , reality is very often glo@@ omy for those living in remote , crowded ethnic minorities such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
in order to limit disturbances and dis@@ content in the conflict regions , the authorities often subordin@@ ate extreme cens@@ ors and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shut@@ downs .
the media outlet &quot; Images from mainland China &quot; ( expressed in Twitter ) , the cens@@ ored news in China , showed photos of a check@@ point where police in@@ discrimin@@ ately checked the inhabitants if they had installed the monitoring app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile alert wanted people to install the app within 10 days .
if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without this software , they may be det@@ ained up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they forced the people to use appliances intended for older people .
this is a form of captivity by the rest @-@ growth technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from mainland China &quot; ( Th@@ ro@@ o@@ wide View@@ ing of the People of Europe ) also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description that results in the software up@@ lifting the key requirement of a Windows operating system , thus obtaining unlimited access to the hard drive of the computer .
after installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang computers and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the provisions in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the directions of the City Council to minim@@ ise the spread of illegal content .
all government branches , authorities and institutions connected to the party , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the instructions of the cy@@ ber security office when they operate their computers and communication devices .
a recent report by Freedom House , an American human rights organization , also mentioned these new surveillance methods :

sleep or death , Part 1 : everything scre@@ ams after death
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .
photo by : Cor@@ rie B@@ ark@@ li@@ more ( CC B@@ Y 2.0 ) .
this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; Sle@@ ep or Death , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison .
far from our blue , virtual world , you look at yourself and realise that you are all alone in a place where everything has gone missing .
everything has gradually van@@ ished and revealed a truth that is clearly recognis@@ able , both inside and outside .
one that gives honour to their name .
one that has fallen into a list of emotions and expressions that do not allow metaph@@ ors .
but when reality takes you back and look behind the scenes - beyond the actor , the beautiful scenes and the performer - the characters transform themselves into beings from flesh and blood , and everything scre@@ ams after death .
all doubt dissolve in smoke , and you will be aware of your existence , even if the Earth is spinning on the axis of evil . it becomes clear to you that you are trapped between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone around stone .
they have arrested me and my father three times , but that was not enough for me to &quot; learn my lesson &quot; as the Chief of the Security Service stated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he proved his power over us by even destroying the simplest concepts we knew .
five teenagers were ri@@ pped during a peaceful protest as we@@ eds from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
it was enough for the city to sh@@ atter the darkness of the night with &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; scre@@ ams .
all quarters were cov@@ eted , only my own did not .
for the first time it was quiet , mo@@ tion@@ less , at the wrong time , even if I had no high demands on a city that has been stuff@@ ed up to the arter@@ ies with state safety organisms and their accompli@@ ces .
in the third night things had cal@@ med down after the power supply stopped functioning in the neighborhood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I broke through the silence by shou@@ ting several times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from my roof . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I heard my voice resist@@ ed by silence .
a few minutes later , some of my friends felt brave enough to work together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me ; we united to a magnificent picture that filled my expectations completely .
in such a moment you are aware that you liber@@ ate the Spirit from the lamp , but you simply don &apos;t care in the slightest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he laid up .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low , nothing can return your voice after you scre@@ amed it all the way to the office of the Security Service out of the body .
I arrived there .
the Col@@ onel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the colon@@ el Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me also hear how you cry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or you are only brave enough to scre@@ am if we are not near . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his hat@@ eful eyes focused on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you dare to look into my eyes and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I was standing in front of this building .
perhaps it was on my foo@@ li@@ sh@@ ness , vanity , perhaps at the revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was so sure of my thing when I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wouldn &apos;t have thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I think I never stopped looking into my eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I don &apos;t regret a word of what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put him in sol@@ itary confin@@ ement with his father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his father is equal to that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cursed movement lies in my nose until today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a mental torture I was exposed for months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I crossed the courtyard .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with myself .
then again through the courtyard and into the second office , which leads through a passage to the individual cells .
I show all the details exactly before I enter the room .
other than usual , they probably gave me a larger cell .
I have to share it with one other prisoner and may put me immediately without waiting for permission .
after a few minutes , feeling like a whole life , the officer left the cell , and I stepped back to an old tried method of communication : beating with the fist against the wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my cell @-@ mate was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ear@@ th@@ bug &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation , he finally answered me .
apparently , in none of the surrounding cells was a respected middle @-@ aged man , who looks like me and is called &quot; the doctor . &quot;
in the perfect darkness , no distinctive features can be seen on me , and doctors don &apos;t exist here ; we are all only numbers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe someone , whose voice sounds like mine ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the answers deny his existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the large cells .
perhaps he will be inter@@ rog@@ ated immediately .
the investig@@ ator had assured me that they would release him if I remained .
LÃ¼@@ g@@ ner .
I would have liked to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to drive all these crow@@ s that are lab@@ elled on the fruits in my head &apos;s garden .
from the distance I still hear them scre@@ aming &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar . &quot;
it must be around 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the cri@@ es catch , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black is the colour of per@@ dition , until I saw the yellow light that showed us horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; th@@ under , &quot; all@@ usion to the 13th pro@@ stitute of the Koran ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are here to be heard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to protect the state security against us and to prevent us from releasing the tra@@ itor and the terrorists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dialect - so they played their sec@@ t@@ arian black@@ mail and betra@@ yed the close view of their world view .
this is not a house , this is not a land ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to transform the criminal of their c@@ lans into a hero .
I enter the audi@@ torium and meet Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and stock@@ y man ; at least he seems to me like that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he starts a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant conversation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite the facial expressions that gli@@ de him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start as much more important with your life than to join this day and protest on demonstrations that will soon come to an end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not answer .
I got used to it , not to reply .
I can &apos;t really say exactly when ins@@ ults and pun@@ ches have become an ordinary means of communication for me after a friendly conversation .
when and how that happened was un@@ important .
some voice in me told me that I had to get used to being punished , even though I did nothing to deserve this punishment .
on punishment in all their diversity .
his command is to tear me as much flesh as possible from the body .
he calls this aff@@ ection@@ ate &quot; confession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube that probably comes from the clo@@ aca .
your exec@@ ution@@ er rejo@@ ices at your scre@@ ams .
give him pleasure , you cannot judge with him , and you cannot hold back your cry .
my scre@@ ams didn &apos;t hurt him yet , so they inter@@ changed the tube through a cable .
at my first arrest , I asked if the investig@@ ator had worked as a garbage collector , or if that was part of the normal work equipment .
they had inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables inter@@ tw@@ ined in order to present us the great invention of a huge cable from their point of view .
within a single hour three of them altern@@ ated while I was still in the row .
I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I stopped crying out .
the exec@@ ution@@ er re@@ marked the cooling down and did not find any fav@@ ours , so he moved next to an electrically charged stick .
power flow@@ ed across my whole body , enough to supply my whole neighborhood .
my half @-@ naked body lying on the ground was the perfect conductor .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was there again .
after two terrible hours , he ruled that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
this must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
some hours went by , which happened to me as minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ aus with dir , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted youth : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my Father must be fear@@ ful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be quiet and go away , you will be moved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had always released me .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian ra@@ pper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of LG@@ BT@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time indoors , sometimes he sl@@ um@@ ps to his screen , sometimes to his computer , sometimes to his couch .
but what one can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips inf@@ ested with ni@@ cot@@ ine .
he lives in the top@@ most storey of his family house , which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year that Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and forced H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family to escape from their village in Palestine , in which they lived as a rock @-@ ye@@ en ( about : Far@@ mer ) .
for six years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist opposing the conservative majority and questioned their well @-@ established opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ es@@ eed music .
with his music , which often deals with topics like Ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also calls for the core of the entire Arab world . all these issues are not only relevant in his hom@@ etown of Am@@ man , but also in cities ranging from Damascus in Syria to Yemen in Yemen .
with his 25 years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not limited in his thinking by borders , and he can feel with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he does not openly admit it , he won a special dis@@ like against U.S. foreign policy .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those trying to survive in war zones , to do anything with his identity as a &quot; Palestinian refugee of the second generation , &quot; he calls himself , even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think about my own circumstances , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b stresses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then he adds : &quot; I think so , because I &apos;m a man , &quot; while he sh@@ ook into two cups in water sol@@ dered Nes@@ cafÃ© . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan ; during this time it is planned for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset .
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food is illegal during Ram@@ adan .
apparently H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with age @-@ old traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee on a sil@@ ently hot young day has little to do with protest against Islam .
basically , the pieces of lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the swa@@ ths of the K@@ ent @-@ cigarette in the nose speak primarily of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky , especially if you take a look at the neighbouring countries .
therefore it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ram@@ adan to drink water - not to land in prison .
recently , the Ministry of the Interior , Jordan , announced a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , for the second time already .
some MPs who support the Islamic action front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ exual front singer , Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o , contradic@@ ts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the concert announcement .
in an interview with CN@@ N , the MPs and former spokes@@ woman of the Islamic coalition , Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b , said that the concert had been cancelled &quot; just &quot; because of the singer &apos;s sexual orientation .
many also claim that the involvement of the band on issues such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which poses the proven legitim@@ acy of authorit@@ arian regimes across the region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u called the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; progressive supporters of human rights &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; who continued to vote &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this statement should probably not be simply sei@@ z@@ ure rhet@@ oric , but actually reflects an increasingly clear and cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan , which clearly appears in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s oeu@@ vre .
in 2016 H@@ da@@ i@@ b returned to traditional gender norms by making his vision of the fate of Arab women who have mar@@ ital sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of a clearly tro@@ dden unknown woman whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the screen .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they really should trust .
over the past few years , the number of &quot; honorary mor@@ es &quot; has increased in Jordan , leaving the in@@ official outside .
according to Human Rights Watch , the number of volunteers in 2016 reached its peak ; however , it is still ag@@ grav@@ ating that Jordan has failed to support institutional infrastructure in order to support women who attempted murder or domestic violence .
according to a law on crime control from 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can be imprisoned for in@@ definite time in prison , &quot; and for her release is often necessary for years of bureaucratic expenditure and the guarantee by the family that nothing will happen to the woman .
also H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s music enjoys great popularity and is well @-@ known to not shy away from issues that long as tab@@ oo in his country .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but ad@@ mits that he cannot divor@@ ce his music , which is full of explicit references to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was smu@@ g@@ gled into politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b tackl@@ es the question of Palestinian identity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the focus is again on poverty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the list of songs that are political at the core can be continued .
in March 2016 H@@ da@@ i@@ b released a song called &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse is repeated often :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the further course of the song H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market where you can get what you want &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality .
he notices that there is hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay men and les@@ bi@@ ans and that comment@@ aries on gender equality have been heavily cens@@ ored by 2014 .
in 2014 H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Y@@ ord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya , to later remember that his comments were torn , distorted and cens@@ ored in his opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Youtube , it was uploaded without any cuts , but stre@@ amed only a edited version , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today H@@ da@@ i@@ b adverti@@ ses the Arabic LG@@ BT@@ Q + community and believes that intoler@@ ance to homosexu@@ als does not justify Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ it , a poet of the eighth century , who is still remembered today thanks to his homo@@ erotic poetry .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ something , who was to work later on behalf of the cali@@ ph , could openly write about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ ani@@ ans not do that ?
the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ y kingdom there is nothing new anymore that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced .
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service held several former government deleg@@ ations and members of the teacher &apos;s association , argu@@ ing that they had cri@@ tically expressed themselves cri@@ tically on social media comments related to the deeply rooted corruption in the country .
in view of this , H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s opinion is only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans .
for him progress is a constant giving and taking . Jordan has now denied M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - this is how it sees H@@ da@@ i@@ b - consists of slow , thought and inner changes .
ultimately , H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experiencing them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the region will be able to approach a real and fundamental openness by means of music , art and literature - and not by bombs , cluster muni@@ tions and democr@@ atically @-@ induced demo@@ cra@@ cies . at least he hopes this .
until the time has come , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to ra@@ p and therefore resist .

N@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
these big , extravag@@ ant warri@@ or dolls are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta festival .
it is presum@@ ed that it is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory states that the ball@@ ast , the drums and dancing came over more than a thousand years and come from a period when armies from west Japan mar@@ ched into the northeast to force the indigenous people of the region , the E@@ mis@@ hi , to the knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to pick up some great seats , so we have a great view .
it is hard to imagine how large these parts are ...
a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ yo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally ) .
I have been looking for the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ yo@@ en for a long time : two solid cars are just to be seen .
nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend the summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Sommer@@ festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ uch@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of an 18 metre high fe@@ ather was unbelievable .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !
young Peru@@ vi@@ ans exchange weapons against sciss@@ ors and straight raz@@ ors

out@@ ward appearance and personal care were as important as in this story , because they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth away from crime and to promote a legitimate profession like that of the hair@@ dresser .
El Call@@ ao , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of Lima - a region with a very high crime rate , where street rob@@ ber@@ y and illegal drug traffi@@ cking are everyday .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region do not feel safe .
at the same time Peru , like many other medi@@ um@@ - and South American countries , experienced an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend , appearance , and therefore also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sports@@ men such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( Chile ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) has led to more and more normal citizens moving into the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers who can recre@@ ate these elaborate hair@@ styles .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 .
there experts compete against each other to show who of them can create the most ec@@ centric looks , as you can see in the following video ( further videos on current cont@@ ests are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy School , located in El Call@@ ao , found an opportunity to persu@@ ade young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and to receive training in hair@@ dressing art , which allows them to find work .
motivated by this activity and the possibilities offered , dozens of you@@ ths have seen that they can take a job which is currently in fashion .
prior to the school year beginning in March , the school offered special training workshops and reported on some of their successes :
in 1995 we were the only school in the community and the district where we are very proud , because out of love for the children we have built this educational community .
Colombia : letter of love to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters
photo : Valent@@ ina Mon@@ sal@@ ve .
use with kind permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the following article is the edited version of the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Love messages to guer@@ illa fighters &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve released . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the article is published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people we know ?
isn &apos;t it still much more important to accommodate people who feel ej@@ ected ?
this is exactly what the two young Colom@@ bian activ@@ ist Leonardo P@@ Ã¡r@@ ra@@ ga from the Bog@@ ot@@ Art Foundation and Cris@@ tian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation inspired her to the campaign Cart@@ as p@@ or la @-@ li@@ aciÃ³n ( letters to reconciliation ) that encourage young people to write letters to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters .
only recently their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to it : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government signed a peace treaty with the F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary Ar@@ med Forces of Colombia ) , which constitutes the final point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
the signing of the peace treaty was so significant that the Colom@@ bian president Jose Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its .
before the Colom@@ bian people , there is still a long way to talk about real reconciliation and peace .
guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , who have lived in illegal camps for many years , were exposed to war rhet@@ oric and were carrying out their arms round the clock , must now re @-@ integrate into life as civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society , in turn , accustomed itself to life in constant fear and in some cases of profound hatred toward guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , must now take in its ranks and support them in building up a new life .
Leonardo and Cris@@ tian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bi@@ ans had to join together and help in the integration process .
and that is exactly what they did : until now thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters to welcome them back into society .
the goal of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former guer@@ illa fighter - to be handed over personally .
Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as Inspiration for the Camp@@ aig@@ n
the idea for the letters to reconciliation was created at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bog@@ ot@@ Ã¡ in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cris@@ tian had the opportunity to talk briefly to K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love on Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day , but forget those who need much more need@@ less .
he planned to share his love with people this year , which needed most urgent attention .
thus arose the plan to write letters full of hope and support for former F@@ ARC comb@@ at@@ ants who now have to find their place in society and build a new life . &quot; the letters will show that Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a war story a common history of peace , &quot; they say .
up to now more than 2000 letters have been collected during the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia , such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ Ã­n , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ Ã¡ .
&apos;@@ i never thought someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on March 19 .
a group of 40 students from Ja@@ veri@@ ana University in Cal@@ i , two members of the Municip@@ ality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Bog@@ ot@@ Art Foundation travelled to the camp to personally transfer the letters .
the F@@ ARC members put themselves in the way they had done earlier in order to accept the orders of their leaders .
but this time they did not receive orders , but letters full of encour@@ agement from people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and all that lies in between , &quot; told the political science student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ Ã©@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the Gover@@ nor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca described this unforgettable experience like this :
after passing the letters , a former warri@@ or led me through the camp of the guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the guer@@ ri@@ llas live ) , I saw a guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter who wrote something .
I was afraid to go , because next to him on the bed was a M@@ GL @-@ Gran@@ at@@ werfer , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hello , what are you doing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer a letter that someone wrote to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; someone has never written such a beautiful thing in my life , so I answer it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the tears ran across the che@@ eks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I hu@@ g@@ ged him very tightly and sat down beside the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ates .
perhaps he was also tired of the war , was tired of being the faithful companion of this fighter all the years and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything else from life than war . joining the F@@ ARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers from star@@ vation . &quot; I never thought anyone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a society there that wa@@ its for us with open arms .
until now , I have only learned how to deal with weapons .
but now where peace reig@@ ns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices and voices
for the pr@@ el@@ ude , students and a few leaders of the F@@ ARC have joined a discussion round .
the students were all grown up as already war and the F@@ ARC had already acted in secret .
for this reason , the F@@ ARC leaders declared the history of the organization , their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have experienced how social injustice on the part of the state exer@@ ted on the whole of the Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the possibility of developing ourselves into a political party , we can help shape society in this country more equ@@ itably .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a purpose of this magnitude , it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
to hear these people who never heard anything heard and had no right to vote , and to realize that the people I often had seen as a monster and even hated , were only people with beautiful feelings turned around by their living conditions and their environment was very painful for me .
the reality in which the country lives , hur@@ ts me .
but it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and caused so much damage , can teach us something and give us a smile and a hu@@ g .
many former fighters have replied to the letters .
Gust@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez , the camp &apos;s commander in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , for example wrote Dar@@ Ã­@@ o de Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Archbishop of the city of Cal@@ i , wrote the following letter :
the Colom@@ bian was prophes@@ ied that there would be peace after dis@@ armament .
but this is not the case .
as long as there is ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people willing to resort to arms , rise up and protest for their rights . and that is also fully justified ( ... ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we of the F@@ ARC are now focusing on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore we call all def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in the war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and make sacrifices because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties .
there will be many obstacles on our way , but together we will overcome them .

hom@@ os@@ exual and que@@ er people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
with terror activists have witnessed the reporting of recent months over the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat posed by the LG@@ BT@@ Q community on the LG@@ BT@@ Q community there has not only emerged overnight .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ z@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is currently happening in the Republic .
the LG@@ BT@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya took over the international head@@ lines several months ago , when reports were published that address the deportation , torture and killing of que@@ er men in the Republic .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ lam@@ ina in the Now@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities who arrested susp@@ icious que@@ er men and put them in secret pris@@ ons in gun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you brought a monster to the world &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a Trans@@ wife , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny and grew up there .
since childhood she felt that she was really a woman .
when she grew up she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , so she moved to Moscow .
after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens had learned about the sex equ@@ ation of their country woman , the hunt for Sab@@ rina was opened .
out of fear of her life she finally moved to the USA .
Sab@@ rina : I worked as a hel@@ per in a human rights organisation .
one day I was told that someone needed my help .
it was a friend from D@@ age@@ stan , a Trans@@ wife who was in trouble .
she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , someone I thought would be a friend , a copy of my documents , and spread it all over the internet , with my telephone number and a picture of me . he sent her to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya that can eliminate this shame ? &quot;
after that the photos of my documents made the round through W@@ hat@@ s@@ App .
on 10 October 2015 , I was attacked .
when I was doing a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying , &quot; Here &apos;s a gift for you from your unc@@ le . &quot;
when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but nothing hurt me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time in Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long do you still want to dish@@ on@@ our the family , you shame ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I just know that it was a young man , not 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and finally woke up in the hospital .
apparently some women had heard everything and started scre@@ aming .
the man fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
in hospital , I learned that I had two st@@ ings in my right lung .
OC Media : in which health wings were you placed - in the men or women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are ob@@ sol@@ ete , my male name is still on it ; but the doctor understood and laid me at the women .
I am very thank@@ ful for this .
when I first read his name at his office , I was afraid to do it ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name .
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him for being respect@@ ful of me .
I spent more than a month in hospital .
last February I received threats .
they called me and wrote me - relatives , foreigners , some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
they asked me to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that it was all a lie .
they made absurd demands : some told me that I had to prove it by running on the top without going through the streets ; others wanted me to appear in Gro@@ z@@ ny &apos;s official TV and say that I didn &apos;t change my sex , that everything was just bad , and Photos@@ hop .
I have grain size C - what should I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family attempt to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for them .
some elderly people once spoke to my mother on the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They have brought a monster to the world that has not only damaged your family , but the whole republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my mother was too much and she put a rope around her neck .
luckily the neighbors came and saved them .
I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved into a flat and a few hours later , under the window , there was a car with dark@@ ened windows and a number plate with a 95 .
after it had happened for the third time , I realized that there was a bit la@@ zy .
my human rights activists verified the number plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with her help I left the country , but then something incredible happened .
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before leaving Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived .
I bought them without registering , without identification , without anything .
I broke my old SIM card and threw her into the garbage .
arrived and checked in at the hotel .
the number was registered on a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
in the moment when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t think you &apos;re in security just because you &apos;ve left the country ?
our people know already in which hotel you &apos;re in . you even know your room number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only to prove it to you : it is the number 115 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
can you imagine that ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
however , we do not talk about gender equality , this is a tab@@ oo subject .
some traditionally Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements I carry still in me .
as much as I wish , I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her .
when we chat with camera , I really try to look at the person they remember from their past - so to my male form .
but this is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends do , those who have stayed d@@ ort@@ lessly ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report last week in Washington .
for him , I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information on the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I spoke to someone who sat in ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
he told us that during Ram@@ adan there were no people arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he did not shut out a new wave .
most likely they will now focus on family and relatives .
so I mean they probably charge the relatives who care about the problem with the person concerned and at the end demand evidence that the so called &quot; honor &quot; has experienced through blood satisfaction .
OC Media : are gay men still held in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine tells me there are not so many .
if , then , especially those who have no rich relatives or who were dropped by their relatives to put themselves on the cad@@ ets of Cad@@ y@@ rows .
as far as I know , they are held there so that they can be presented as terrorists later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they are killed , they will show their bodies on television and claim they have attacked any village or military base . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
as if these people were not simply disappeared , they were specifically sub@@ merged in order to radic@@ alise .
OC Media : is that just a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was imprisoned in ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after having grown beard .
there has been nothing new since then .
they just took them along .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was himself when these people were taken with him .
until now , however , they were not presented as ban@@ dits , there have been no reports so far . however , we suspect that such actions are quite possible .
why would you not have allowed these people to shave ?
do you know whether these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people belonging to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already taken place in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think already before 2003 I was already known in Gro@@ z@@ ny when I still lived there - and I never had any problems .
in the seri@@ ousness !
even from 1998 to 1999 when the Sh@@ aria was considered , I never had any problems .
on the contrary , at that time it was much safer than it is now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia was originally intended to bring us to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civili@@ sing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but ultimately threw us back into the Stone Age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had colored eyel@@ ashes , wore tub@@ ular jeans and short tops .
the Ministry of Security of Sh@@ aria has never scrat@@ ched me just one hair .
before the Russian theater in Gro@@ z@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , met a whole group of people like me .
it was a small place where several banks were standing , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there .
we have never been insul@@ ted .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; Don &apos;t worry about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
people often say it to children when they laugh at the sick .
OC Media : so they simply closed their eyes to you because they thought you were sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they have never offen@@ ded me , never hun@@ ted and never struck me .
OC Media : how long did this time of grace last ?
Sab@@ rina : until Kad@@ y@@ row stepped on the plan .
when he was appointed prime minister in 2005 , he began talking about morality in television .
he spoke not about us per se but primarily about the behavior of women .
nevertheless - you could feel how people began to change in the city .
those who had smil@@ ed and laugh@@ ed at first looked at you with suspici@@ on .
in that time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home I could feel the situation in the republic continuously worse .
OC Media : what activity do you do now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn a lot - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US .
apart from that , I am still active as an activ@@ ist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organize te@@ et@@ re@@ es , meetings , I accompany them to the hospital and help them to get food @-@ cards .
I don &apos;t spend a cent for it .
I discovered these people myself when I par@@ ap@@ hr@@ ased breeding places .
I am Muslims and want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : this is a mystery .
so is nature , that has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same thing as Ch@@ echn@@ ya , who want to make you white with foam before the mouth that there are no ga@@ ys on them .
the D@@ age@@ stan@@ ans have which , the Cab@@ ard@@ ines , who , the Russians have , which , on the whole planet , there are they - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I come from there , so it &apos;s unpleasant for me to hear something like that .
I meet so many men here from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practicing Muslims walking into the mos@@ que and fasting during Ram@@ adan - live with men .
you know , many think in transition to men who love males , and they believe that man changes his gender to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a fall@@ acy .
these are two different things - two different kinds of feeling to be exact , different attitudes of life .
for me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
sorry that I become so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago .
and I &apos;m not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself .
local groups warn against an increase in suicide within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
since the last few months there has been a strong increase in suicide .
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ Amaz@@ i on August 27 drew the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran that is marked by poverty and unemployment , in the spotlight .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al Tha@@ w@@ ra in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region in the south @-@ west of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , the inability to pay for his family , according to Ah@@ wa@@ zi human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous .
a video shared on YouTube kept the moments after he had kind@@ led himself .
some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the fl@@ ames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was taken to the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , the burns were so strong that doctors could no longer do anything .
he died short time later .
it was not the only suicide that occurred within the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi @-@ Min@@ ority in August , and activists warn that even more men could take life .
the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im .
their stories have one thing in common : they were all family fathers , who were hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families due to the persecution by the Iranian government , and to pursue a safe work .
Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , where most of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community living in Iran is based , has been sha@@ ken by a profound economic crisis that makes it hard for the native Arab population to deny its livel@@ ihood .
a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ la@@ vi Mon@@ archy took power in 1925 and took great efforts to end ethnic autonomy in Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran , as well as some of the most profitable and valuable useful areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop only slowly , and the local population receives little from this wealth .
it is often the victim of untreated illnesses , hunger and priv@@ ation .
the Iranian regime systematically refuse the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Arabs to work systematically in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government also built a multitude of dam@@ s , the waters from the Arab territories in the Persian areas , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m are lying .
these dam@@ s have only led to ag@@ grav@@ ate the devast@@ ation caused by dr@@ y@@ ness and destroy the local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ haw@@ ks now rose to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian Director General for Co@@ operative , Labour and Social Wel@@ fare , reported that 5 % of the Ah@@ wa@@ z@@ is who are looking for a job , completed elementary school , completed 55 % secondary school and 45 % completed a university degree .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; systematic strategy ... aimed at crus@@ hing the spirit of national resistance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ zi human rights activ@@ ist resi@@ ding in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination , &quot; led to a &quot; high rise &quot; in the number of suicide among young Ah@@ wa@@ zi men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans emerging in Ah@@ wa@@ z and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recruitment process : &quot; &quot; &quot;
because officials and institutions do not favour Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime aimed at anni@@ hil@@ ating the spirit of national resistance to young Arabs and forcing them to earn their livel@@ ihood outside their home .
there are people who had to change their first name and sur@@ name in order to hide their belonging to the Ah@@ wa@@ zi and be questioned as even Arab names at the workplace are not tolerated , let alone speaking the Arabic language or wearing Arabian clothing .
given the circumstances the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi has to endure , human rights activists suggest alarm before the situation becomes explosive .
it remains to be seen whether the world is w@@ aking up and taking notice of it .
the main reason for suicide is depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why I don &apos;t identify myself with femin@@ ism , also with the inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ als ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and was originally published on Af@@ ro@@ f@@ Ã©@@ min@@ as website .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
when I say I &apos;m not a femin@@ ist , many women - especially white women who call themselves inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - respond with fru@@ stration .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even lay well thought @-@ out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a femin@@ ist and why we should generally be all femin@@ ist * inside .
for example , women nowadays earn less money today despite equal education than men .
that women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
that violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
or that cultural and social norms always ensure that women sooner or later encounter a glass ceiling in various spheres of life , and that discrimination based on gender is still moving across the many different countries and beliefs .
all of this is aware and known to me .
I am convinced of this and I suffer twice and thre@@ ef@@ old under it .
I am a black woman .
and yet , when I come to talk about skin color , on racism , on black women women , black women in LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I mention how we &apos;ve always been ab@@ used physically , emo@@ tionally and verb@@ ally , both in and outside the femin@@ ist movement , many white fem@@ inists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists decide to remain silent .
but nevertheless all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; lift their voices and &quot; to sing &quot; my Lord &quot; to reach equal rights ( some ) of women .
but they don &apos;t want to talk about sexu@@ alized violence in addition to an institution@@ alised form of rac@@ ist motivated violence that we are subjected to black women in two ways .
or that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and places of origin earn less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with an immigration background can often be referred to school as white girls due to obvious integration problems .
or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in the partnership than white women .
on the one hand , I want all women to have all men and all men of all skin color the same rights ; on the other hand , I can &apos;t join a movement as a black woman who refuses to take into account injus@@ tices in her mind , which refer to gender as well as the skin color of a person .
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my belonging in a white femin@@ ist oriented sphere that has rejected me and countless other black women over and over again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; So@@ jour@@ n compl@@ ained in her speech in 18@@ 51 : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is in a historical sense an un@@ men@@ ded and margin@@ alized being . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I refuse to join groups who also absorb our customs and customs by cultural appropri@@ ation in order to advance their eg@@ oc@@ entri@@ c program .
I will no longer attempt to suggest white women the importance of overl@@ apping skin color and sex , for some of them will continue to remain silent on the importance of black women for the femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women are trying to reward them for the better .
although the inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ale femin@@ ism was founded in order to give women of different origins a home and isol@@ ate oneself from the white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; still lies in its name .
I prefer to get rid of femin@@ ism and join the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which was created for my dark skin and my status as a woman , rather than using me for a white femin@@ ist paradigm that is so stub@@ born that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever that we black women define us according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us .
Cl@@ ark@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ cana wom@@ anism : rec@@ laim@@ ing ( such as : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ismus : as we re@@ conquer ourselves ) speaks of the fact that we can defend ourselves in this way , in which they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , emotional , physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped , which make up the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists are immediately calling separ@@ atism and exclusion after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is affected .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment , I can raise black women and women of other cultures because in this paradigm I exist .
I am recognized as a part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and my being as a woman .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment where my life has neither passed , nor ignored , nor rejected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
p@@ add@@ ling against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations
this contribution by To@@ d@@ d Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports in@@ particular about international efforts to solve environmental problems .
in the context of a content @-@ sharing agreement , this article will be re@@ published here .
again and again Nab@@ il Mus@@ a traveled in Iraq over the past 7 years - mostly with a sur@@ f@@ board or a can@@ oe - with a special concern for the region of Kurdist@@ an in Iraq . its mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations .
in this documentary by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who explains to us his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his church .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I absolutely wanted to do something for the river we had lost when I was still a child , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mus@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development , will lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organization Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Iraq - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance - who works to protect rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq and to support local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video Mus@@ a summari@@ zes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work on one question : &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was produced , filmed and published for En@@ sia by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , an Er@@ bil @-@ based documentary film@@ maker and multimedia journalist .
the focus of her work is on persecuted , poorly paid sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of co@@ oper@@ ative vide@@ ography and new multimedia techniques , with help supp@@ ressed municipalities to tell their stories in their own way .
Paragu@@ ays Women and their difficult fight against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; a group of women represent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crying women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to express their pain on the women &apos;s mur@@ ders in the country and in the region and show their rejection . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is the shortened and edited version of the article &quot; The Wave of Viol@@ ence Ag@@ ainst Women in Paraguay &quot; by Struc@@ tural . the article is part of the series # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # female ) reported about the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect affected persons .
a police commission@@ er told A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez that she could not do anything against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ husband , who had become violent against her .
since the end of their relationship , some time has gone by and the police said that their statement would be laid to the files , but more could not be done .
as another Mrs. Bal@@ bu@@ ena pointed out for ill @-@ treatment , A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez &apos; informed display did nothing .
a few days later , the second woman pulled her ad back .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
in general , if women give an ad at all , they generally do not receive support from the state .
in many cases , women are also financially dependent on the men they abuse . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence must be reported to the law enforcement authorities at all .
content 1 Batter@@ ies and stati@@ stic 2 In@@ visible mal@@ treatment and a legal system that has nothing to do with Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , lack of implementation impacts and statistics
it is difficult to determine how many women are really mi@@ stre@@ ated , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aciÃ³n y E@@ studios , a research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are various information and reports that do not even show the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; she explains .
however , the numbers available are alar@@ ming .
in 2015 , the District At@@ tor@@ ney Office filed 9@@ 600 advertisements for domestic violence . 70 % of them were violence against women .
86 % of the ads in the police came from women .
there were more than 5,000 advertisements for domestic violence in the courts of peace . also here 86 % of the ads were reported by women .
in the adver@@ ts 40 % of women said that they were physically ab@@ used , 55 % of women spoke of mental abuse .
these statistics do not , however , show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an women &apos;s minister , Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only a few of these crimes are actually shown . &quot; for every woman who is ref@@ unded in Paraguay for psychological abuse , 9 women who do not do this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for every woman who is reimbur@@ sed for physical abuse , two women who do not do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she declared at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the murder of women in Paraguay is not a crime , the law enforcement agencies cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners .
by August 2016 alone , journalists included at least 12 cases of murder in the country .
the coordinator for human rights in Paraguay has documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies due to violence by men .

invisible abuse and a judicial system that does not under@@ mine anything
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ Ã­@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insist@@ ed that she called him the names of all her former friends .
in the beginning she didn &apos;t want it , but then gave up . this should be regre@@ t@@ ted forever .
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer met with Carlos . but for two years she endu@@ red psych@@ ic violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult one :
I never thought I would once have been a victim of abuse .
when I read about it earlier , I always thought that it only happened to women who are too sub@@ servi@@ ent , because they are fo@@ ol@@ ed by violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report ab@@ uses by Carlos Vera .
without nam@@ ing names , she wrote articles on Facebook where she described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated her .
many people responded to their contributions , among them Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically whether he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she had fallen from Carlos for so long and did not leave him earlier .
it seemed almost as if they wanted to say that the victims of abuse had at least some kind of complic@@ ity in it .
Victoria San@@ tos , who does not come from Paraguay , fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner was ab@@ using her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o te Cre@@ o network ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe to you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) consisting of women who are all victims of abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the group they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not : they take the women &apos;s statements seriously .
in Vict@@ ori@@ as , everything started with mental abuse .
her wealthy partner eventually even managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat them .
Vict@@ ori@@ as ads with the authorities remained without result and also from their relatives , she received no support .
she led a trial against her former partner , who developed into an im@@ penet@@ r@@ able legal struggle between Paraguay and her home country , where it was mainly about money , power , and the influence of her former partner .
Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , lack of implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good but cannot be applied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the display of abuse is a way of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organisation for women in Paraguay , also sees major problems in the application of laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a draft law was deb@@ ated at the Paragu@@ ay@@ an parliament , which was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ el@@ as ( # for you ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Min@@ os movement ( # non @-@ L@@ ess ) are part of a campaign on Twitter which is supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original draft of the law proposes that Fem@@ ini@@ d would declare to be an independent criminal offen@@ se and punish it harder than it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
thus the law text was modified in some points in order to also win the de@@ pu@@ ties for the law , which feared that the path for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions would be lev@@ elled , which is currently prohibited in Paraguay and be pen@@ alised with up to five years imprisonment .
the original bill was intended to cost the majority of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) process costs which the victims of violence currently have to bear , if they just want to reimbur@@ se ad and get a secure accommodation to the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient financial resources for it :
in Paraguay , abuse is seen as part of inter@@ personal relationships .
here a re@@ thinking of violence must take place so that violence is no longer regarded as something normal .
those who remain silent in the face of these facts are complic@@ it and contribute to the perpetr@@ ators being punished .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must reimbur@@ se for such a long time until mal@@ treatment is no longer considered normal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 10 November 2016 , the law was passed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . prior to that , parts of the law were changed , among other things a passage that the partners called for reconciliation in cases of domestic violence .
the opinions on the changes are going to be different .
the Section for Rec@@ on@@ ci@@ liation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack its victim again .
the cancellation of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political force &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law however is considered to be a great set@@ back .
this article is the shortened and edited version of the article &quot; The Wave of Viol@@ ence Ag@@ ainst Women in Paraguay &quot; by Struc@@ tural . the article is part of the series # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # female ) reported about the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect affected persons .
independent media in Oman once more exposed to attacks a year after bann@@ ing a newspaper
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was blocked due to a resolution by the Minister of Information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the homepage of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a year ago , the Catalan authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n for their coverage of corruption in the sult@@ an .
You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison , serving a one @-@ year prison sentence .
two other investig@@ ators from Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and tried for trial , but later they were released .
Oman has been ruled by Sult@@ an Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid since 1970 , who came to power after having stab@@ bed his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup d &quot; Ã©@@ tat .
since then , in addition to his role as the only sult@@ an , he has been suffering the most important positions in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Commander of the Defence Forces , Minister of Finance , Minister of Foreign Affairs , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the Sult@@ an &apos;s rule is marked by the persistent efforts of the security forces , in particular domestic trade , the public fre@@ edoms , including freedom of the press , cur@@ tail@@ ing and incar@@ cer@@ ating human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities systematically restrict peaceful and legitimate activities in the area of human rights and prevent citizens , including activists , to voice their views on the country &apos;s public affairs , such as corruption in authorities and institutions online and offline . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the attack on Az@@ am@@ n newspaper , its closing and imprisonment of three of its editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper in which since its inc@@ eption in 2007 , it was reported on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , noted that an article entitled &quot; High @-@ ranking parties tied hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary &quot; was published in the newspaper on July 26 , 2016 .
in the report , government officials were accused of having put pressure on judges of the Supreme Court in Oman by claiming a verdict in an inheritance dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n of July 26 , 2016 with a report on the title page with the title : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ ranking parties bind the hands of justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , a member of the editorial board , was invited by the ISS to the special department and arrested on his arrival by the security forces .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS received the deputy chief editor You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who had acted as editor @-@ in @-@ chief after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is arrest .
the newspaper was closed in@@ definitely after the Minister of Information provided the statement that &quot; publication and dissemination of the newspaper is prohibited on any way , including online , from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
the first trial in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i took place in Mas@@ k@@ at on 26 September 2016 .
the Court condemned the three journalists to prison sentences and also ordered the final closing of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both convic@@ ted for dis@@ ruption of public order , &quot; mis@@ use of the Internet , &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining the pres@@ tige of the state . &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of violation of a public ban and slan@@ der .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years imprisonment and fin@@ es of 3@@ 800 US dollars each . in addition , a one @-@ year prohibition of occupation against the two journalists was imposed .
al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) , after he was found guilty of using &quot; an information network to distribute material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
a damage deposit of $ 5000 was fixed for Al @-@ Abr@@ i and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016 before the pron@@ ounc@@ ement of judgment .
the Appe@@ als Court acqu@@ itted Al @-@ Abr@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , however , Al @-@ Ha@@ j sentenced to a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari to six months in prison .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 following his 6 @-@ month prison sentence from the central prison in Mas@@ k@@ at . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison where he served his first prison term .
the Court of Appe@@ al also rev@@ oked the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
despite the court &apos;s decision to allow Az@@ am@@ n again , the newspaper continues to face attacks by the government of Palestine .
on 8 January the Minister of Information issued a statement by which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed a further statement in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , and with which the minister once again appe@@ aled the decision of the Appe@@ als Court to re @-@ publish the publication of the newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which Oman has recently injured the freedom of the press . &quot; &quot; &quot;
further violations , for example , include closure of the website of the independent journal M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the country &apos;s first independent online newspaper to stop its operation .
due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the imprisonment of journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression arises that the Iranian authorities are still un@@ willing to end the extensive violation of press freedom .
the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls on the authorities to :
1 . immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally release You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j ;
2. create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n so that their journalists can pursue their work ;
3 . protect freedom of the press in the country and
4 . in all circumstances , ensuring that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman have un@@ hin@@ dered their legitimate human rights work , and without fear of ret@@ ali@@ atory measures , including legal ch@@ ic@@ ans .
the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organisation serving human rights def@@ enders ( including independent journalists , blo@@ ggers , lawyers etc . ) in the Gulf region and in neighboring countries by promoting freedom of opinion and association , as well as the right to assemble , support and protect themselves peac@@ efully .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , picture takes place with his consent
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need for medical research performed on site : on the one hand , many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent are lacking in the offer of global healthcare .
diseases like AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria have far more serious effects in Africa &apos;s poor@@ est countries than elsewhere , and lack of investment for research on these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem .
second , the research carried out by African researchers helps to build own research capacities in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Central Laboratory at the Center for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , CI@@ DR@@ Z ) .
he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia in the 1990s , when the AIDS epide@@ mic showed first serious implications for national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana .
as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself resear@@ ched the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the S@@ Ã¡@@ mi health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research .
( disclaim@@ er : Dr. War@@ rier is a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work lies on the application of research results . I support the S@@ Ã¡@@ mi National Programme for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition , I am currently starting a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens .
what do you think are the most important current science topics in your country and in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
that has to change , otherwise we will always be recipients , rather than being a mo@@ ver .
the solutions we get are often not very usable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here .
where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are funded differently .
it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries .
GM : what is the research infrastructure ?
what are the obstacles in your routine research work you didn &apos;t have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries .
what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there is interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
GM : what is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it focus on , and how can we support the development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is need for special scientific training starting at any age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , space exploration , healthcare ( non @-@ communic@@ able and infectious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly .
GM : can you describe the pro@@ s and cons of life as a scientist in Africa compared to Western countries , based on your experience ?
RW : often , it is the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the system that magazines only make articles against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the US to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seed producers change global food production
this article from Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com &apos;s website , a magazine that reports on solutions for environmental problems around the world .
Frank Mort@@ on has been breeding in the USA for the 1980s .
its company offers 114 types of , such as Out@@ right Gor@@ geous , the first plant that has been cultivated and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space .
for almost 20 years , Mort@@ on &apos;s work was limited only by his own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question of how many sorts of let@@ tu@@ ce he can get .
but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use them any further for breeding .
the patents not only g@@ old for individual varieties , but also for specific properties such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green or ch@@ ewed leaves .
over the past few years , more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants , such as cer@@ eal or car@@ rot species . due to this trend , plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts are concerned about food security for the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia old tradition , Mort@@ on still cultiv@@ ates let@@ tu@@ ce , but he now needs longer because his work is increasingly complicated by more and more restrictions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s like a b@@ oul@@ der in a river , around which I have to p@@ addle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have to do that now , but it &apos;s a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think these patents go far too far . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if they stand before judgment , no one can breed a new type of salad , because all the features are already patented . &quot; so he continues to do as good as possible and tries to breed the characteristics that he wants .
however , he is very cau@@ tious and endeav@@ ours to not use any material that is protected as intellectual property .
he has also joined a movement that gets bigger and bigger in the US and all over the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and ta@@ sted red Roman sal@@ at of the Out@@ sh@@ arks variety at the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station . there it is tested whether plants can be cultivated in space .

it is no coincidence that this name may sound more like the movement from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; open source &quot; seeds ) is inspired by the free &quot; open source &quot; software movement that provides alternatives to copy@@ ri@@ ghted software .
it was launched to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and thus can be used permanently for plant breeders .
as part of the initiative , briefly called O@@ ss@@ i , US farmers can commit themselves to the fact that others can freely use the seeds they have bred .
this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it . &quot; open Source &quot; breeders only allow others to breed their seeds in order to breed their own varieties , and not to cut it immediately - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant patents .
dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014 .
glo@@ omy prospects
Professor at the University of Wis@@ cons@@ in @-@ Ma@@ dison and O@@ ss@@ i board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg has control of the seed and the possibility to breed new plants , both important for food security and environmental protection .
according to him , seed plays a role in greater contexts such as biodiversity , farmers &apos; rights , control over the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding sow@@ ing seeds with natural resistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphasizes that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; movement is not concerned with genetically modified plants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all types of plants could be patented whether vegetables , grain , genetically modified or not , from organic farming or not . &quot; in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over the seed , the most recent examples are the mer@@ gers of Chem@@ China and Syn@@ gent@@ a and Bayer . &quot; who wants to buy good , locally and sustain@@ ably produced vegetables , should also know that the way this vegetables is bred is threatened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; food sovereignty without food sovereignty is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to making their seeds available to others . their approach is , in contrast , to patent seed and plant characteristics .
photo of Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk , as the available gene pool is constantly shr@@ inking due to the ever increasing intellectual property rights on plant material , which is therefore increasingly restricted .
Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director O@@ ss@@ i , employed in her PhD thesis with a genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found out that about a third of all the anti@@ trust features are protected as intellectual property , making it suitable for plant breeders either at all or only difficult .
there are still no such estimates for other plants , but experts like Lu@@ by suggest that massive grown plants such as wheat are patented in even greater style than let@@ tu@@ ce or car@@ rots .
a question of view
plants are grown in such a way that they have specifically desired characteristics - from those by which their taste or colour improves to those , due to which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of pat@@ enting on plant properties suggest that the available plant material for breeders is taking more and more patents . genetic diversity is far more difficult than ever before , because changing conditions due to climate change are far worse predictable .
in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to spokesperson C@@ arly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to acknow@@ le@@ dges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the United States Department of Agriculture , the company is committed to maintaining genetic diversity .
it contradic@@ ts the notion that intellectual property inst@@ alls other breeders , as &quot; patents and the protection of plant vari@@ et@@ ties promote innovation . &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent has expi@@ red .
often these instructions help others to get to the same result with another method .
such protection does not in@@ hibit innovations , but encourages them by making more material and know @-@ how available to the public . &quot;
Mort@@ on looks the other way : waiting for 20 years until a patent exp@@ ires , certainly does not promote innovation .
and if you have to wait so long to grow crops , which are adapted to the changed environmental conditions , you would have already lost the battle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Mort@@ on &apos;s main argument is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should continue to stay : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; independent plant breeders do not have time or money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want farmers to make their work easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us and it becomes impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and newest genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; overall , Mort@@ on interfer@@ es with the concept of pat@@ enting plant @-@ characteristics : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not really create the characteristics themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plants form them themselves and as breeders we finally have no idea how the plants do that .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for Caro@@ l Dep@@ pe , plant breeding bree@@ der in the US state O@@ reg@@ on and O@@ ss@@ i @-@ Member of the Management Board , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; who breeds one type , also breeds its own values in it .
anyone who believes in industrial agriculture with large farms and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures , for whose cultivation is required mass her@@ b@@ ici@@ des , breeds this concept of agriculture in its varieties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is perfectly contrary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such that are moving on international markets but are smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to ) , they manage most small seed companies to survive even without patents - either they reject the patent or they think it is too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case .
the independent plant breeding company Frank Mort@@ on looks for Sal@@ ate in his breeding garden .
photo by Karen Mort@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; apart from that , Mort@@ on believes that breeders by avoiding plant patents would be more innovative : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it looks like I am working with my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies that patent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I need new material for my catalogue , because I know that my competitors will sell my grades for a few years , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent you are protected from competition for 20 years , which makes it quite easy for me . &quot;
although the US seems to be a leader in the &quot; open source &quot; breeding , the concept is spreading rapidly all over the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , introduces a &quot; open source &quot; seed program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it also supports them to come to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seeds and sell their own . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German organization Agre@@ col is working on an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; license which ultimately forms a formal and legally binding form of the O@@ ss@@ i obligation for breeders in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( rules for breeders differ from country to country , therefore the O@@ ss@@ i obligation cannot be easily adopted one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able , thus addressing the current practice of the European Patent Office that allows patents on conven@@ tionally bred plants .
however , an explanation is not yet a law ; now it is to the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office into implementing this new line .
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa came together to learn something about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards pat@@ enting seed .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; program for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems , explains that the organization is currently building a global alliance for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems for which the official starting signal should be scheduled next year .
an association of environmental and development groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development aid organization US@@ C Canada and the Action Group on erosion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database of seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , has published a report . it believes that farmers have the opportunity to come to seed , change it and improve seed policy in order to ensure a stable supply of food .
the report also highlights the importance of a diverse local supply of seed for sustainable food systems - a context that Lu@@ by of O@@ ss@@ i hopes to see more people soon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has focused above all on where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role in this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now trying to make people realize that there is still more behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest aims of cens@@ orship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities still jail content on the internet .
this time , it was the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekend around the 5th of August , the Egyptian government closed the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) which documents human rights ab@@ uses in Egypt and the Arab world and reports on the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in August , the network published an opinion on Facebook , in which it critic@@ ised the Egyptian authorities for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains true to its objective , to defend the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world , to def@@ use the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world , so it has never been as important as it is now .
AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organization in Egypt , after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , as for example the independent news site M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arab @-@ speaking issue of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Qatar derived network of Al J@@ az@@ e@@ era due to alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of wave of website barriers to victims . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the main sources of human rights in Arabic language ht@@ t@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
besides AN@@ HR@@ I , the blog of colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher Ah@@ med Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada has no access to Egypt anymore .
Zi@@ ada used his blog for spreading columns and articles that he writes for in Egypt non @-@ accessible websites and media .
now the blog he set up to circum@@ vent the cens@@ orship of the Egyptian government , even the goal of an attack .
blo@@ ggers , the provider in which also adas blog is home , however , is further accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , reporting on the student protests and taking a video as police practi@@ sed physical violence against two students .
his articles mainly revol@@ ve around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada commented on the government &apos;s blocking and reflected what it means for him :
blocking blogs is very old but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ Fat@@ tah al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even if the blocking of blogs may not be significant for the world , it is for two reasons for me :
1 ) They managed to convey to me the feeling of a state of siege ; an arrest , attempted murder , sum@@ mons to the National Security Council , blocking blogs and any other website for which I was working .
2 ) They proved that I did not write in vain . in other words , my words have an influence , even if only a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first I used it to post items to b@@ ypass the cens@@ orship .
but now , after they have locked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the brave leave the way to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Ex@@ pression ( af@@ te ) Egyptian authorities closed off from May 24th to June 6th , 133 web pages . this resulted in technical tests in networks of different Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , V@@ od@@ af@@ one and E@@ ti@@ sal@@ at .
af@@ te also documented the block@@ age of vendors , which was possible by embra@@ cing internet cens@@ orship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
af@@ te reported in her research :
on Monday , June 12th we noticed how the blocking of web pages that V@@ P@@ N@@ s offer began .
such a practice points to the government &apos;s intention to continue to block and filter content that Egyptian users could have access .
the situation is also wor@@ sen@@ ed by the fact that the cens@@ orship decisions are taken behind closed doors , which means that the Egyptian population has no legal basis , with which it can proceed against these acts in court .
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with cens@@ orship and who will it attack next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in the war ?
the inhabitants argue .
the Brazilian army was engaged in the fav@@ el@@ as in Nit@@ er@@ Ã³@@ i , a city in Rio de Janeiro , during the government crisis .

day after day newspapers in whole Brazil report with glo@@ omy head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motives .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot in school &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A police officer in Rio de Janeiro &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Thi@@ eves rob@@ bed pharmac@@ ies with military weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Tim@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , nav@@ y and air tea to Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the wave of violence in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years in Rio .
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organization Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become everyday and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; find at least the managers of a local newspaper .
on 16 August , the editorial &quot; Extra &quot; published for the detailed reporting on violence in Rio published the editorial &quot; This is not normal &quot; in which it announced a new section called &quot; War in Rio . &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now published there .
the motives for her decision explained the newspaper so :
extra will continue to report about crimes that happen in every major city in the world like murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual crimes , etc . all that is devi@@ ating from the civili@@ zed standard and what happens only in Rio will be published in the section &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : it is not normal !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the only alternative that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a four minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ Ã¡@@ vio Gu@@ edes , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper , declared that this decision was not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure .
it is probably the only newspaper worldwide with a war @-@ martial in a country that does not recognize the war at all .
in the same video , a journalist explains that according to the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 8@@ 43 territories that are controlled by criminal organisations .
in the editorial , the newspaper continues :
we are aware that a war discourse , when it is distorted , can also be used to obsc@@ ure the atro@@ cities of the police , who only shoots and then asks questions .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose goal is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the ma@@ fia and its partners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; does the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; harm more than they use ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
in an article on the news portal , The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , journalist Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira is argu@@ ing against calling the violence as a &quot; war . &quot; in their opinion , this is a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to punish those responsible for the police .
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as demonstrated in the analysis of military operations in Rio , in combination with inadequate investments in personnel , education and historical and self @-@ compl@@ acent car@@ elessly .
in memory : the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than its capital .

calling Rio de Janeiro as &quot; the most violent place in Brazil &quot; is wrong according to Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia : &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 in the north and northeast of the country . these are the latest available data .
none of these cities are located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when we look at the mor@@ es per state , Rio is on number 16 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she writes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
extra belongs to the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , which , as Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia stresses , has repeatedly repe@@ aled the state &apos;s security policy for years .
these security policy measures included the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ Ã­@@ cia Paci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit set up by the state of Rio in 2003 , whose aim is to capture fav@@ ela by deplo@@ ying a massive police ban and permanently station@@ ing a unit there .
in the beginning , this actually led to a decrease of violent death cases . but after several years , the U@@ PP has increasingly been under fire after several reports of har@@ ass@@ ment and re@@ pres@@ sions against poor communities , which should actually protect the newly created police unit .
on his Facebook page , journalist Jo@@ Ã£o Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux from one of his articles dating back to 2010 explains why violence in Rio does not comply with the criteria set out by the Geneva Convention on the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also involves serious consequences for the people .
this calls for the state to use means and means typical of war . this includes penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; in which a civilian is a sharp point in the landscape and becomes the object of &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; and &quot; lost balls . &quot;
war back or forth , fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ el@@ as continue to suffer in Rio .
a week ago , the police cleared the mountain with the fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
in the midst of all this violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : a fruit sal@@ es@@ man died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter .

since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer under brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime against loyal troops .
according to victories , Watch , a joint initiative of the Peace Organization , PA@@ X and the Syria Institute Research Institute , there are currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege in Damascus and the Um@@ land , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and Id@@ li@@ b .
the East Gh@@ out@@ a region is particularly affected when an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 called for the lives of hundreds of civilians .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition are going on the basis of investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was perpet@@ rated by the Assad regime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2013 , these rebel @-@ controlled areas have been under siege under siege , which led to residents being exposed to locally produced or smu@@ g@@ gled food through tunnels and control points .
due to the many years of block@@ ade traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population .
as a counter @-@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian workers and academ@@ ics will teach the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , how they can plant their own mushrooms as &quot; food @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da and conduct the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms are not among the common foods planted in Syria and are very rare in the Syrian cuisine . however , their food makes them an attractive source of food for many residents of the besieg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a .
the Direc@@ torate of the Project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , spoke to the French news agency AF@@ P :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we decided to cultivate mushrooms , because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dr. Ah@@ med Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices , who has been fighting for the project for three years , announc@@ ing its relief that it is gaining more and more awareness . &quot;
in order to earn money for the initiative , we use the Human@@ it@@ arian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Th@@ in in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da .
it is planned to teach 125 families to grow mushrooms so Dr. Lei@@ la leads to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the constitution of this article , they have reached more than 100 % of their expected target of around 12,@@ 700 â¬ , but will continue to raise funds to Can@@ Th@@ under until Monday , the 0@@ 4th of September 2017 .
the initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity at 80 % .
due to the shortage of fuel , locally produced fuel is made of plastic to supply the generators with the necessary energy .
Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices , that they began with the &quot; production of mushrooms from the regions &quot; before veri@@ fying their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption .
then they planted a small mushroom grav@@ eyard in a tub . when this succeeded , they used a larger bathtub . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; educational farm for the region &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed mushrooms all over East Gh@@ out@@ a for free .
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people mushroom cultivation for various reasons : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; break the siege &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
providing a new food source in the market .
spread a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food residue ( such as paper , tea , coffee kit , cardboard , etc . ) for the production of new foods .
creating new jobs , especially for women working at home .
creating new jobs for people with disabilities , who are tied to their homes .
he said : &quot; we hope to spread this idea all over the world , so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and the siege will become visible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experiences to inspire people in crisis areas and we can help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese call for justice for the victims of 2017
several hundred people prot@@ ested on 21 October in many district capitals in Portugal , demanding justice for the victims of fires that were r@@ amp@@ aging in the north of Portugal in the week before .
forty @-@ two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the government calling for a state shower last week from solidarity with the victims for three days .
fires were also registered in the Gal@@ icia region in Spain , where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 refrac@@ tory out@@ breaks that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , a similar tragedy occurred in Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured by the fires .
according to the European forest surveillance system , which monitors forest areas via satellite images , around 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district .
so that you can get a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is only in 4 districts no fire .

numerous videos are spread in the network and show images that allow better insights into what is happening :
the fores@@ eeable tragedy
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the goal of the Saturday protests was the demand for better prevention and fire @-@ fighting measures by the state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people wondered why the civil protection was unable to contain the scale of the tragedy as far as possible .
Jo@@ Ã£o Sover@@ al from the Federation of Far@@ mers of Portugal declared the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
after Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o the streets and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did not do this anywhere : there are dozens of reports of open roads closed by fire .
in the woods of Lei@@ ria there could have been a similar tragedy like in June , as the streets were closed very late . &quot;
in addition , building permits are questioned in places with a high fire risk .
a wide @-@ ranging reform of the reform of the forest , which the government had brought in after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was rejected by the municipalities , who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law which allowed the construction activity from case to case if the applicant had funds for self @-@ defence - that was an open back@@ door , so that everything could be built , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jo@@ Ã£o Sor@@ val writes in the same article of the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees made of easily inflamm@@ able wood , as in a vi@@ cious circle , spread to the fires of this species .
in addition to these problems , the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal on 15 and 16 October , when residents searched for information or tried to contact relatives , was offline .
it was a private initiative that supplied the population with information : it used the proprietary Ci@@ vili@@ zation Data using the application f@@ og@@ os.@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ Ã£o P@@ ina in order to simplify the work of the fire bri@@ g@@ ade and was so crucial that the servers did not withstand the ons@@ lau@@ ght of 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires : the website counted more than half a million access .
even the founder asked for help :

in one night in the autumn of 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban .
two years earlier , a terrible civil war broke out between the various mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n groups that had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . so Afghanistan became a land of terror and despair .
exactly at that time , A@@ shar@@ a Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , joined the ethnic group of the Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in Central Afghanistan for the last time together with his family at dinner .
even though his mother didn &apos;t say that at that time , she knew she would no longer see her son again - maybe never again .
in the morning , the boy should break open .
his unc@@ le would pick him up and bring him to the tu@@ gs .

Ab@@ du@@ l Ali Maz@@ ari , leader of the He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat party dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt def@@ en@@ cel@@ ess .
the Taliban , known for their hatred for the Haz@@ ara , came closer and closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ a found himself in Pakistan .
for a few years he worked in a coal mine . the work was heavy and made him sick .
once again , he found himself in a foreign country along with other refugees and s@@ lugg@@ ish sacks with mortar that were heavier than himself , in order to earn his livel@@ ihood .
back then , like today , the life of Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran was marked by misery and exploitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was really hard , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ members in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site on which we also worked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were no services and no heating there . we hung nylon in front of the open windows so that we were not freezing at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ a left his life without papers in Iran and made herself ready for the journey to Europe .
during the dangerous passage on the sea he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and str@@ anded on a small un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum request , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 .
for some time , A@@ shar@@ af was homeless , running alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks , and went to a church that distributed food to needy people twice a day .
it is true that Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seek@@ ers due to relatively high initial ratings . it is true , however , that the conditions that asylum seek@@ ers find in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic .
the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes that &quot; the system &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the vast majority of asylum seek@@ ers are housed in the more than 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special reception centres . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are impro@@ vised structures in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ qualified personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be allocated to a reception centre , if they officially filed an application for asylum - which may go for months after the application of the asylum application .
until then , people who have no money for accommodation can either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
thus did A@@ shar@@ af also .
but his irre@@ pres@@ sible livel@@ ihood helped A@@ shar@@ pen to get rid of these conditions soon .
after he had made various works in the construction industry for several years , A@@ shar@@ k put his entire savings into the founding of a hostel in Venice .
this went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a quick snack .
A@@ shar@@ a Bar@@ atis success story is now subject of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venice luxury - an Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) by director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
the film won the Venice City Award for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles .
according to in@@ official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries .
in recent years , some of the companies operated by Afgh@@ ans have emerged , including tail@@ ors , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience , where the wa@@ iters and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant relates the history of their journey to Italy through the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes .
Afgh@@ an entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizz@@ eria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a sus@@ hi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
however , A@@ shar@@ af@@ s &apos;s goals range far beyond the Italian hospitality industry and retail and aim back to the country which he had forced to leave as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where there is a risk , there are possibilities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily if I know my people suffer .
I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women .
they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as everyone else . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af also makes plans for opening a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and preservation techniques . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they can sell their crop surplus on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the development of the successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end , stability and prosperity are .
A@@ shar@@ pen made this journey himself . now he would like to help other Afgh@@ ans along the way .
citizen report : bill dra@@ fts from Egypt enable redund@@ ancy of social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for more than 900 days in prison .
he reported on the clearance of the camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , which prot@@ ested against the overthrow of President Mohamed Mor@@ si .

the Egyptian parliament has reviewed a draft bill that fores@@ ees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registering with a government authority .
users would have to register to use social networks within six months of receiving their full name as well as their ID number .
those who miss this step could be sentenced to six months &apos; imprisonment or the ex@@ tri@@ bution of a penalty .
the law , which was promoted by sixty members of parliament , is currently ahead of the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be deb@@ ated there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another MP filed a legislative proposal in May which would introduce tough@@ er pen@@ alties for the ins@@ ult of president or high officials . &quot; &quot; &quot;
under the law of Egypt , the insul@@ ting of the president and state institutions is already pun@@ ish@@ able . under the legislative proposal , such a crime would , however , be punished with prison and fin@@ es , as legal experts of Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy .
if the law is passed , this may mean up to three years imprisonment for the convic@@ ted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger for many years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he took photos of violence against demonstr@@ ators who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the removal of the elected President Mohammed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan was waiting , more than 700 protest participants who had been arrested during the same incident , four years in jail for a trial date .
recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed to 20 May , because according to human rights groups , the prison management failed to bring the accused from prison to the cour@@ t@@ room .
Sha@@ w@@ kan is threatening the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree , head@@ ings of inter alia weapons possession , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder .
in another case , a Criminal Court in G@@ iza spoke the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were indic@@ ted for their reporting to the pro @-@ Mor@@ si session block@@ ade on the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo .
the Court also reduced the punishment of journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested during the pre @-@ event , from 25 years to 5 years .
Tunisi@@ an activ@@ ist list@@ ens to scanned documents
in May , Tunisi@@ an authorities spent six hours inter@@ rog@@ ating Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , who is co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy Project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia was mainly inter@@ rog@@ ated with an action plan . said Plan stems from the President of the Republic , who , according to the plan , expressly assists a controversial draft bill that would guarantee business@@ men and former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption , provided they return all illeg@@ ally received funds .
the document published on April 21 on the Na@@ wa@@ at website sheds light on how the pres@@ si@@ dian plans for support of the legislation look like .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia refused to mention his sources stating Article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an Press Committee stating that journalists are entitled to protect their sources .
nevertheless , he appeared as a witness in the Tunis District Court on 9 May .
does China want to force the users of social media to present their identification ?
according to new regulations by the State Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media require permission before writing or sharing messages in social media .
in addition , in the regulations it is stated that registration with full real name will be required .
analysts believe that the elimination of anonymous comments in conversations within social networks is to be achieved . it is up to now unclear how the authorities will apply these rules .
Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to assert these rules only sel@@ ectively in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and independence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then do we see ourselves in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
not in Russia !
the cens@@ orship of Russia blocked the access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat sent to register as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Organis@@ ator of Information Diff@@ usion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this designation is part of a 2014 law , thanks to which the Russian government holds a list of online services that organize the &quot; publication of the information . &quot; the law also allows the government to make said services for removing content and to force it upon request for the delivery of user data .
these websites are currently Websites such as V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ clas@@ n@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the email service mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services .
Turkish court decre@@ es ban Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
a Turkish court decre@@ ed the Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , since Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English @-@ language articles , the information that Turkey supports the jihadi@@ sts in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , maritime affairs and communication provided that the site was blocked because it is an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; source of information that co@@ operates with groups in order to promote a political diffusion campaign against Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first time Turkey has completely blocked the website . it is , among other things , China , one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible .
Britain cannot stop puff@@ ing up
after this week , the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation on increased surveillance powers that would force Internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and install Backdoor programs that dec@@ r@@ yp@@ t data encryption .
the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and intelligence services regarding the proposal , but has provided other technology companies and civilian populations abroad .
despite all this , the consultation continues until May 19 . reactions and proposals by members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior .
