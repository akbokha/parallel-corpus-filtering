<seg id="1">Although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation I grew up with American movies, have danced to American music, read American writers and practised his sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had such profound effect on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film.</seg>
<seg id="6">When he was 14 years old, I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican Letter, a fearless reporter, who, with the help of Julia Roberts, uncovered the murderous conspiracy of an oil magnate who wanted to occupy the supreme federal court with judges who were interested in his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "free after Method Man," "" "I was as if that is the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona I only strengthened my admiration for the USA.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said, "America is the only country in which I've ever lived, whose diversity is so welcoming that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I had even written a very blackish love letter about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much was written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most unusual aspect of his ascension is for me how he deals with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">With his opinion, he never stops behind the mountain as you say so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thinks, as a former colleague puts it, and publicly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, African-American and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, people responded to his statements and voted for him in droves.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won in the Republican primaries was the highest number that a candidate nominated by the party ever reached.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigotest person, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I couldn't reconcile Trump and his voters with the people I got to know during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">Like my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program, which takes people from all over the world, a deeply believing person with whom I could talk about Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "also Trumps Weltanschauung didn't agree with the current editor of the" "" "Cincinnati Inquirer" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our shared love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the "Phoenix Suns" in the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps Intolerance stands in stark contrast to the generosity that I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who fights for the environment for her lifetime, and to her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">She is still adapting to the commitment of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew Deley, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors whose wise counsel helped me a lot in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values embodied by them deepened my love toward America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump cleared his way to nominee Republican presidential candidates, they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">But it turned out that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On November 8, 2016 more than 50 million Americans, mostly White, gave the presidency to a man, despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt against non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The confrontation with the idea that people voted for Trump because they either shared his racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook those things, nearly broke my heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call the Trump voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">To categorize people, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and disrespectful, and implies an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters, most of whom know, voted for Trump because they want to regain control of a country that disappointed them?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they might say that they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who commits the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contempt on those looking different from him.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "this" "" "white-ash" "" "(note of the White against all other ethnicities," "" "According to white vs. whiplash, which means" "" "trauma" "" "), as the great Van Jones termed, has killed exactly that which America has made so great." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality, it is nonetheless a powerful idea - whatever faith or background one may have, America welcomes everyone.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country elected as its president, twice the son of a Kenyan, whose history, as he says himself, would nowhere be possible anywhere else in the world.</seg>
<seg id="44">However, with the election Donald Trumps, a vast majority of the white Americas made this promise and says: to hell with diversity, freedom of religion and the whole concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11, the white man is back at the helm, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">In all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a manifestation for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, have a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "the crowd responded with a loud" "" "no!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "no!" "" "the crowd roared." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">"" "" "" "do Latinos have a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they answered." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they cried, and their voices became louder." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "would anyone not be like you, a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">"" "he received a unanimous and loud" "" "NO" "" "!" ""</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan included in the words: "thank God, Mr. Trump, it's not your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The land for which his son fell, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is Trumps Land now, said the news.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan, could not find a place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="67">The "Recycled Instruments" by Cateura, Paraguay, during a Washington DC concert.</seg>

<seg id="69">What does the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero Community in Oaxaca have shared with the children of the Paraguaan city of Cateuru?</seg>
<seg id="70">The music played at both places not only changed children's lives, but also a very close link...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the apostasy</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump, just 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial town that is popular among the tourists -but worlds apart from the nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world-famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For some years now, La banda de MÃºsica (Musikbande) plays in the community: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which has found a way to overcome the surrounding poverty with their musical instruments.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become the central interest for the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The British newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The community, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its drug abuse and the gangs "violence.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered a rare glimmer of hope for the youth.</seg>
<seg id="78">Young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, writes the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come out of school they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">You always come laughing and with shiny eyes and play in the whirl you learn day by day, trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timpani, bongos and the conga to play.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from garbage</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero, the children of Cateura - a village located practically on the top of the largest garbage dump of AsunciÃ³n in Paraguay - on instruments made of recycled waste materials:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with reprocessed instruments made of local solid waste materials manufactured in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateuru, where the recyclers under the leadership of Favio ChÃ¡vez have begun turning parts of the waste into instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imitate violins, violas, cellos, double basses, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion, all of which were produced from the trash.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article from the Los Angeles Times, Favio ChÃ¡vez, a local ecologist and musician of the children of Cateuru, remembers the early days:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no room to rehearse and we had to teach at the same place where parents worked in the garbage. children didn't know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them didn't live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed as Favio something that he had never seen before: a violin made of rubbish.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today, there is a whole orchestra playing instruments made of reprocessed material and which is called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentation called "Landfill Harmonic" (harmonic landfill) records the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world produces about one billion tons of waste every year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and him are the poorest - like the people in Cateuru, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn him into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Fill Harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspiring spectacle of trash-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra even played his music before Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and teamwork can combat IUU fishing successfully</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo Â© FISH-i Africa - a project that combats wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports on international, practical solutions to environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">Re-publication takes place as part of an agreement with Global Voices for the joint use of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, it was known at that time that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liberia, before it visited the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were accordingly upset and little inclined to welcome a criminal of this kind at their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comorors, Mozambique and the Seychelles were rapidly mobilizing against the ship. they refused to refute one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing permit.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "" "" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused everything," "" "Benedict Kiilu, a senior veteran of the Kenyan Fisheries Authority." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013 the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: it was not able to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">Finally, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, because of the looting of the country's fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative that crosses criminal practices and protects resources was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, launched in 2012 by NGO stop Illegal fishing (stop illegal fishing).</seg>
<seg id="107">In addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the members of this network are the six countries that were expelled from their waters at that time.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "we have eight countries that are like-minded and work together. they exchange information and help each other, where it comes to illegal fishing," "" "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trust Project, Ending Illegal Fishing. this project offers FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, therefore it is extremely difficult to track down. therefore, illegal fishing is a main cause of overfishing by regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">The deliberate disregard of existing laws, through which certain habitats and species are to be protected, can damage illegal fishing ecosystems that have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing were once impeded by bureaucratic obstacles and also by the snail pace, with the information between individual countries, the actions happen today in real time, with trackbar at FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">For example, the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses, news about suspicious activities or details that were noticed or experienced during a harbour inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i also draws attention to the activities of ships when they move on the open sea via satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows the authorities to identify ships that fish in forbidden areas. also, suspicious road routes can be discovered, such as those suggesting that a ship loads his captured fish on the way to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such investigations can show whether the involved ships have a catch license where they were on the go and possibly if they have a criminal detachment.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries opposing illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such vessels in their ports, which means that ships cannot sell their cargo, and that they can even be forced to pay for punishments, as in the case of the prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "it is then about considerable financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">And that's what we want to achieve, "says Per Erik Bergh, director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consultancy firm engaged in the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front line</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform was created to recover an estimated 20 million dollars of lost revenue, which the eight members of the HISH-i network lose each year due to the illegal fishermen who invade East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries in which the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world. among these are illegal fishing nets.</seg>
<seg id="122">Their practices include, among other things, activities such as sailing under false flag, fake license papers, phantasia seeds, fish protected species and fishing in conservation areas.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they deliberately utilise the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of a non-gunting organized control system," "" "says Long." "" "in the past, a ship could go fishing illegally and a country could say" "" "You're not running my port." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "but another country could say" "" "Come to Me." "" "and this legal loophole is now trying to close FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="125">Until now the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 investigations of suspicious ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It discovered criminal networks that had distributed fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and it has persecuted and found escaping ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to its cooperation with INTERPOL, the international agency for combating crime, FISH-i can share and maintain information about illegal fishing over long distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "" "" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organized crime," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that should help FISH-i to pinpoint suspicious ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly being developed, also helps to detect the illegal ships that like to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "illegal fishers use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and position." "" "says Duncan Copeland, chief analyst at Trygg Mat tracking, an NGO which also deals with fishery data and provides technical support to FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships, for example, switch off their automatic identification systems, so they can no longer be ordered by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland therefore helps build a system that connects different levels of information. it is intended to help FISH-i to find criminal operating vessels with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team of African nations actually influence the unquestionably global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SunTruth, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Marine Protective Organization Oceana: a platform that provides satellite data and displays the position of each tracking ship worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "together with the neighbours to get a better picture of who is doing - it simply makes sense," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and to bundle their resources for investigation." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this on a global level." "" "the Pew Charitable Trust has a similar project where a global system allows the persecution of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities not only detect criminals, but also scare them off.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that had previously been fishing without a license and had hardly any consequences, know now that they are being watched.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries involved in FISH-i meanwhile have a 33% increase in fishing sales, since fishing boats have been purchasing more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia had helped to detect Greko 1, the inspectors on board found tow nets where they were banned.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "other countries also notice these successes." "" "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "" "Kiilu says." "" "we have become an object of study." ""</seg>
<seg id="148">In 2015, six countries have joined forces, the so-called West Africa Task Force. they are also combating illegal fishing, according to exactly the same model as FISH-i. "Safety is the goal of creating even more of such initiatives and structures in other regions," says Copeland.</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's youngest member state Somalia was able to announce its first major triumph: in October, it presented Greko 1, a ship that was under false flag. and not only was the ship travelling without a license and were used towing nets, which are now banned.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the ship was also invaded into forbidden water reservoirs that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "" "taking measures against Greko 1 set a strong sign that they are against illegal fishing," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time the evidence that such a special, collaborative approach to protecting the oceans is actually working in the entire world ocean. Emma Bryce is a freelance journalist and lives in London.</seg>

<seg id="153">The road movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They are considered a protest against the government's decision to stop the referendum on the removal of President NicolÃ¡s Maduro.</seg>
<seg id="155">This image of MarÃ­a Alejandra Mora shows a close-up of the demonstration in Maracaibo in 2014.</seg>

<seg id="157">After the government refused the opposition to a referendum on a referendum, the Venezuelans, in whose eyes the negotiations on the country's political and economic crisis, ran into emptiness by gathering in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="158">Under the hashtag # LaTeaDeVenezuela (for example: the order of Venezuela) can be found both pictures of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them.</seg>
<seg id="159">The debate will also be held in other parts of the country, including in the lowland area of Barinas, in the Andean regions MÃ©rida and TÃ¡chira, in the centrally located federal state of Carabobo and on Isla Margarita in the state of Nueva Esparta.</seg>
<seg id="160">The political and economic situation in the country is deteriorating continuously, which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezuelans through an acute shortage of food and medicines.</seg>
<seg id="161">Many of the representatives of the opposition saw in the tenure of the current President NicolÃ¡s Maduro the chance of a fundamental change; in the end, however, the reluctance of a new election was blocked by official authorities.</seg>
<seg id="162">Marianne DÃ­az, contributor to Global Voices in Venezuela, sums up the context of the decision as follows in her latest article:</seg>
<seg id="163">In the context of the social, political and economic crisis, in which inflation and violence are among the highest in the world (the inflation rate is estimated to be 500% at the end of the year) and in which a serious and far-reaching shortage of food and medicine exists, the referendum was considered the only way to give the country the chance to recapture its institutional structures and to establish a new government alliance.</seg>
<seg id="164">The electoral alliance between Mesa de la Unidad DemocrÃ¡tica or short MUD (roughly: round table of the Democratic unit), in which opposition parties and political groups joined forces, called for a mass rally to support the National Assembly after the 2015 elections, as well as a march to the Miraflores palace, the Venezuelan government office, on November 3, should continue the blocking of the referendum on the removal of the government.</seg>
<seg id="165">The call was commented on Twitter among other things as follows:</seg>
<seg id="166">It is as far as Venezuela: tomorrow National Assembly, Friday civil strife and on November 3rd all to Caracas to the Miraflores palace.</seg>

<seg id="176">On Twitter pictures are heaping about confrontations, as well as reports of oppression and mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="177">Particularly large waves struck the message about police oppression in the centrally located town of Maracay.</seg>
<seg id="178">The demonstrators went back to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves against the police and armed supporters of the government, according to their own statement.</seg>
<seg id="179">Hours later they could leave the cathedral safely, but the protests continued.</seg>
<seg id="180">In other parts of the country, some demonstrators tried to stop police forces, including this woman in the Andean State TÃ¡chira:</seg>
<seg id="181">The women in TÃ¡chira carry no skirts, because otherwise you could see something that many National Guards don't have!</seg>
<seg id="182">Meanwhile, an infographic is already making the round that reflects the extent of repression per day:</seg>
<seg id="183">So the dictatorship has oppressed the country.</seg>
<seg id="184">Many of the representatives of the government questioned the validity of the demand for a ban on tenure - it was now proven in the eyes of many people through the presence of countless people on the streets.</seg>
<seg id="185">Myteks Media Labs added:</seg>
<seg id="186">NicolÃ¡s and Diosdado claim that 1% of the signatures are falsified.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here is your resignation!</seg>
<seg id="188">On the street!</seg>
<seg id="189">Others analyse these protests as a further step in the fight against a government that has made little effort against the devastating economic crisis, rather than letting go of critical voices:</seg>
<seg id="190">They took us so much - but also fear!</seg>
<seg id="191">Marches are increasing in frequency and intensity.</seg>
<seg id="192">Some Venezuelans reported the media that they were too hungry to participate in a strike rather than to work or go shopping.</seg>

<seg id="197">This is an adapted version of an interview given by Alejo GÃ³mez with Luis Quijano, which was published on 23 August 2016 in DÃ­a a DÃ­a, an Argentine news site.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to take a look at the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentinean city of CÃ³rdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">As a grown-up man, Quijano now testified in the great La Perla-Ribera trial in the province of CÃ³rdoba, against his father.</seg>
<seg id="201">In the trial, which ended on 24 August 2016, crimes committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship were investigated.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano did not choose his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations at La Perla prison, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years, he kept the secret of family secrets.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time, I thought that was fine.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child of 15 years you do not notice that you are manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">At that time I could not realize that my father was a thief, torturers and murderers.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis did not have a choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was a gendarmerie. during the Argentinian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a time of state terrorism, his father was deputy commander of the intelligence department 141 in La Perla prison.</seg>
<seg id="210">Luis Alberto Quijano.</seg>

<seg id="212">But this is not the story of Luis Quijano, the oppressor who is accused of abduction in 158 cases, torture, murder in almost 100 cases and kidnapping of a 10-year-old child.</seg>
<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quijanos's son, a man who, over the years, realized the extent of the atrocities he had witnessed as a boy and who testified before a Federal Court against his own father.</seg>

<seg id="216">When my father started taking me to the military base, I often went to the sports hall with us. there I was friends with a boy who made martial arts.</seg>
<seg id="217">They all called him "Kent."</seg>
<seg id="218">I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and asked me to identify my friend on it.</seg>
<seg id="219">He said:</seg>
<seg id="220">You are an asshole, you have friends with one of the ERP.</seg>
<seg id="221">Make sure you don't have to kidnap you one day and then I'll have to save you.</seg>
<seg id="222">The abbreviation ERP is for EjÃ©rcito revolutionucionario del Pueblo, a revolutionary People's Army - the military arm of the revolutionary workers "party of Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="223">That is why he forbade me to go to the gym again. a few days later, he took me to work on the military base.</seg>
<seg id="224">He told me I would become a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be ok, because my father had educated me.</seg>
<seg id="226">At the military base, I had to destroy papers that had belonged to the prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="227">These were all possible documents: university degrees, handwritten notes, literature, certificates, propaganda material, books, simply everything.</seg>

<seg id="230">My father took me four times to La Perla - all in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">During the first and last time he left me at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">When he took me the second time, he ordered me to get off. he led me to a barrack, in the cars, furniture, TV, fridges - everything possible - stood.</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">He gave me a small packet wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a big lump of silver in it.</seg>
<seg id="235">On that day I went to the other end of the barracks, where the stolen items were turned off and kept me with a guard.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">The prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">I went in and saw a couch that men were tortured.</seg>
<seg id="239">She looked like a field bed and metal springs.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found out that they fastened it to the end of a cable. the other end was fastened to the body of the person that was tied there.</seg>

<seg id="348">On one shield, the Japanese word was the "older car driver," falsely - perhaps but also with bad rear-thoughts & # 8212; translated as "fearsome motorists."</seg>
<seg id="349">The wrong translation was to be read on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself from September 1 to 20.</seg>
<seg id="350">Processing of the original photo by Joshua Levine, which has been widely shared in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The mistake occurred to the translator Julian Holmes, a resident Kyotos. he was also the one who drew attention to the local newspapers.</seg>

<seg id="357">The Kyoto prefecture continued to apologize for the translation errors. furthermore, it explained that the error was already contained in the text they received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for correctness before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger told us about the apology:</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">To translate, you need two important skills: passive language skills to understand the source text and use active language skills to translate it into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. generally speaking, the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the pronunciation of native speakers.</seg>
<seg id="379">For example, a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from the French into English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies employ no staff with English as their native language, which could be translated into English. this may be due to lack of understanding of translation, cost reasons or the relatively small number of English native speakers who learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies that do not have foreign employees can nevertheless produce translations within the company. then the Japanese employee, whose English knowledge is considered the best, is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The verbatim and enigmatic sentences, which are produced by machine translation, show that this technique can't replace a human translator for a long time. this is particularly true for some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangest English formulations in Japan, including the puzzling imprints, which often decorate t-shirts or bags, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable as jewelry or at least harmless. however, from large companies or governments that have the means to guarantee higher standards, more careful translations can be expected.</seg>
<seg id="389">In the future, the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a serious source for its translations.</seg>

<seg id="392">On Friday morning, 7 April, Venezuelan Internet users reported that they had no access to the online channel Vivoplay.</seg>
<seg id="393">Later, other users wrote that the internet appearances of VPITV and El Capitolio TV were no longer accessible.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online channels also overtook photos of the protests in Caracas, organized by opposition groups, resisting the government of NicolÃ¡s Maduros.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests started in early April after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the role of parliament to the executive and the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos DÃ­az, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a traceroutes. he pointed out that the link was known and recommended the users to use VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the Internet.</seg>

<seg id="398">It seems that web pages of Venezuelan providers are once again blocked.</seg>
<seg id="399">This is from the page of @ VivoPlayNet.</seg>
<seg id="400">Offers such as Vivoplay are popular with Venezuelans with Internet access, especially in times of unrest.</seg>
<seg id="401">Traditional media have been reluctant to report protests since 2014. at that time, the Commission for Telecommunications threatened them with fines and closures if they continued to report on the demonstrations, as the Commission saw this as a "call to violence."</seg>
<seg id="402">Without cable TV and informative national TV channels, I registered again at @ vivoplaynet.</seg>
<seg id="403">It is amazing that it is still cheaper than buying two liters of lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO VEsinIF later confirmed that not only Vivoplay is inaccessible by blocking the Domain Name System (DNS), but also two other online channels. this also applies to the Internet site at which the National Assembly transfers its sessions.</seg>
<seg id="405">Earlier research by the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had revealed that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS. this is a technique whereby the DNS server requests to answer questions of certain domains correctly.</seg>
<seg id="406">If a web site is blocked by the DNS, the server responds defective or refuses to request a query on such a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNA lock: @ elcapitoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">At VPITV, a third locked channel, the broadcast was set on Thursday, 6 April, when the VPITV cameraman Elvis Flores, who transferred the protests in Caracas live, was taken into custody.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was beaten while he was in police custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">Eight hours later he was released, and VPITV went on stream again.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, the government has also reported that the government regulates the Internet connections, making it increasingly difficult for Venezuelans to gain access to multimedia coverage of the current events in the country.</seg>

<seg id="416">The following article is the abbreviated version of a report by Structural, which is published by Global Voices with kind permission of the authors.</seg>
<seg id="417">The article is part of a series entitled "Vacas que vuelan, Escuelas que Caen," which is edited and republished by Global Voices in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family living there.</seg>
<seg id="419">Shortly before graduating from the university she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride about her. "she is like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "the one who has become something," "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she became ten years old she began to work as a crimta for the family. in Paraguay she describes more than 46,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school.</seg>
<seg id="423">The business is quite simple: a large family with little money overpasses their underage son or their underage daughter to another, richer family. in exchange, the child receives food, training and a roof above the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">What is not mentioned, however, is that the children have to do countless days of housework that can never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all this within the framework of a treaty you cannot lift.</seg>
<seg id="425">The practice described as Criadazgo is widespread in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After graduating, Alvarenga worked for a few years for an organization fighting for the rights of boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke with crimta - especially young girls affected by the practice of the Criadazgo - collected testimonies, researched and denounced.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to call things by name, because the feeling of thankfulness that is inoculated by the crimta is generally guaranteed to remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double deception," explains Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="430">On the one hand, the family who is their daughter in the belief that she can complete her training, improve her position in society and "make something out" can be transferred to another family.</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family who takes the girl with him and justifies its exploitation with the belief that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and might even be starved.</seg>
<seg id="432">Victims of the Criadazgo</seg>
<seg id="433">When the girl is mistreated, his family will only learn about it many years later.</seg>
<seg id="434">Sometimes they never experience it.</seg>
<seg id="435">In January 2016, the so far unknown phenomenon, which takes place in secret in paraguayischen households, got a face.</seg>
<seg id="436">When Carolina MarÃ­n arrived in CaaguazÃº, her body showed signs of violent blows. shortly thereafter she died.</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">She was Criadita in the home of the ex-military TomÃ¡s Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as civil servant at the Einwohnermeldeamt.</seg>
<seg id="439">MarÃ­n lived with them in her house in VaquerÃ­a, a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometres east of the capital AsunciÃ³n.</seg>
<seg id="440">At the end of January 2016 Ferreira stayed with a stick on MarÃ­n until she suffered fatal injury.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">A few days later the media reported about the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was a crimta.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organisations such as UNICEF or Callescuela made the deep-rooted practice of Criadazgo responsible for the death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="445">They called the Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people came together to protest demonstrations demanding that there could be "no more Carolina" in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The girl's name and photos were widespread in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"in Paraguay there are more cows registered than children," Tina Alvarenga complained.</seg>
<seg id="449">Without papers, it is much easier to violate the rights of children.</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbours of the married couple and almost 60 civil society organisations called for speedy investigation of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want TomÃ¡s Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Criminta.</seg>
<seg id="453">If the case comes before court, the case of Carolina MarÃ­n may be pointing the way - for the first time in the history of Paraguays a case of Criadazgo comes before judgment.</seg>
<seg id="454">The everyday life of a crimta</seg>
<seg id="455">The Crimintas are not only exploited as workers; they also live isolated from other girls at their age.</seg>
<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Farmers, in which her father was working, had to sign up bankruptcy and her father lost his work.</seg>

<seg id="477">I couldn't invite anyone to my home. I didn't have a circle of friends at school or in the neighborhood.</seg>

<seg id="502">Sixty Egyptian parliamentarians have recently approved a draft law on "regulating the use and use of social networks."</seg>
<seg id="503">"" "" "" "when adopted by the Parliament, users of social media in Egypt must register with a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter." ""</seg>
<seg id="504">"" "" "" "on the basis of the law a place would then be set up to allow citizens to use social media." ""</seg>
<seg id="505">Within six months with the adoption of the law, users would have to register on the site of the site with their correct names and identity numbers to use social networks.</seg>
<seg id="506">If it fails to do so, it could bring a penalty of up to six months of imprisonment or a fine of money.</seg>
<seg id="507">The draft bill made up of six paragraphs and curated in local media including Youm 7 and Egypt Independent defines social media as "any application running and being used over the Internet to communicate with others by voice, video content and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law will be enforced when it is adopted, as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities should impose the registration. it is unclear how they should identify those who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure regulation at the level of social media companies.</seg>
<seg id="509">Riyad Abdul Sattar, MP and promoter of the bill, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users received a username and password from the Ministry of Telecommunications "to pass through the firewall that blocks Facebook."</seg>
<seg id="510">This could mean that Egypt plans to build a firewall on a national level around Facebook. because of that it would be necessary for Egyptians and Egyptians to submit information about their identity in order to access the network.</seg>
<seg id="511">But it is not yet known that such plans exist.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts on site are sceptical about the technical feasibility of the proposal.</seg>

<seg id="515">In my opinion, they imagine that as they violently control physical public and private spaces it could also be done online.</seg>
<seg id="516">If I take it seriously, it means that they will establish a powerful surveillance system to filter citizens who request a permit or not. and that means a crazy system to monitor people's activities and also to bring them to a court case.</seg>
<seg id="517">This is by no means realistic, but everything is possible in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="518">"" "" "" "in order to be adopted as a law, the draft must first be discussed with the legislature of the Parliament and the constitutional committees before it goes to the plenary debate." ""</seg>
<seg id="519">Whether its acceptance and enforcement must be successful or not, the draft is in line with a pro-military way of thinking in the Parliament, in whose sense the control is maximized and ensured that no deviating narration is present on the image surface, "says Raoof.</seg>

<seg id="525">High up in the mountains of the Kurdistan region in the north-east of Iraq, the animal rights activist Hana Ahmed Raza and her team of scientists from the non-governmental organization Nature Iraq are working to protect the ghostly Persian leopards.</seg>
<seg id="526">A subspecies of the larger family of leopards, which strikes through Africa and Asia, belong to the Persian leopards (Panthera pardus saxopholor). in total, there are between 800 and 1,000 animals, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature. they are endangered due to poaching, loss and fragmentation of their habitat and since they find less and less prey.</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this particular leopard so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">As Raza tells in the video, "the Persian Leopard is the only remaining predator in the Kurdish ecosystem" and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem will also depend on a big predator.</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see a Persian leopard actually in the wild is low and goes against zero. as the team in the video therefore states that they have a record of a big cat in the camera trap, Raza breaks out in pure joy.</seg>
<seg id="530">As a trained biologist Raza likes to show passionately another side of her country, which consists not only of war and conflict.</seg>
<seg id="531">She has been involved in field studies on wild animals and educational programmes in Nature for six years.</seg>

<seg id="544">In early March 2017, the daily Kahoku Shimpo, responsible for northeastern Japan, documented the progress achieved over the past six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the "triple catastrophe" in March 2011. a huge earthquake, a tsunami and an earthquake in Fukushima caused the catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="545">Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, located in Miyagi Prefecture. the Miyagi Prefecture was a prefecture in Japan's Northeast, which had to experience both the earthquake and tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbouring prefectures Fukushima and Iwate were forced to escape, because the tsunami had entire coastal cities disappear from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">In addition, the prefecture Fukushima experienced a nuclear accident, alone because of this alone 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">From a local point of view, Kahoku Shimpo's special report shows what progress has been achieved six years later in order to rebuild the lives of local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper covers both the statistics of the Japanese rebuilding authority and survey results of those affected.</seg>
<seg id="550">Housing construction in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 percent of the planned surrogate houses (have been met in the prefectures of Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate).</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi recorded the greatest success among the three prefectures, here 80 percent of the planned replacement-houses were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such homes whereas Fukushima is the final highlight.</seg>
<seg id="554">At the same time, six years after the catastrophe, even six years after the catastrophe, the evacuation of accommodation establishments (to be the first to be the first of them) to settle into final replacement houses.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the triple catastrophe, nearly 80 000 people saw themselves forced to live in shelters.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016, 360,000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate still lived in such homes.</seg>
<seg id="557">Nearly 40 percent of the evacuees from Fukushima in 2011 still live in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful. more than 75 percent of the evacuees, who were living in homes after the disaster, were moved to final homes.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate, the figure is 34 percent here.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">As the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has been able to determine, 1074 of 1100 schools affected by misfortune have opened their doors until December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While nearly 100 percent of the fishing harbours in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation, only 30 percent of the fishing harbours have resumed their operation in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the nuclear accident resulted in large-scale suffering in the three prefectures of agrarian land.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas, with only 66 percent of the agricultural land in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed arable land in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is just a consequence of nuclear waste, as only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of land destroyed by Fukushima are located in the "nuclear barrier zone."</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered largely, but Fukushima still lags far away.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist figures in Miyagi and Iwate are again 90 percent on the same level as before the disaster. Fukushima, on the other hand, can only have 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal dwellers, it is more difficult to earn their livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to be able to determine the overall picture, the newspaper has conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacuees. she asked her about the state of rebuilding and how their feeling against the tsunami risk has changed.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction to the article Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to learn more about the tsunami awareness among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey revealed that 83.1 percent of local residents took action to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of those surveyed find that there has still not been enough in disaster prevention.</seg>
<seg id="575">How it stands for those who had to evacuate Fukushima prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In its issue commemorating the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has also focused its attention on the situation of the evacuees from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had to witness not only the massive earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, the prefecture of Fukushima was also witness to the worst, disastrous nuclear accident that Japan had ever suffered.</seg>
<seg id="578">Of 160,000 evacuees from Fukushima, nearly 63 thousand people were transferred to areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016, more than 23,000 people, back to Fukushima, had been engrafted into permanent substitute homes.</seg>
<seg id="580">There are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside of their home prefecture after 2017.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the disaster areas most of the evacuees who are still in Behelfsbelshelters are older than 50 years old. they are well known because efforts to rebuild Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima compete with massive construction projects. these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo by 2020.</seg>

<seg id="626">With the introduction of the law of Ãlvaro Reynoso, almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in all of Cuba included the doors (photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The popular Municipality Gregorio ArleÃ© MaÃ±alich, located in the western Cuban province of Mayanque, is generally known as El Central - on Spanish sugar mill - notwithstanding that there is no significant sugar harvest on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It was two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane factories were paralyzed.</seg>
<seg id="629">After planting the sugar cane industry stood still in the region, and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the rumours of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to reinvent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the job.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others resigned and commute daily to the factories which still ground.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a soldier veteran, who rises every day at 4: 00 am, the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not rob his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region, which are in operation after a long inactive period, because they have been preserved.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene remembers to have heard that in MaÃ±alich the sugar cane factory would be preserved, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry has already resisted plagues, the fall of socialism, low market prices, inefficiency, poor management decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar, less than the amount produced in the 1910.</seg>
<seg id="639">The message would have been a motive for concern for the country a few decades ago, but the bad harvests are no longer a novelty.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry turned off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railway platform of the municipality saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically outdated, and hardly competitive in the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production objective was 4 million tons.</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories that could produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution to unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless, the sugar price rose again about a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the report published in 2016 by the OECD and FAO, the United Nations Agricultural and Food Organization.</seg>
<seg id="650">If present production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the export of raw sugar would generate approximately 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"" "" "" "today's day will certainly go into history," "" "these were the first words of the Cuban President Fidel Castro during his speech on October 21, 2002 at the sugar factory in Lavander." ""</seg>
<seg id="653">From then on, the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years the shutdown of 98 sugar cane factories came into existence, more than 65 million people received their full salaries for further education.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio ArlÃ©e MaÃ±alich on May 14, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto PÃ©rez has worked in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">When Nene, as he is known as a soldier, speaks about the closure of the factory, is the word he repeats most often, "scam."</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all those questioned agree: not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order for the place to be preserved, they formed a full-time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first closing-year, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">These were officially written documents, which were only differentiated with regard to the parts which would be removed, addressed to the addressee and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the Minister could approve any withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on, the responsibility was transposed and the letters were getting more and more frequent.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the shutdown of the factory for two years and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money for the sugar cane factories which were still in operation," he asserts.</seg>

<seg id="690">Recording a song from Home to Me - Grassy Narrows First Nation.</seg>
<seg id="691">Photo taken with permission of N'we Jinan.</seg>
<seg id="692">Youth of the First Nations Communities throughout Canada deal with topics that are important to them. they do this by means of hip-hop, thanks to a series of hiking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan Tour, workshop leaders have been bringing workshops and youth centres directly to schools and youth centres since 2014 in order to teach song writing, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were led by the pedagogue David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked in North Quebec with ten Cree communities and then worked together with the Cree Hip Hop group The NorthStars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop is thereby increasing that the young participants explore topics such as "cultural identity, language, debate, love, self-acceptance" or whatever comes to mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the protagonists.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations Communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organise similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnibago in Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' Yoo in the tribe of the Kitsumkalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called "Highway of Tears," a stretch of street in West kanada, where almost two dozen indigenous young women disappeared or were murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">Most of the cases were not solved.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey the importance of preserving traditional customs and customs despite the influences of globalisation.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the young people did not dominate the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song the Whapagoostui Cree First Nation has recorded, the chorus is sung on Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved were given some help from Gary Jolly by the Northstars Hip Hop group, who gave them a drop in the Eastern James Bay Cree dialect.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebookseite of N'we Jinan the stanza is available in transcript, as well a translation into English translated here into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like nobody ever is interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to continue my days on Earth</seg>
<seg id="707">That is the day when you will take our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because as a youth we have lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe we will rise one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">This is how they can grow and do our youth as well</seg>
<seg id="712">This is how they can do what they intended for the Creator.</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan it is possible to see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show potential customers exactly on the menu, close to the entrance shokuhin sanieru (to be the "dishes of the dishes") are exhibited by every dish served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers will see these plastic dishes and decide whether to enter or continue the restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is an entire industry devoted to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the city district of Kappabashi, there are a large number of these small companies that produce those plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese, these plastic dishes are so common that they don't even notice them anymore. however, a new trend turns them into most eye-catching mobile accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">At Naver Matome the blogger itinii published series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the shokuhin sanrabu.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new handcuffs decorated with plastic dishes, as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods were turned into kitschy collecting objects, as in this case, fridge magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few shootings of fridge magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new Boom of Essentials is becoming more and more complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case a kaise-don (a popular rice bowl with seafood) was transformed into a cell phone stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as a cell phone stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">Also this part we made for the exhibition at the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that keeps your mobile phone holding:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And that is just the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some cell phone booklets and mobile phone designers allow you to create your own artwork. in this case, ikura or Lachsrogen is used, a popular topping served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "there is someone who would say:" "" "wow, cool, now I can decorate my cell phone with salmon cheats?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I'll be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic courts can also take a less appetizing form to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasantly.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest Handy-stand has the form of melted ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also rice balls (onigiri), earrings and wristbands made of dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">For more bizarre plastic dishes you can look at: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow on Twitter the hashtag #.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend, then this video gives you an insight into the district of Kappabashi, dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports of domestic and foreign media about the infamous "struggle against drug trafficking" in Mexico, the missing and disagreed regularly only appear in statistics. these, however, do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle entails.</seg>
<seg id="750">The reports on drug bosses such as El Chapo GuzmÃ¡n, the head of the Sinaloa Cartel, completely forced the stories of the victims of the conflict into the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">The day after a violent incident, hardly anybody looks at the bereaved or the communities who have learned to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">Behind each corpse, behind each bone find in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds may never heal.</seg>
<seg id="753">That is why the Mexican news portal Animal PolÃ­tico has launched the digital project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "live with the drug trade"), which tells these victims a voice and tells stories of people who were involved in the struggle between the law enforcement authorities and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal PolÃ­tico describes the project like this:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organized crime not only makes us afraid of our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are far more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, when shops close because they are threatened by drug dealers and entire communities need to travel many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk.</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of the victims</seg>
<seg id="759">"" "a video titled" "" "Vidas que Cambian por el miedo" "" "(German:" "" "how anxiousness lives" "" ") tells exactly these stories." ""</seg>
<seg id="760">A main character is Guadalupe, a father who searches secret graves after his son every weekend.</seg>

<seg id="774">"" "" "" "we must not only show the faces of those who fear. we must show the international community the conflicts, fragility and state leadership." ""</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports from journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a reader of Animal PolÃ­tico, wrote this post from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal, no matter what form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I have known disease and sensationalism for several years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">Every day I come to the newspaper kiosks and see the front pages with pictures, which can only come from a textbook for criminology or from acts of specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one that is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to that body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I can't be indifferent about it or consider it normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks he wants to become Narco (German: drug dealer) if he's big. and it's also not normal that people hear songs about the "heroic deeds" of the offenders when they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me this is as if they tasted those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something like that happens to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">People's innocence is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village can be justified with that they were "soaking."</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they are trying to argue that they are spared from such tragedies when they do not touch and remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the article "Four Months Erpressing in the Capital of the Capital": how a family was looted by threats of money for month until they end up destroying not only business but also torn their family apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything that you have lost and how many people can completely change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain never passes, the trauma stays, the fear comes up again when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, phone numbers too.</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact you if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The farther we are from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She closed her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want the others to be arrested, because you don't know when they will kidnap you or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">In those terrible days, I wondered if tears would dissolve my deep-rooted feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I must learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">"" "the journalist Mario GutiÃ©rrez Vega has published the article" "" "The Forgotten Children of Ciudad JuÃ¡rez: a Generation of Violence" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction, he raises questions like: who cares for the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents care for them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a orphan and he tells him to teach himself how to cook an egg, fry potato, tortillas warm and make "Chichi" for the babies who live with him. this is his name for preparing the bottle with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for each year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - inexpressible for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was past two years before, when he was just a few blocks from his home, seeing the bloody corpse of his father, who had been shot by armed men out of a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in JuÃ¡rez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006, when violence was mixed with the organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in JuÃ¡rez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010, JuÃ¡rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders according to the citizen's council for public security and government of the United States Government.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the public prosecutor's office numbered 3103 murders. this corresponds to 8.5 Mordes per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories behind organised crime in Mexico and invade the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories continue to live in the face of new headlines. however, this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco," Animal PolÃ­tico has launched the data journalism project Narcodata, whose goal is to portray the complex information behind the failed campaign against drug trafficking, which has been tormented by the country over the past four decades.</seg>
<seg id="816">When a picture is worth a thousand untrue words</seg>
<seg id="817">"sharing is Caring" by Flickr user Niklas WikstrÃ¶m (CC-BY-NC 2.0) WARNMENT: this post and the pages to which he links, contain images on which violence is represented.</seg>
<seg id="818">The fact check is important at a moment when it comes to lifting up a rumor or exposing a falsification.</seg>
<seg id="819">But how is the years after something has appeared for the first time? content in social media, whether it's true or untrue, tends to continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="820">Let us take this photograph of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first release it has been misleading to portray tragedies that have actually occurred in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This false coupling of image and event - "false description" or "wrong context" in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample careful reporting on events in DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for images to news.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010, a tanker crossed the village of Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tipped and exploded. 230 people died.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war, Africa's second largest country was neglected for years and devastated. the streets in the region became dangerous trails full of potholes which were difficult to navigate.</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically, the tank truck fell victim to it.</seg>
<seg id="828">Government representatives described a fireball that enveloped dozens of houses including a movie theater nearby which was full of people watching the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses burned and chartered corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burnt to innocence.</seg>
<seg id="831">A picture titled "That is Nigeria." by Imgur-User Mystical Monkey, January 12, 2015.Several photos of the incident atrophy the horrible scenes of this day.</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of stolen bodies that are strung on the ground while persons watching them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here history does not end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years, the same photo was repeated several times on social media, blogs and other platforms and wrongly attributed to real but not related tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, combatants from Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigeria towns of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eye witnesses dramatically told the atrocities they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burnt down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "but the figures could not be confirmed." "" "no one remained behind to count corpses," "" "said a citizen to Human Rights Watch." ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many had been dismembered, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only on the basis of satellite images the follow-up time could be illustrated figuratively.</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack was also unsolved, but the Army base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigerian and the attempt by Boko Haram to win land (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture from the DR Congo appeared again, when it was falsely presented as evidence of the fact and possible extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">That is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this abusive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of false attributions. Africa Check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases, the picture was presented as a testament to mass killings.</seg>
<seg id="852">One step further further personal comments such as this example wrongly falsely reflect the image of the DR Congo with sources of the mass media in order to provide arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The picture from Sange appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a lightning announcement, published by the United Nations describes those who were able to escape blows, rape and several dead, some through burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported of the violence against Rohingya, posts appeared like the following, bringing together these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news site, falsely claiming that President Myanmars Thein Sein have said that monks and politicians would have participated in the assassination of Rohingya Muslims. additionally, she had used the image of DR Congo to portray this information.</seg>
<seg id="857">The original contribution, which was accessed last April 26, 2017, can be viewed here.</seg>
<seg id="858">Other news organizations called AFP as their source also wrongly attributed Thein to this statement, but did not have the image of the DR Congo related.</seg>
<seg id="859">The worldwide range of false information</seg>
<seg id="860">Traces of these false stubbles go back to the years 2011 and 2012 and actually come from all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="861">Using an "reverse picture search" you can see how far information can cross borders.</seg>
<seg id="862">An inverted image search with the search engine TinEye has found 344 pictures below 18.8 billion pictures (as of May 3, 2017), which are very similar to the said image from the DR Congo.</seg>
<seg id="863">They come from a mixture of private sites, platforms of social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English, Russian, Spanish, Arabic, Dutch, German, Greek and Portuguese.</seg>
<seg id="864">Some have passed false reports, some have attempted to expose falsifications.</seg>
<seg id="865">We have incorporated some examples of abusive use and associated them to the respective countries on the basis of which page they have been published on which page they have been published. thus, we want to show the range more clearly than by the language alone.</seg>
<seg id="866">Several examples of abusive use may come from the countries listed below (which in some cases also have been interconnected).</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and images</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong themes or frames (framing) that go through these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photograph was used with regards to greater discussions about the silence in connection with the killings of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the murders of Rohingya by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the picture to discuss how an African life is underestimated as compared to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">To understand religion and the value of human life is important both. therefore, it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">A deeper question, however, is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media, there are tens of people who inadvertently share the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Suggests this mood of false and false information that actual atrocities are untrue and narrows the actual horror of what actually happened in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of violent images has already been debated in detail (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">One argument is that refusing images of a refusal will be the same as acknowledging the tragedy. sometimes these images are even requested by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern is that violent images desensitise readers and viewers and take the ability to feel empathy (such as this study, which examined how violent media are working to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is a lot to discuss in terms of violent views in the news media, it is a fact that they are indispensable for today's news reporting.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists are experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against "fake news." they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something which can actually be detached from the context or in a completely improper way.</seg>
<seg id="940">However, any investigation of false attributions should also take into account how international they can be.</seg>

<seg id="944">A blog named untranslatable (e. g. invaluable) tries to offer language-inspired a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not to translate at all.</seg>
<seg id="945">Such words are in every language: they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these irreplaceable words are already well known today (like the famous Portuguese saudade) and others deeply rooted in a special culture (for example the Spanish sobmesa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all resist any attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">A word or an expression is not enough, which is why a full explanation and sometimes something context is necessary to understand exactly what is meant with this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected in an online list for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists cover Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and linguist of "untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">For example, in the blog you can find words from the Mwophone language of Vanuatu, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" - Bemba to your parents in recognition of how they have tried to keep you in your younger years.</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunswick language spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"kwadi" - Comfort or laziness you feel after having warmed up in the sun on cold days.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds's own words from his blog about:</seg>
<seg id="956">They defuse other cultures, reveal other thoughts and arouse our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classify the linguists on this page want to publish even more of these "confusing" words and show how different, valuable and impressive these little languages are.</seg>
<seg id="958">Speakers of the "Treasure Languages," which are highly valued by untranslatable, are invited to upload their favorite words here.</seg>

<seg id="973">Over 400,000 people have been affected since last Friday (26 May) and around 100,000 people were transported to 304 stainless steel locations.</seg>
<seg id="974">Rainfall began on Saturday (May 27), and the water levels in some areas were slowly coming back.</seg>
<seg id="975">Health and hygiene conditions of the population are a massive challenge in the affected and still inaccessible areas.</seg>

<seg id="1134">Initiative for storyteller aims to preserve urban linguistic diversity</seg>

<seg id="1136">Can there be a possibility to contact someone here and now despite a language barrier?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Treasure Language storytelling (TLS) initiative, the number of stories in their original language is a possible answer to it.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird, the insurmountable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, the focus of TLS is not on the written word but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language diversity of large cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oakland in the United States, where TLS has held events since 2015, the risk that small and not very small languages are not passed on to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">The following applies to the creators of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities that embrace diversity - safe spaces where people don't have to forget who they are to belong.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while" "" "listening to it is often associated to" "" "understanding" "" "these events instead" "" "listening to appreciate, to feel, to socialize" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format storytellers discuss their story first in their own language and translate or interpret them in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not a professional story teller, their devotion and representation lead to the fact that the audience listens to it.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They evoke laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows, for example, a traditional story from Burkina Faso, which is told in the language Dafing. during this round, the storyteller, Rassidatou, takes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative art for her country.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event, John Nyugara tells the fable of the bunny and the Baboon in Shona's language from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">After explaining the meaning of his parable, John Nyugara is asked: "how to speak to an audience that doesn't understand your language?" with a wide grin he shares his sense of inclusiveness:</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened to it!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were totally with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">Up to now, the events of Treasure Language storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organizers hope to extend this. anyone who is inspired by the project can contact TLS to organize their own story screenings.</seg>
<seg id="1154">Puerto Rico asks the US to reestablish public debt</seg>
<seg id="1155">With the aim of reviewing the public debts of Puerto Rico, which amounted to 72 million US dollars, several religious and civil organisations participated in a mass demonstration last April 3, 2017; the March started at the gangran Capitol, the government building of the capital, and proceeded to the Plaza de ColÃ³n in the old town of San Juani.</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was proclaimed by the group "Frente Ciudadano por la AuditorÃ­a de la Deuda" (Civic Front for the Notification of Debt) and the ecumenical Church Assembly of Puerto Rico.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The advocates of the resettlement of debt also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their requirement:</seg>
<seg id="1159">The people of Puerto Rico ask that politicians, bankers and government agencies responsible for the debts are held accountable for their corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1160">"" "" "" "we call for a financial audit and a Steering Committee without personal interests in public debt, with a fixed, working conditions related to the economy acting in favor of the economy." ""</seg>
<seg id="1161">We are blackmailed and oppressed.</seg>
<seg id="1162">The people of Puerto Rico refuse to pay a debt that is not theirs.</seg>
<seg id="1163">We will not choose between education and health.</seg>
<seg id="1164">Our pensioners will not be reconciled with declining pension payments.</seg>
<seg id="1165">We demand immediate action.</seg>
<seg id="1166">The island - not the sovereign territory of the United States - suffers from a severe financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="1167">Therefore, the so-called "Zentrum fÃ¼r Neue Wirtschaft," a non-profit non-profit organisation without party affiliation, proposes a law on state responsibility, as an alternative to the existing state supervisory authority.</seg>
<seg id="1168">These are their reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1169">The economic and financial crisis of Puerto Rico requires a wide restructuring of state infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="1170">Measures imposed from outside will be at risk without the participation and convictions of citizens to be rejected by the people.</seg>

<seg id="1182">The Syrian-Palestinian web developer Bassel Khartouil, also known as Bassel Safadi, has been missing for over a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and members continued the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he made for an open network.</seg>
<seg id="1185">This year's re: Publica, the annual conference on digital culture hosted in Berlin, was dedicated to the # FreeBassel campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1186">MÃ©lanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the London-based CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara RÃ¼hling, managing director of book sprints, produced books within three to five days, read excerpts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The Cost of Freedom: a Collective Future Research).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book, which was published last year and is freely available here, contains a series of articles dealing with the free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it says:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book wants to discuss how to build movements for free knowledge and what are the real costs associated with it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movement for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our newsfeeds and to make some sense out of our various experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartouil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15, 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was taken from the directory of the Adra prison in which he sat on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then, we have no information about its current state or whereabouts.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book entitled Collective Remembrance gives his friends and family a voice that will push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom, instantly.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Seeing how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture has many of us start thinking about their own destinies, actions and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process from times of extreme convictions?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital assets has been in the custody of Syrian government authorities since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred to an unknown location from the Adra prison, a non-military institution.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the "military police basel had taken part as a" strictly secret "command of the military tribunal in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that she had been contacted by people on November 12, 2015 who presented themselves as the insiders of the Assad administration and informed them of an alleged death sentence against their husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">But his whereabouts and conditions remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the general public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and currently the director of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Basle's cultural prototypes was foresighted than the work he began with a group of archeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyras.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archeological sites in the world, was the crossroads of many civilizations and here Greek-Roman architecture styles merge with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">At that time, Bassel was not able to know that ten years after he began working with this work, the IS would do everything to embody this architecture, which embodies not only the cultural heritage of Syria but of the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This journey into digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Obviously, Bassel hasn't been able to finish this project yet.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my whole life dream of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel taught me English even when he was already in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read, write and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked. he taught other prisoners to read, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught other prisoners how to use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of waiting (waiting), a commission which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 her husband when he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together on the book for a year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the lyrics to him when he visited him and he translated them from Arabic into English.</seg>

<seg id="1248">Since the protests in 2011 against the Bashar al-Assad regime, more than 65,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights (Syrian Network for Human Rights).</seg>
<seg id="1249">Those who were arrested or disappeared under the regime of force were tortured or even executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">By 2016, according to the International Human Rights Organisation, Amnesty International died at least 17.723 Syrians in detention.</seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many other people remain unknown.</seg>

<seg id="1254">Mozambique: vice-president of corruption sentenced to previous post</seg>
<seg id="1255">Mozambique reacted with anger to a corruption incident in which a government member returned after half of his sentence to the workplace in the state apparatus where corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">It is Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and, together with four other defendants, was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment for an offsetting of 54 million Metikal (about 800 000 Euros).</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds from the airport of Mozambique, whose advice was Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 for good guidance and immediately demanded his re-adjustment to the company, which happened on April 19.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement by the Attorney General of the Republic, which rejected the request, there would be no obstacle for Cambaza to return to his old posts since the company did not perform disciplinary proceedings after his detention.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many people do not like the action well.</seg>
<seg id="1261">In an interview with Deutsche Welle, the Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integrida de PÃºblica, CIP) condemned the decision of the company to re-establish the director in an interview with Deutsche Welle:</seg>
<seg id="1262">Is a setback in the fight against corruption and highlights the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards to the efforts of our legal system, such as CIP.</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we take note of is that the company should have initiated a disciplinary approach against the offence.</seg>
<seg id="1264">However, the company apparently kept silent and did not take appropriate legal steps to apply the appropriate functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">EgÃ­dio Vaz, a significant voice in the Mozambican social media, also rejects this behaviour and considers the case as "contradictory."</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza was a competent type, he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to prison and half of whom had eaten half.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could give paid lectures and motivational speeches, he could advise and polish his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he agreed to be integrated into the company, which he helped to harm.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it is obvious: Cambaza is fond of being paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Contradictory!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says the director does not possess any morals:</seg>
<seg id="1272">"" "" "" "Cambaza is rewarded by the state because he insulted him, I can't believe that you are rewarded by someone who has already insulted the state so massively." ""</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza lacks the morale to return and serve the state, * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead he only served himself in the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as an inexhaustible source of money and the state itself has become tired of this man who was accused and eventually sentenced to a long prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarding.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey ZeÃºte prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, to remember that a thief belongs to prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves belong to the prison Samora Machel will not only remain in memory for the Mozambique cans but also as the first independent president, but also as a sharp, single-edged and - by the way - prophetic speakers.</seg>

<seg id="1287">"" "the Burmese word" "" "Kalar pae" "" "means chickpeas or splinters." ""</seg>
<seg id="1288">Photo by Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia article, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported</seg>
<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took up their posts from the net, because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although the origin of the word is still being discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of eastern origin or generally used as adjective "Indian."</seg>
<seg id="1291">As part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma, the word "Kalar" or the "Kalar" is part of an initiative.</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely depreciating connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word used mostly by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims, representing a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in the effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">"" "" "" "Kalar 'may normally be associated with racism, but the word itself does not automatically call forth hate speech." ""</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that even posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubts for their use.</seg>
<seg id="1297">In addition, there are several Burmese words with basic meanings that have the same character sequence as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, it is written on Burmese also 'Kalar htaing' containing the same letters as other words like 'Kalar pae' (Spider bse), 'Kalar OAT' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebooknucker Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post from one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he asked his friends in a witty way whether they knew how to ease his back pain by making a pun.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The sentence ku la - "healing" (ku) + the question word (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist phrase, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Htet is convinced that she will reduce hate speech by radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytical before deleting all posts that are suspected of spreading racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook does not delete the word "Kalar" manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automatism will not understand what you are writing at Faceook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and control it by checking the words next to it.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example, "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae" (splinters).</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that these dirty nationalists who spread hate speech receive a fairly good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to prune their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action may send a strong signal to all who hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have proved that the censorship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game, whereby users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or alternative notation of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook started to delete his posts when he wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' was banished from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I became aware of this new directive from Facebook, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my post was removed from Facebook and I was banned from posting, posting and sharing content for 24 hours, because the post "Facebook community standards did not correspond."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed many posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, which has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author has given his opinion why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism are bad in the country.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet Community to ask for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook likes to have a benevolent intent to lessen racism in Burma through its platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will bring more hatred within the various communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">In addition, it seems that they have started this without a local context or technical support and have banned words such as "chair" or "pea curry."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the fake posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they had little more respect for the 15 million benefits that gave them a big turnover, that would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">"" "" "" "Facebook" "" "automated censorship has caused a lot of mockery among users." ""</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word 'Kalar' in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the net.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts, which did not contain hate speech, but were still removed:</seg>

<seg id="1336">Over the past five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists who have used social networks to expand their voices and influence have increased.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, hate speech in social networks is said to incite violence in Myanmar's communities, especially in the Rakhine region, where confrontations between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to flee.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook has been criticised for its failure to control suspelling hate speech on its Burmese pages.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But instead of simply censoring the word 'Kalar', it would have been better to look at context rather than code-focused initiatives and learned from them.</seg>

<seg id="1343">The child before is now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago.</seg>
<seg id="1344">On 9 June 2017, the parliament of the country unanimously approved a law to prohibit this practice, so that the age-capable age is now at 18.</seg>
<seg id="1345">In May 2016, Brother Harrypersad Maharaj, the leader of the various religious groups in the country, said that the state should not interfere unless the age does not have maturity. "</seg>
<seg id="1346">This happened in spite of the fact that Trinidad and Tobago are a contract partner of the UN Convention on Child Rights, the minors as "defined" every man under the age of 18.</seg>
<seg id="1347">Statistics of the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the share of children married to 15 was 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tobago, and with 18, it was 8.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011, the Federal Statistical Office confirmed that from 1997 to 2007, more than 8400 girls and 1,300 boys were married under 19.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media motions, which were anxious to abolish laws on childbirth, followed at the foot and enjoyed great support. undoubtedly, they helped to bring this result.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Nevertheless, everything went smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "an Hindu leader, for example, had no qualms about telling the critics of the kiddies, they should try to take care of their own affairs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this actually uncomplicated matter, and at some point doubts came on whether the opposition would agree to the draft law at all.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But at the beginning of 2017 the bill against child marriage was decided - despite 4 senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent who abstained, so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him the law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">"" "" "" "now only the president of the country has to agree and let the law be proclaimed." ""</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the senators of the country announced on Facebook a status update, which Leslie-Ann Boiselle posted on Instagram again:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill against child marriage was voted in the House of Representatives with 35 votes and no one against it.</seg>
<seg id="1357">Having previously decided in the Senate, the draft may now become a law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of social media users were thrilled, because the laws of childbirth had finally changed.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Facebook member Lovell Francis, who held a ministerial office in the Ministry of Education, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">It took too much time and unnecessary talk, which disguised the core of the matter, but do you know what? the child before is now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago, and that is worth almost any price.</seg>
<seg id="1361">While Abel Jackson was of the opinion, it was definitely long enough to abolish the practice, Lara Quirall-Thomas was overjoyed that the day had come:</seg>
<seg id="1362">Public status update on Facebook von Lara Quentral - Thomas, which states: News, Excellent news!</seg>
<seg id="1363">The Act has been approved.</seg>
<seg id="1364">Minimum age - 18, Voices - 35 for it - 0 against it!!!! "</seg>
<seg id="1365">Torture Mutota, which belongs to the Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD), a civil society group, who spoke quite openly about how important the adoption of the law was, noted:</seg>
<seg id="1366">The marriage-capable age in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent of the religious affiliation 18 years.</seg>
<seg id="1367">The draft for the amendment of the Act was adopted today on 9 June 2017.</seg>
<seg id="1368">There were 41 deputies in the House of Representatives and 35 were present at the vote.</seg>
<seg id="1369">"" "" "" "all MEPs who were present have voted for the law." ""</seg>
<seg id="1370">The childbirth is not permitted by law in Trinidad and Tobago.</seg>
<seg id="1371">It was a long struggle (...).</seg>
<seg id="1372">Many thanks to all the activists who fought him.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Congratulations.</seg>
<seg id="1374">A thank you to our deputies.</seg>
<seg id="1375">However, a possible clash comes in the form of Sat Maharaj, the secretary general of Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, the most famous Hindu organization of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1376">Months ago, Maharaj announced his intention to take legal action, the law should be passed, and he seems to fulfil his promise.</seg>
<seg id="1377">While the Attorney General Paris Al rawi, an advocate of the law, said it was quite legitimate if Maharaj wanted to act against the law, most social media users wanted to approach the debate on the subject differently.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worrell suggested:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Instead of talking about the problem, instead of talking about the problem, instead of talking about the problem that the state, our daughters protect them from being abused against them, "would you then be willing to continue the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you think that this is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">But whether it comes to a judicial action against the law or not, this legislation is an important step - however, there are still places in the world where the child's marriage in different gradations is legal or continues to be the norm although there are laws which they fail.</seg>

<seg id="1390">By mirroring web pages, Turkish users can view Wikipedia content again</seg>
<seg id="1391">The English-language Wikipedia page was presented on January 18, 2012 contrary to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright legislation in the USA, internationally darkened.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For over a month now Turkey has been blocking the popular and crowdsourcing principle based on encyclopedia Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day after day, it becomes clear how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students as well as reporters and fans of TV series fight against blocking.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many tech-savvy Internet users are used to use circumference tools for blocked websites (an up-to-date article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence in the world), most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been blocking articles from Wikipedia, as described recently in a published report by Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blocking of the Internet has been held since 2007, after the Internet Act (No. 5651) was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">According to China, Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform continues to be blocked, multiple mirrors (pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and are frequently updated) are dipped.</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform laid down all the Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized peer-to-peer network, which does not support the system of domain names and thus makes a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">However, the content is available in spite of legal prohibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post, IPFS reports about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After we have heard the news (about the blocking of Wikipedia), we put everything in place to screen snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. thus, the possibility of reading the contents on a decentralized and distributed way is possible.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to at least view all Wikipedia content, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also indicated that this step was carried out independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is only about screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni of Wikimedia Italy has produced both tr.vikiansiklopedi.org, a Mirrorseite of Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that anyone can use to host similar Mirrors pages when locked in the relevant country Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices Member and employees of Mozilla at the Panigrahi's Open Speaks "Podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy address, a mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">You access another URL that is not the original. that which you can see is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Essentially, the server transfers the request to the correct Wikipedia page, so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia, even if they are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">This is done by a server not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1414">A succeeding Nashorn, Chitwan.</seg>
<seg id="1415">Photo by Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were blurred with badly positioned motifs and washed colours.</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to carry a camera and try to straighten the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring Nepalese wildlife to the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his hometown, next to the Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to take photographs that draw attention to Neptune's wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this prime location helps him in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I was at home just when Navaraj (the manager of the Chitwan Gaida Castle) suddenly called me. he had received a call from my father that a leopard would be on the banks of the Rapti River.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The KurfÃ¼rstendamm is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father had watched him and showed me the place on the other river side, where the leopard was located and I immediately began to kneel pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar seeks cooperation with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition of Nepal's nature and wants to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as scary as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he ought to know, for he stood Tigers face to face,</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger cannot be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep during sleeping!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also I was on the way home because of the darkness, when suddenly the King of the Bud appeared. he immediately sat down, we see ourselves and he stares at me through the Sal-trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar placed the logo "I click for conservation."</seg>
<seg id="1435">However, his passion for promoting Nepalese nature and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days, and usually lived in a tent to take photographs of Otters at Bardia National Park. until 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodations.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This post was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and was originally published by Video Volunteers, an award-winning international collaborative media organization from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was once again published as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, women are avoiding women with the greatest care to pronounce the names of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead they use a pronoun or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women admit that due to their social pressure they should respect the husband, and fear of the consequences should disregard the norm to keep this practice alive.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year Malati Mahatoto was tried by the Indian State of Odisha by a pseudo-court and rejected by her family and the community of the village after she had addressed a married relatives with her name.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of naming their wives by name is also common among men. however, they have far less fear to fear, if any, they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the district of Pune in Maharashtra, nine women, including health personnel and housewives, joined a unique club and became the main theme of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them, in which they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states, he is part of the # KhelBadal campaign, operated by the video Volunteers community and campaigning for the dismantling of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Paz has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera to cover practices such as children's marriage and banishment of HIV and AIDS infected, and manages this club.</seg>
<seg id="1480">She reports how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time have made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video that Rohini showed in their discussion rounds dealt with women who do not call their husbands by name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this topic because she wanted to open the conversation about the patriarchy with a problem with which the women can easily identify.</seg>
<seg id="1483">It is a custom that they all maintain and never questioned the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not consider this is considered a deceitful woman, as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this until this round of discussions.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning Rohini, who had never called her husband by name, wanted to try out at home, as it runs.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the panel discussion with her husband and mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"" "Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said that I should call him from now on by his name." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this confidence in the luggage, Rohini began their first discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "Patriarchate" before. some believed it was a good thing because it meant that younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, the women tried to get the discussion going.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked each participant to say her husband's name with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">"" "then she asked all," "" "If we cannot tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us how they want, does that mean they don't respect us?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1499">"" "should it not be equivalent?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they gave their husbands on their lips," says Rohini Pawas of the village of Walhe in Maharashtra about breaking a centuries-old tradition in which married women never allowed to pronounce the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that during the whole exercise she only giggled in front of herself; another decided to let out the whole stuffed frustration with him and his family by cursing him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Still in adrenaline rush about having broken with an ancient custom, the women decided that at home they would actually try to name their husbands by their name.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days, Rohini received a lot of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put the women in her head: his wife could not stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it during dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law stared her, she was frightened and said that it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">"" "another woman said," "" "Rohini said I should do it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation was in force.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices such as wearing the zinox-red dot on the forehead, indicating the Ehvestatus:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women only have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband that I would wear the zinox-red dot, if he did it too.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only and I stopped wearing it.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not stopped completely, but think they are now in a better position to choose themselves to not wear it on some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "" "" "we make a trip with every discussion club." ""</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "I don't want women to worry about who could hear something," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last months they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes for the first time in their lives; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought about before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so honestly about certain things, for example, how our identities have attached to our husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to be able to say things loudly, no matter how small they happen to be.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round, we talked about the concept of honor and how it is related to clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only carried saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most things this is okay, but some wanted to wear a Salem-Kurta, a wide shirt over a pants, they did not dare.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After a lot of dispute and discussion about the advantages of their own choice of clothes, the moral of the saris and much more, Rohini smuggled their own couple of Kurtas (upper shirts) into a discussion round so that women could wear them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they decided to plan a trip to Goa, where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will do it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question of whether something has changed in the five months since its first discussion club, Rohini confirms that things slowly come into play:</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have only done small steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it for a few times, but then stopped telling her husband's name.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, are still doing it, but only when they are alone and no other family members are there.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women are wearing Zinnoberrot on their foreheads at any time.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the haggling for more freedom of movement or the choice of clothes - lie at the end of a difficult to navigate flow.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How to explain Rohini:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each one of us is a victim of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am also.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people what we are talking about and what we are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1549">On June 29th of this year, the hashtag was to be seen in the Japanese Twitter trend where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beatles.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The visit of the Beatles in 1966 in Japan is regarded as a turning point in the Japanese culture of the post-war period.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The first Japanese journalist, Hoshika Rumiko, who exclusively interviewed the Beatles in London in 1964, marked the 50th anniversary of the first visit:</seg>
<seg id="1552">For just under five days the Beatles were in the country, but this was enough to let the Japanese go through.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The people here have quickly become clear that they had no choice but to receive the Beatles with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Many known Japanese sizes had reached their zenith, when the Beatles came to Japan for the first time in 1966.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The music of the cult band is "more than just a universal language as English," Ryuichi Isaka, president of the retail giant Seven & amp; i Holdings, the online magazine Nikkei Asian Review.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Good morning!. today is the Beatles memorial day in Japan. at least 51 years ago they were here in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="1557">Also today songs from the Beatles are sung in Japanese karaoke bars and in English classes at Japanese central schools.</seg>
<seg id="1558">The Kitsch of the Beatles survives everything.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Today is Beatles memorial day.</seg>
<seg id="1560">We all love the Beatles in our house.</seg>
<seg id="1561">I don't know if this "Winnie the Pooh" doll should be John Lennon or not.</seg>
<seg id="1562">And as it is for fans, Japanese, of course, also make pilgrimages to the well-known places associated with the band.</seg>
<seg id="1563">If you love the Beatles, that's your 5 places that you absolutely have to visit.</seg>
<seg id="1564">1) Abbey Road</seg>
<seg id="1565">2) Mathew Street (in Liverpool)</seg>
<seg id="1566">3) Strawberry Fields (memorial in New York)</seg>
<seg id="1567">4) Penny Lane</seg>
<seg id="1568">5) (Vom Link) The Beatles Story (Museum), Liverpool</seg>

<seg id="1583">The police of ZambÃ©zia warned the population that bald men could be a target of attacks in Mozambique.</seg>

<seg id="1585">A new system of kidnapping of bald people for organ trafficking, probably for non-religious purposes, is worried by the police of ZambÃ©zia, a province in Mozambique. the local government has now called for a number of operations to stop the practice.</seg>
<seg id="1586">At the beginning of the month, three men were killed in the district of Milk, a few kilometers from the border to Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1587">One of the victims was decapitated and part of the organs had been taken.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Two men were arrested and subsequently they confessed that the bodies of shamans in Tanzania and Malawi are used.</seg>
<seg id="1589">There is the local superstition that the head of a bald man could reveal gold or bring wealth, the police spokesman of ZambÃ©zia of the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="1590">It is the first time that successive attacks on long-headed men were registered in Mozambique.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Another group, the goal of killings for obscure purposes, are people with albinism.</seg>
<seg id="1592">This led to the UN 2016 in the South African country to carry out a mission to investigate this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The persecution of people with albinism is common in other countries of southern Africa, especially in the neighbouring country of Tanzania, where the government has developed campaigns to combat these superstitions and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Ukombe Weya lives in Maputo city.</seg>
<seg id="1595">He warned those who plan to travel to the country:</seg>
<seg id="1596">Respect for bald men who travel to Mozambique for long-headed men in Mozambique are the target of ritualistic attacks, the Mozambican police warned of the latest killings of three bald men due to their body parts.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Two suspects were arrested in the district of Milk, where the killings took place.</seg>
<seg id="1598">Hushed Algy Adamo, student and inhabitant of the city of Inhambane in the south of Mozambique, said that the local police have already followed the case:</seg>
<seg id="1599">PRM believes that the shamans are involved in the death of the bald men.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The persecution and murder of single-headed individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Morrumbala, province of ZambÃ©zia, for probable rituals, has cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional shamans (PRM), which also indicates that a faith exists, according to which the victims in the head might have power generating riches.</seg>
<seg id="1601">In recent days, three men have been killed with hair loss problems in this part of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1602">On Facebook Angela Ferreira Samantha shared the chronicle of the blogger poor Snaippa explaining that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Mozambique:</seg>
<seg id="1603">I MÃCHTE like to be ashamed of a country in which people would have shame to demand sex against good marks, and even take their lives to earn their bread, a land where people would not hurt or even take their lives to earn their bread, a land in which neither the Albinos nor kahle or bald-headed for superstitious purposes or "black magic" are hunted to achieve sexual richness.</seg>
<seg id="1604">Despite the seriousness of the phenomenon, some of the opportunities for macabre humour could not be missed.</seg>
<seg id="1605">Zenaida's Machado, scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Mozambique and enthusiastic Twitter user, tweetete that both the head of the district Morrumbala, Pedro Sappenheim, and the police spokesman ZambÃ©zias, InÃ¡cio Dina, are both open-minded:</seg>

<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on July 8, 2017 in Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of the imprisoned Chinese dissident, Liu Xiaobo, attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he was hospitalized for liver cancer in the final stage.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to 11 years in prison for "Subversion" (state endangerment) after he participated in the draft Charter 08, a manifesto calling for democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"" "the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Lius case as" "" "an internal affair" "" "and told a spokesperson, he considered it" "" "not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1633">Yet China continues to receive calls from the international community, the Nobel laureate and his wife, poet Liu Xia, to allow him to be treated abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries have criticized the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing, others are completely wiped out.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summarized some reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United Nations and the United Nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">However, a spokesman refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exert pressure to allow Liu to be treated abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway - Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister BÃ¸rge Brende refused to answer questions about Liu's release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway was stalled after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu in 2010, although the Norwegian government announced that this ultimately had nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations continued only in December last year, and only in June Norway was signed an agreement to resume the salmon trip to China, since the exports since 2010 were largely blocked.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Due to his imprisonment, he was unable to accept his price.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony, Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">The European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to immediately release Liu and his wife from house arrest and allow him to seek medical assistance wherever he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The top diplomat of the EU, Federica Mogherini, also called on China to release Liu, as stated in a statement on 30 June:</seg>
<seg id="1649">At the same time, we expect that China lifts all restrictions of Mr. Lius's wife and family members.</seg>
<seg id="1650">They are to meet and receive all visits they desire and be able to communicate freely with the outside world.</seg>

<seg id="1653">A spokeswoman of the U.S. Embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, announced the news agency AFP on 27 June that the message urges Chinese authorities not only to release Liu, but also to release his wife Liu Xia from house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1654">The call of the U.S. embassy drew a furious response from China, with the utterance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that "no country has the right to intervene and make irresponsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley said that China should offer the couple the following:</seg>
<seg id="1656">Protection and freedom, such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of its choice, to which they claim according to the Constitution and the legal system as well as international obligations.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The U.S. Senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz have also adopted a resolution in the Congress to push the Chinese government to release Liu and his wife unconditionally.</seg>

<seg id="1661">Chinese President Xi Jinping appeared on July 7 and 8 at the G20 summit in Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1662">Previously reported diplomatic sources in Beijing at the news agency Reuters reported that China had big concerns about whether the vortex could overshadow Liu's visit to Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada and the USA</seg>
<seg id="1664">On 28 June, Canadian Ambassador John McCallum called on China to provide appropriate medical care to Liu and give him the opportunity to take care of his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Liu lawyer talked to AFP beforehand that Liu's wife, Liu Xia, could visit him every day, but the police always watched the room in the hospital and that Liu is not allowed to speak with someone outside, including his lawyers, to speak and contact.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum continues to say:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"" "" "" "Canada is calling on China to uphold its international human rights obligations, including freedom of expression, and acquit those rights for the exercise of these rights." ""</seg>
<seg id="1668">France and the United Kingdom</seg>
<seg id="1669">France's Foreign Ministry requested China to release Liu for humanitarian reasons in an explanation on 29 June:</seg>
<seg id="1670">All the necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo receives all the treatments he needs, regardless of where. furthermore, his wife and his family should have contact with him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news channel France Info has already reported that Liu's French government would welcome Liu in the country, the State Department announced that there will be no further information whether France will ultimately accept it.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Taiwan Shop in Taiwan</seg>
<seg id="1673">The Council of mainland jobs in Taiwan called on China on 27 June to release Liu and show a greater tolerance towards those who advocate peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Taiwanese legislature Yu Mei-nu from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also called on China to permit the sick intellectual Liu to be treated in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama from the Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual leader in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, was very concerned about Liu in an explanation on June 28, and admitted that many asked him to pray for Liu's well-being.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he was severely punished would have led to a more harmonious, more stable and prosperous China, which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I personally felt very moved and encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, signed the Charter 08 that stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognised as an independent state at an international level.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to K. Shanmugam Justice Minister, Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has sparked a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting at the meeting of the international branch of the Bar Association of New York, the Minister remarked that many people criticised the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because they were compared to Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supported that Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one questioned whether New York was a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is what most people make a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">The Cavalierio blog accuses the Minister of Justice to "twist the logic" to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this valuable land, we hear that ultimately we are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of fleeing the responsibilities, a breach of duty.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose land is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons cited by Shanmugam were not very nobel: he defended an idea according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other "normal countries" in the face of this, he was invariably undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">On the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities like Chicago, San Francisco or New York, likewise cities that are permanently led by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Once you reach the core of the subject, the good old lyre appears again from the authoritarian rulers who pretend to be democrats, leaving the twisted logic, since it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">During the final week of Shanmugam, the answers given to his American guests regarding our press, our judiciary, our political system were really non-replies.</seg>
<seg id="1703">He disguised the corresponding questions with non-answers of rational nature.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls Shanmugam to clarify his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally think it is a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">When Singapore is not a country but a city, so to what country belongs to our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmugam would take the trouble to clear this point as long as it was paid up to be part of the government of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By publishing his comment on the blog, Anon points out to the critics that one should start reading the entire transcript of the conference to better understand the context of Shanmugam's statements, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">When he said that Singapore was rather a "city" than a country, "he explained why the elections in Singapore are so unequal, even if we enjoy free and fair elections.</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "when he said that Singapore" "" "was not a country," "" "he obviously did not mean it in this sense!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, who as leader of an adolescent generation, makes such a polemic statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said.</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard, what I expected - whether I agree with them or not, but that's another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes that, properly associates and is aware of what he defends.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review discovers the weak points of Shanmugam's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"" "did Mr Shanmugam have committed a" "" "good believer" "" "or was it a Freudian speaker?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is not a country, we are only considered an independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, what country will the sovereign rights of Singapore return to?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally land and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since he plays an important role within the cabinet cabinet, Mr. Shanmugam's statements are of serious importance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do the people of Singapore do their military service, but do they defend their city only?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who does our prime minister need to pay back?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink employee ID?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>

<seg id="1729">"" "" "" "I did not say what I said..." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1730">This set seems to have annoyed many people of Singapore...</seg>
<seg id="1731">No one ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>

<seg id="1745">My clarification often follows the standard answer: "Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice hockey, nature." many Canadians maybe cook in front of anger when they are kept for Americans, but that doesn't bother me.</seg>
<seg id="1746">For someone who doesn't know, there is little that Canadians distinguish us from Americans.</seg>

<seg id="1780">A pop band famous in Thailand has published a music video that the junta parools, which in 2014 seized power and, despite their promise, re-establish the civilian government, continues to rule the country.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The new song "Dictator Girl" (Phadet Girl) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man telling what rules his girlfriend makes.</seg>
<seg id="1782">Although not explicitly political, the music video refers indirectly to the continued military rule of the junta.</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country's situation.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The video to the song was a huge success.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Within the first three days, the video uploaded to Facebook was 1.254 times shared and received 8,800 Likes.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Last month, even the Charlie Chaplin video "The Dictator" was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists told the public to watch this video.</seg>
<seg id="1787">The video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, in particular about the situation of the country under the junta rule.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Take a look at these recordings of the video, which relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has persistently pursued over the past three years.</seg>
<seg id="1789">The "44 rules of the girls" may refer to draconian section 44 of the provisional constitution, which gives absolute power to the commander-in-chief of the army on important national issues.</seg>
<seg id="1790">The 11th rule: "change your attitude" refers to the notorious program for the "change of setting" of journalists, students, scientists, activists, politicians and other people considered by the Junta as a critic.</seg>
<seg id="1791">The picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime, whose vague and unclear rules are often exploited by the authorities to arrest activists and other reviewers of the state.</seg>
<seg id="1792">For this purpose, a new unit was established in the army, which monitors online content and accused persons accused of having rejected the monarchy, prosecuted.</seg>
<seg id="1793">Thailand establishes a strict end against "The Most Majesty."</seg>
<seg id="1794">Martial law was proclaimed in Thailand on 20 May 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1795">Two days later it came to a putsch of the army.</seg>
<seg id="1796">One of the problems that the Junta continues to pursue is their decision to buy expensive submarines, although security experts warned them that the purchase was unnecessary and a waste of tax money.</seg>

<seg id="1804">The post-war society slowly recovers in East-Abkhazia, especially in the district of Tkurelal.</seg>
<seg id="1805">Now more than 20 years have passed since the Georgian-Abchashic war officially ended, but its scars are still very visible in this part of the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="1806">The abandoned villages of the northern district in Tkuarchal show striking pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1807">Villages like Dzhantukha, Akarmara, Pyataya Shakhta, Polyana and Kharchava are located in the basin of Abkhazia.</seg>
<seg id="1808">Various ethnic groups such as Russians, Greeks, Swans, Georgians and Armenians lived and worked on Soviet sites in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1809">Many of them had to leave their homes during the war.</seg>
<seg id="1810">Today, most of the Russians and chases are living in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Such settlements are also called ghost cities in Abkasia.</seg>
<seg id="1812">In the pre-war period there were still more than 10,000 people, today there are only a few hundred people in these ghosts.</seg>
<seg id="1813">This phenomenon is characteristic for Tkuikal.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Since 2011, the total population of the district has amounted to 16,000 people, having barely risen over a decade.</seg>
<seg id="1815">In 1989 about 43.000 people lived in this district.</seg>

<seg id="1898">On the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, it is located at the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is led by a 59-year-old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral-pink spectacle frame and gold colored ear-rings in teddy bear-form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. still, they know many under the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is due to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about 2,50 dollars a night the guests sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the vestibule there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no signpost to the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Haitian immigrants come here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">"" "sometimes, Mrs RamÃ­rez tells us, people are coming to full minibus and from the upper part of the coast they start calling:" "" "mother Africa!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the moment it is rather quiet, but this year RamÃ­rez has already received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have been sleeping outside on cardboard boxes.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to reject anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are ill, they buy them medicines they cannot pay, they massage them with a balm of the feet exhausted by the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychque Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived a short time ago.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mum Africa was a reasonable nickname for Mrs. RamÃ­rez.</seg>

<seg id="1919">"" "" "" "yes, yes," "" "he answers with a smile." "" "I really feel it suits her as African women are very nice women." ""</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister, who hopes to come to Boston to find her husband and the three children there.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They have lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on their way to the United States to stop taking a first stop in South America and then heading north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">"" "the family had heard of other companions of Mama Africa." "" "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track," "" "says Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti." ""</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells that the Haitians and Africans often travel along the route and that Africans are already talking about Whatsapp by Ms RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Like many of his companions, Michelet lived in Brazil earlier and worked as a construction worker on building sites for the Olympic Games and the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy became weaker, he began his journey to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest of Mom Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I wonder if he will get in contact with Mrs RamÃ­rez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"mother Africa is our mother and we never let her go again," he answers with a smile. "we will always stay in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Ms. RamÃ­rez tells her guests often send her text messages when she has gone to greet her or to report her about the course of her journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">It declares that their Christian faith is the impulse of their work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to cook poultry like in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Mrs. RamÃ­rez is perhaps very well known here, but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the town, a dead end leads to JesÃºs Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter, Valenzuela and his family have taken migrants in their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has found that the bus tickets to many African migrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He has started to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered them his home for a dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment there are 25 people, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela declares that he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"" "" "" "I lived in the United States," "" "he says." "" "I have experienced what they are experiencing." ""</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people can help and others do not help. that's why I give them my support. "</seg>
<seg id="1946">After having lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants traveling through Tapachula come from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their homes to them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">JosÃ© Antonio Cordova MelÃ©ndez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children before people who wanted money to blackmail him without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked for accommodation and a stranger, a single person, offered him a shelter.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later, the family still lives there and she tries to decide where to go next.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the hallways, travelers will always consult their telephones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus arrived today and brought 20 new guests, most of them from Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Ms. RamÃ­rez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic, because of those who have gone.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother she leaves her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one of her daughter with African hair fleece she has made a client, some photos of her grandchildren and many more, young and old.</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sadly as she briefly introduces it to me.</seg>
<seg id="1958">"Ya sis fueron," she repeated every time. "they have already gone."</seg>
<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">A Check Point for Personal communication devices in Xinjang by Twitter users.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minorities region in western China, are forced to install a spyware on their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On 10 July, cell phone users in the Tianshan Municipality of Urumqi received a cell phone notification, in which it instructs the district government to install a surveillance app called Jingwang (or "web cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "in the announcement, it is said that the app" "" "prevents access to terrorist information" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">"" "" "" "however, the authorities must also use the app for more than fighting terrorism." ""</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the Autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture, because, shortly after they had installed the app, they exchanged messages with a private WeChat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">The police reported that the app would investigate and prosecute the sources and distribution channels of terrorists along with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information" including videos, images, eBooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwang's website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main feature is blocking pornographic sites, from online fraud, trojans and phishing sites to alert users how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with the minors is designed to help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" may enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal the home network of a person.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While reporting on digital censorship in China is mostly focused on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south, reality is very often gloomy for those living in remote, crowded ethnic minorities such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">In order to limit disturbances and discontent in the conflict regions, the authorities often subordinate extreme censors and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shutdowns.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The media outlet "Images from mainland China" (expressed in Twitter), the censored news in China, showed photos of a checkpoint where police indiscriminately checked the inhabitants if they had installed the monitoring app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile alert wanted people to install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are detected at a checkpoint with a device without this software, they may be detained up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They forced the people to use appliances intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity by the rest-growth technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from mainland China" (Throowide Viewing of the People of Europe) also published a Jingwang product description that results in the software uplifting the key requirement of a Windows operating system, thus obtaining unlimited access to the hard drive of the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After installation of Jingwang computers and mobile phones in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The provisions in Jingwang may be a reaction to the directions of the City Council to minimise the spread of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government branches, authorities and institutions connected to the party, including universities and research institutions, are obliged to follow the instructions of the cyber security office when they operate their computers and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A recent report by Freedom House, an American human rights organization, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang, on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi an ordinance with the directive for all residents and entrepreneurs to register their "personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks and media memory cards" at the local police station.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously to identify and destroy any "terrorist videos." however, this action violates the Urumquis's personality rights three million inhabitants and gives them penalties for a number of other possible offences including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib spends most of his time indoors, sometimes he slumps to his screen, sometimes to his computer, sometimes to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what one can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips infested with nicotine.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the topmost storey of his family house, which has belonged to them since 1967; the year that Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and forced Hdaibs family to escape from their village in Palestine, in which they lived as a rock-yeen (about: Farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years, Hdaib has been a passionate activist opposing the conservative majority and questioned their well-established opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapeseed music.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often deals with topics like Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also calls for the core of the entire Arab world. all these issues are not only relevant in his hometown of Amman, but also in cities ranging from Damascus in Syria to Yemen in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With his 25 years, Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not limited in his thinking by borders, and he can feel with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he does not openly admit it, he won a special dislike against U.S. foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those trying to survive in war zones, to do anything with his identity as a "Palestinian refugee of the second generation," he calls himself, even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"" "" "" "I don't think about my own circumstances," "" "Hdaib stresses." ""</seg>
<seg id="2104">Then he adds: "I think so, because I'm a man," while he shook into two cups in water soldered NescafÃ©. it is the holy month of Ramadan; during this time it is planned for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset.</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food is illegal during Ramadan.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Apparently Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with age-old traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee on a silently hot young day has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically, the pieces of lukewarm coffee and the swaths of the Kent-cigarette in the nose speak primarily of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky, especially if you take a look at the neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ramadan to drink water - not to land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the Ministry of the Interior, Jordan, announced a performance by the band Mashrou'Leila, for the second time already.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some MPs who support the Islamic action front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual front singer, Hamed Sinno, contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the concert announcement.</seg>
<seg id="2112">In an interview with CNN, the MPs and former spokeswoman of the Islamic coalition, Dima Tahboub, said that the concert had been cancelled "just" because of the singer's sexual orientation.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many also claim that the involvement of the band on issues such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which poses the proven legitimacy of authoritarian regimes across the region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">"" "in a public statement, Mashrou called the Jordanian people as" "" "progressive supporters of human rights" "", "who continued to vote" "" "for an intellectual and cultural pluralism." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement should probably not be simply seizure rhetoric, but actually reflects an increasingly clear and crystallizing reality in Jordan, which clearly appears in Hdaibs's oeuvre.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016 Hdaib returned to traditional gender norms by making his vision of the fate of Arab women who have marital sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of a clearly trodden unknown woman whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the screen.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they really should trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Over the past few years, the number of "honorary mores" has increased in Jordan, leaving the inofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch, the number of volunteers in 2016 reached its peak; however, it is still aggravating that Jordan has failed to support institutional infrastructure in order to support women who attempted murder or domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law on crime control from 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can be imprisoned for indefinite time in prison, "and for her release is often necessary for years of bureaucratic expenditure and the guarantee by the family that nothing will happen to the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaibs's music enjoys great popularity and is well-known to not shy away from issues that long as taboo in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is political, but admits that he cannot divorce his music, which is full of explicit references to sexuality, freedom and expression.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"" "" "" "I come from the Middle East, man." ""</seg>
<seg id="2125">"" "I was smuggled into politics," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed," Hdaib tackles the question of Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"" "in" "" "Lawla al 3aib" "" "and in" "" "Ghareeb" "", "the focus is again on poverty." ""</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political at the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib released a song called "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is repeated often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"" "" "" "you are free, and everyone else is it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market where you can get what you want "- be it faith or non-belief, hetero- or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that there is hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay men and lesbians and that commentaries on gender equality have been heavily censored by 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014 Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular Yordanian online program Roya, to later remember that his comments were torn, distorted and censored in his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"" "" "" "on Youtube, it was uploaded without any cuts, but streamed only a edited version," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today Hdaib advertises the Arabic LGBTQ + community and believes that intolerance to homosexuals does not justify Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nuit, a poet of the eighth century, who is still remembered today thanks to his homoerotic poetry.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks himself: if Abu Nusomething, who was to work later on behalf of the caliph, could openly write about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanians not do that?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou 'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemy kingdom there is nothing new anymore that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Service held several former government delegations and members of the teacher's association, arguing that they had critically expressed themselves critically on social media comments related to the deeply rooted corruption in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, Hdaibs's opinion is only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him progress is a constant giving and taking. Jordan has now denied Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - this is how it sees Hdaib - consists of slow, thought and inner changes.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Ultimately, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">"" "he does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of" "" "experiencing them." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will be able to approach a real and fundamental openness by means of music, art and literature - and not by bombs, cluster munitions and democratically-induced democracies. at least he hopes this.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until the time has come, Hdaib will continue to rap and therefore resist.</seg>
<seg id="2148">This report was made possible by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, which Aman belongs to as Student Fellow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Nuta in Aomori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These big, extravagant warrior dolls are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebuta festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">It is presumed that it is a variant of the Tanabata festival, which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of Tohokus. another theory states that the ballast, the drums and dancing came over more than a thousand years and come from a period when armies from west Japan marched into the northeast to force the indigenous people of the region, the Emishi, to the knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We were able to pick up some great seats, so we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">It is hard to imagine how large these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A community centre in the capital, Meguro Gayoen, organized a two-month exhibition on Wa no Akari (literally).</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been looking for the Meguro Gayoen for a long time: two solid cars are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend the summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>

<seg id="2167">Outward appearance and personal care were as important as in this story, because they help to keep the Peruvian youth away from crime and to promote a legitimate profession like that of the hairdresser.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historic center of Lima - a region with a very high crime rate, where street robbery and illegal drug trafficking are everyday.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region do not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time Peru, like many other medium- and South American countries, experienced an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, appearance, and therefore also the unusual hairstyles of famous sportsmen such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Chile), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil) has led to more and more normal citizens moving into the experienced hands of hairdressers who can recreate these elaborate hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles, which go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the competition of hairdressers "Batalla de Barberos," which has been taking place since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">There experts compete against each other to show who of them can create the most eccentric looks, as you can see in the following video (further videos on current contests are available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as Augusto Salazar Bondy School, located in El Callao, found an opportunity to persuade young people to exchange their weapons against hairdressing tools and to receive training in hairdressing art, which allows them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and the possibilities offered, dozens of youths have seen that they can take a job which is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Prior to the school year beginning in March, the school offered special training workshops and reported on some of their successes:</seg>
<seg id="2177">In 1995 we were the only school in the community and the district where we are very proud, because out of love for the children we have built this educational community.</seg>
<seg id="2178">Colombia: letter of love to guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">"" "the following article is the edited version of the article" "" "Love messages to guerilla fighters" "", "which the international online magazine Tea After Twelve released." ""</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article is published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Isn't it still much more important to accommodate people who feel ejected?</seg>
<seg id="2185">This is exactly what the two young Colombian activist Leonardo PÃ¡rraga from the BogotArt Foundation and Cristian Palacios from the Young-Youth Foundation inspired her to the campaign Cartas por la-liaciÃ³n (letters to reconciliation) that encourage young people to write letters to guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only recently their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to it: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government signed a peace treaty with the FARC (German: revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia), which constitutes the final point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The signing of the peace treaty was so significant that the Colombian president Jose Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">Before the Colombian people, there is still a long way to talk about real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla fighters, who have lived in illegal camps for many years, were exposed to war rhetoric and were carrying out their arms round the clock, must now re-integrate into life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society, in turn, accustomed itself to life in constant fear and in some cases of profound hatred toward guerrilla fighters, must now take in its ranks and support them in building up a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombians had to join together and help in the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that is exactly what they did: until now thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back into society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The goal of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerilla fighter - to be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as Inspiration for the Campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the letters to reconciliation was created at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in BogotÃ¡ in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk briefly to Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love on Valentine's Day, but forget those who need much more needless.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He planned to share his love with people this year, which needed most urgent attention.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Thus arose the plan to write letters full of hope and support for former FARC combatants who now have to find their place in society and build a new life. "the letters will show that Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war story a common history of peace," they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Up to now more than 2000 letters have been collected during the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia, such as Cali, Manizales, MedellÃ­n, Barranquilla and BogotÃ¡.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i never thought someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Caldono-Cauca region on March 19.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from Javeriana University in Cali, two members of the Municipality of Cali and Leonardo from the BogotArt Foundation travelled to the camp to personally transfer the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The FARC members put themselves in the way they had done earlier in order to accept the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they did not receive orders, but letters full of encouragement from people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for everyone involved. "it's incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and all that lies in between," told the political science student Manuela JimÃ©nez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a member of the Governor of the province of Valle del Cauca described this unforgettable experience like this:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After passing the letters, a former warrior led me through the camp of the guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Cambuches" (a kind of hut in which the guerrillas live), I saw a guerrilla fighter who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go, because next to him on the bed was a MGL-Granatwerfer, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "he said," "" "Hello, what are you doing?" "" "he replied," "" "I answer a letter that someone wrote to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"" "someone has never written such a beautiful thing in my life, so I answer it." "" "suddenly the tears ran across the cheeks." ""</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him very tightly and sat down beside the pomegranates.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was also tired of the war, was tired of being the faithful companion of this fighter all the years and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he had never expected anything else from life than war. joining the FARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers from starvation. "I never thought anyone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society there that waits for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now, I have only learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">But now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity. "</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices and voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">For the prelude, students and a few leaders of the FARC have joined a discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war and the FARC had already acted in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">For this reason, the FARC leaders declared the history of the organization, their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process: "for many years we have experienced how social injustice on the part of the state exerted on the whole of the Colombian people. now, where we have the possibility of developing ourselves into a political party, we can help shape society in this country more equitably.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "for a purpose of this magnitude, it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles," "" "said one of them." ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">To hear these people who never heard anything heard and had no right to vote, and to realize that the people I often had seen as a monster and even hated, were only people with beautiful feelings turned around by their living conditions and their environment was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives, hurts me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and caused so much damage, can teach us something and give us a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have replied to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo GonzÃ¡lez, the camp's commander in Caldono-Cauca, for example wrote DarÃ­o de JesÃºs Monsalve, the Archbishop of the city of Cali, wrote the following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombian was prophesied that there would be peace after disarmament.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as there is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people willing to resort to arms, rise up and protest for their rights. and that is also fully justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">"" "" "" "we of the FARC are now focusing on peace, on a policy without weapons." ""</seg>
<seg id="2235">Therefore we call all defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in the war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and make sacrifices because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2237">There will be many obstacles on our way, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I worked as a helper in a human rights organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day I was told that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">It was a friend from Dagestan, a Transwife who was in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2258">She had no money, so I took her without hesitation.</seg>
<seg id="2259">While I tried to help her, someone I thought would be a friend, a copy of my documents, and spread it all over the internet, with my telephone number and a picture of me. he sent her to his Chechen friends, with the following message: "then there are no men in Chechnya that can eliminate this shame?"</seg>
<seg id="2260">After that the photos of my documents made the round through WhatsApp.</seg>
<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015, I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">When I was doing a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car, I heard a male voice saying, "Here's a gift for you from your uncle."</seg>
<seg id="2263">When I turned around, I felt something in my body, but nothing hurt me.</seg>
<seg id="2264">"" "then I heard a sentence, but this time in Chechnya:" "" "how long do you still want to dishonour the family, you shame?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I just know that it was a young man, not 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and finally woke up in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had heard everything and started screaming.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called a ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In hospital, I learned that I had two stings in my right lung.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which health wings were you placed - in the men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are obsolete, my male name is still on it; but the doctor understood and laid me at the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very thankful for this.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I first read his name at his office, I was afraid to do it; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him for being respectful of me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I received threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me and wrote me - relatives, foreigners, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They asked me to send me back to Chechnya to prove that it was all a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They made absurd demands: some told me that I had to prove it by running on the top without going through the streets; others wanted me to appear in Grozny's official TV and say that I didn't change my sex, that everything was just bad, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what should I have to say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family attempt to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once spoke to my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"" "they said to her," "" "They have brought a monster to the world that has not only damaged your family, but the whole republic." ""</seg>
<seg id="2290">"" "we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you must disappear from here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother was too much and she put a rope around her neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbors came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved into a flat and a few hours later, under the window, there was a car with darkened windows and a number plate with a 95.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it had happened for the third time, I realized that there was a bit lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights activists verified the number plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons I don't want to give up their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With her help I left the country, but then something incredible happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before leaving Moscow, I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought them without registering, without identification, without anything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw her into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked in at the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">In the moment when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message: "you don't think you're in security just because you've left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people know already in which hotel you're in. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">"" "only to prove it to you: it is the number 115." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine that?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">However, we do not talk about gender equality, this is a taboo subject.</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditionally Caucasian elements I carry still in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">As much as I wish, I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with camera, I really try to look at the person they remember from their past - so to my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But this is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends do, those who have stayed dortlessly?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report last week in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For him, I needed up-to-date information on the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I spoke to someone who sat in argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told us that during Ramadan there were no people arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not shut out a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">So I mean they probably charge the relatives who care about the problem with the person concerned and at the end demand evidence that the so called "honor" has experienced through blood satisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are gay men still held in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine tells me there are not so many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, then, especially those who have no rich relatives or who were dropped by their relatives to put themselves on the cadets of Cadyrows.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are held there so that they can be presented as terrorists later.</seg>
<seg id="2333">"" "say:" "" "if they are killed, they will show their bodies on television and claim they have attacked any village or military base." ""</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not simply disappeared, they were specifically submerged in order to radicalise.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is that just a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was imprisoned in argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after having grown beard.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new since then.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They just took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person was himself when these people were taken with him.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Until now, however, they were not presented as bandits, there have been no reports so far. however, we suspect that such actions are quite possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why would you not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know whether these persecutions and kidnappings of people belonging to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation have already taken place in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think already before 2003 I was already known in Grozny when I still lived there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In the seriousness!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999 when the Sharia was considered, I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, at that time it was much safer than it is now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">"" "Russia was originally intended to bring us to" "" "civilising" "", "but ultimately threw us back into the Stone Age." ""</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked; I had colored eyelashes, wore tubular jeans and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Security of Sharia has never scratched me just one hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Before the Russian theater in Grozny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, met a whole group of people like me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several banks were standing, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been insulted.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a saying: Kharda ma Kharda. that is, "Don't worry about the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">People often say it to children when they laugh at the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they simply closed their eyes to you because they thought you were sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They have never offended me, never hunted and never struck me.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this time of grace last?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: until Kadyrow stepped on the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed prime minister in 2005, he began talking about morality in television.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He spoke not about us per se but primarily about the behavior of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - you could feel how people began to change in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Those who had smiled and laughed at first looked at you with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In that time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home I could feel the situation in the republic continuously worse.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you do now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn a lot - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I am still active as an activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organize teetrees, meetings, I accompany them to the hospital and help them to get food-cards.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't spend a cent for it.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself when I paraphrased breeding places.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslims and want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: this is a mystery.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So is nature, that has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same thing as Chechnya, who want to make you white with foam before the mouth that there are no gays on them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagestanans have which, the Cabardines, who, the Russians have, which, on the whole planet, there are they - but "not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">I come from there, so it's unpleasant for me to hear something like that.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men here from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims walking into the mosque and fasting during Ramadan - live with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">You know, many think in transition to men who love males, and they believe that man changes his gender to make more intimate experiences. but that's a fallacy.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different kinds of feeling to be exact, different attitudes of life.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Sorry that I become so personal here, but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I'm not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself.</seg>

<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahwaz region suffers from an unusually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Since the last few months there has been a strong increase in suicide.</seg>
<seg id="2398">The photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patriotic Arab Democratic Movement in Ahwaz.</seg>

<seg id="2400">The self-burning of a man named Jassim MorAmazi on August 27 drew the desperate situation of the Arab Ahwazi community in Iran that is marked by poverty and unemployment, in the spotlight.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al Thawra in the Ahwaz region in the south-west of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness, the inability to pay for his family, according to Ahwazi human rights groups who want to work in Ahwaz and remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video shared on YouTube kept the moments after he had kindled himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people quickly managed to extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was taken to the Taleghani hospital in the city of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the burns were so strong that doctors could no longer do anything.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died short time later.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide that occurred within the Arab Ahwazi-Minority in August, and activists warn that even more men could take life.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have one thing in common: they were all family fathers, who were helpless and unable to feed their families due to the persecution by the Iranian government, and to pursue a safe work.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region, where most of the Arab Ahwazi community living in Iran is based, has been shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it hard for the native Arab population to deny its livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="2412">A century ago, the Arab Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi Monarchy took power in 1925 and took great efforts to end ethnic autonomy in Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran, as well as some of the most profitable and valuable useful areas for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop only slowly, and the local population receives little from this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often the victim of untreated illnesses, hunger and privation.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime systematically refuse the Ahwazi Arabs to work systematically in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government also built a multitude of dams, the waters from the Arab territories in the Persian areas, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom are lying.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only led to aggravate the devastation caused by dryness and destroy the local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab Ahawks now rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian Director General for Cooperative, Labour and Social Welfare, reported that 5% of the Ahwazis who are looking for a job, completed elementary school, completed 55% secondary school and 45% completed a university degree.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"" "a" "" "systematic strategy... aimed at crushing the spirit of national resistance" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2422">Karim Dohimi, an Iranian Ahwazi human rights activist residing in London, told Global Voices that the present situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination," led to a "high rise" in the number of suicide among young Ahwazi men.</seg>
<seg id="2423">"" "" "" "the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians emerging in Ahwaz and an anti-Arab discrimination in the recruitment process:" ""</seg>
<seg id="2424">Because officials and institutions do not favour Arab workers, the local Arab Ahwazi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime aimed at annihilating the spirit of national resistance to young Arabs and forcing them to earn their livelihood outside their home.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their first name and surname in order to hide their belonging to the Ahwazi and be questioned as even Arab names at the workplace are not tolerated, let alone speaking the Arabic language or wearing Arabian clothing.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the circumstances the Arab Ahwazi has to endure, human rights activists suggest alarm before the situation becomes explosive.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world is waking up and taking notice of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is depression.</seg>

<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ayomide Zuri and was originally published on AfrofÃ©minas website.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say I'm not a feminist, many women - especially white women who call themselves intersectional feminists - respond with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even lay well thought-out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a feminist and why we should generally be all feminist * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, women nowadays earn less money today despite equal education than men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social norms always ensure that women sooner or later encounter a glass ceiling in various spheres of life, and that discrimination based on gender is still moving across the many different countries and beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced of this and I suffer twice and threefold under it.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet, when I come to talk about skin color, on racism, on black women women, black women in LGBTIQ community or on black women from the Diaspora; if I mention how we've always been abused physically, emotionally and verbally, both in and outside the feminist movement, many white feminists and white intersectional feminists decide to remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="2448">But nevertheless all agree that women - all women - should come together to "lift their voices and" to sing "my Lord" to reach equal rights (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they don't want to talk about sexualized violence in addition to an institutionalised form of racist motivated violence that we are subjected to black women in two ways.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnicities and places of origin earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with an immigration background can often be referred to school as white girls due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in the partnership than white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want all women to have all men and all men of all skin color the same rights; on the other hand, I can't join a movement as a black woman who refuses to take into account injustices in her mind, which refer to gender as well as the skin color of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my belonging in a white feminist oriented sphere that has rejected me and countless other black women over and over again.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"" "Sojourn complained in her speech in 1851:" "" "am I not a woman?" "" "and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is in a historical sense an unmended and marginalized being." ""</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to join groups who also absorb our customs and customs by cultural appropriation in order to advance their egocentric program.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer attempt to suggest white women the importance of overlapping skin color and sex, for some of them will continue to remain silent on the importance of black women for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women are trying to reward them for the better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although the intersectionale feminism was founded in order to give women of different origins a home and isolate oneself from the white feminism, the word "feminism" still lies in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to get rid of feminism and join the movement of Womanism, which was created for my dark skin and my status as a woman, rather than using me for a white feminist paradigm that is so stubborn that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever that we black women define us according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clarka Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana womanism: reclaiming (such as: Africa-Womanismus: as we reconquer ourselves) speaks of the fact that we can defend ourselves in this way, in which they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, emotional, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped, which make up the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists are immediately calling separatism and exclusion after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment, I can raise black women and women of other cultures because in this paradigm I exist.</seg>

<seg id="2482">A police commissioner told Ada BÃ¡ez that she could not do anything against Luis Balbuena, her ex-husband, who had become violent against her.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of their relationship, some time has gone by and the police said that their statement would be laid to the files, but more could not be done.</seg>
<seg id="2484">As another Mrs. Balbuena pointed out for ill-treatment, Ada BÃ¡ez 'informed display did nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later, the second woman pulled her ad back.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">In general, if women give an ad at all, they generally do not receive support from the state.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, women are also financially dependent on the men they abuse. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be victims of violence must be reported to the law enforcement authorities at all.</seg>
<seg id="2489">Content 1 Batteries and statistic 2 Invisible maltreatment and a legal system that has nothing to do with Paraguays laws: good approach, lack of implementation impacts and statistics</seg>
<seg id="2490">It is difficult to determine how many women are really mistreated, says Myrian GonzÃ¡lez, researcher for gender issues at the Centro de DocumentaciÃ³n y Estudios, a research institution in Paraguay. "there are various information and reports that do not even show the extent of gender-specific violence against women in Paraguay," she explains.</seg>
<seg id="2491">However, the numbers available are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, the District Attorney Office filed 9600 advertisements for domestic violence. 70% of them were violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5,000 advertisements for domestic violence in the courts of peace. also here 86% of the ads were reported by women.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the adverts 40% of women said that they were physically abused, 55% of women spoke of mental abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">These statistics do not, however, show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the Paraguayan women's minister, Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually shown. "for every woman who is refunded in Paraguay for psychological abuse, 9 women who do not do this.</seg>
<seg id="2498">"" "" "" "for every woman who is reimbursed for physical abuse, two women who do not do this," "" "she declared at the end of 2014." ""</seg>
<seg id="2499">Since the murder of women in Paraguay is not a crime, the law enforcement agencies cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2500">By August 2016 alone, journalists included at least 12 cases of murder in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinator for human rights in Paraguay has documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to their estimates, in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies due to violence by men.</seg>

<seg id="2504">Invisible abuse and a judicial system that does not undermine anything</seg>
<seg id="2505">Before Mariana BrÃ­tez became the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she called him the names of all her former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In the beginning she didn't want it, but then gave up. this should be regretted forever.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and no longer met with Carlos. but for two years she endured psychic violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult one:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought I would once have been a victim of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read about it earlier, I always thought that it only happened to women who are too subservient, because they are fooled by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report abuses by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without naming names, she wrote articles on Facebook where she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told how he had isolated her.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their contributions, among them Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically whether he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why she had fallen from Carlos for so long and did not leave him earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as if they wanted to say that the victims of abuse had at least some kind of complicity in it.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, who does not come from Paraguay, fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner was abusing her.</seg>
<seg id="2517">"" "Victoria is a member of the Yo te Creo network (" "" "I believe to you" "" ") consisting of women who are all victims of abuse." ""</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not: they take the women's statements seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias, everything started with mental abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her wealthy partner eventually even managed to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victorias ads with the authorities remained without result and also from their relatives, she received no support.</seg>
<seg id="2524">She led a trial against her former partner, who developed into an impenetrable legal struggle between Paraguay and her home country, where it was mainly about money, power, and the influence of her former partner.</seg>

<seg id="2528">Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN organisation for women in Paraguay, also sees major problems in the application of laws in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2529">On 10 August 2016, a draft law was debated at the Paraguayan parliament, which was known under the hashtag # Porelas (# for you).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the # NiUnaMinos movement (# non-Less) are part of a campaign on Twitter which is supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original draft of the law proposes that Feminid would declare to be an independent criminal offense and punish it harder than it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Thus the law text was modified in some points in order to also win the deputies for the law, which feared that the path for decriminalisation of abortions would be levelled, which is currently prohibited in Paraguay and be penalised with up to five years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The original bill was intended to cost the majority of the (bureaucratic and economic) process costs which the victims of violence currently have to bear, if they just want to reimburse ad and get a secure accommodation to the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient financial resources for it:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay, abuse is seen as part of interpersonal relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Here a rethinking of violence must take place so that violence is no longer regarded as something normal.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Those who remain silent in the face of these facts are complicit and contribute to the perpetrators being punished.</seg>
<seg id="2538">"" "" "" "we must reimburse for such a long time until maltreatment is no longer considered normal." ""</seg>
<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the law was passed in the Paraguayan Senate. prior to that, parts of the law were changed, among other things a passage that the partners called for reconciliation in cases of domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The opinions on the changes are going to be different.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The Section for Reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggressor to attack its victim again.</seg>
<seg id="2542">The cancellation of the words "gender," "political force" and "sexual harassment" from parts of the law however is considered to be a great setback.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, picture takes place with his consent</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media. it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need for medical research performed on site: on the one hand, many medicines and vaccines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent are lacking in the offer of global healthcare.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases like AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more serious effects in Africa's poorest countries than elsewhere, and lack of investment for research on these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Second, the research carried out by African researchers helps to build own research capacities in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of the Central Laboratory at the Center for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in Lusaka, Zambia in the 1990s, when the AIDS epidemic showed first serious implications for national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he himself researched the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the SÃ¡mi health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about misunderstandings of the media about this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(disclaimer: Dr. Warrier is a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work lies on the application of research results. I support the SÃ¡mi National Programme for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">In addition, I am currently starting a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">What do you think are the most important current science topics in your country and in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">That has to change, otherwise we will always be recipients, rather than being a mover.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions we get are often not very usable in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here.</seg>

<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are funded differently.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries.</seg>

<seg id="2613">What are the obstacles in your routine research work you didn't have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">What is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there is interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GM: what is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should it focus on, and how can we support the development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>

<seg id="2622">There is need for special scientific training starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, big data, space exploration, healthcare (non-communicable and infectious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GM: can you describe the pros and cons of life as a scientist in Africa compared to Western countries, based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often, it is the limited speed to do things, and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here.</seg>

<seg id="2628">This article from Rachel Cernansky was originally published on Ensia.com's website, a magazine that reports on solutions for environmental problems around the world.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding in the USA for the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 types of, such as Outright Gorgeous, the first plant that has been cultivated and consumed by NASA astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years, Morton's work was limited only by his own ingenuity and the question of how many sorts of lettuce he can get.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000s he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use them any further for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents not only gold for individual varieties, but also for specific properties such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green or chewed leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past few years, more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants, such as cereal or carrot species. due to this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts are concerned about food security for the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia old tradition, Morton still cultivates lettuce, but he now needs longer because his work is increasingly complicated by more and more restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it's like a boulder in a river, around which I have to paddle." ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">"" "so we have to do that now, but it's a break with the breeding tradition," "" "he says." "" "I think these patents go far too far." ""</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stand before judgment, no one can breed a new type of salad, because all the features are already patented. "so he continues to do as good as possible and tries to breed the characteristics that he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, he is very cautious and endeavours to not use any material that is protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He has also joined a movement that gets bigger and bigger in the US and all over the world: open Source Breeding ("Open Source").</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and tasted red Roman salat of the Outsharks variety at the "greenhouse" of the station. there it is tested whether plants can be cultivated in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name may sound more like the movement from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for "open source" seeds) is inspired by the free "open source" software movement that provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was launched to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and thus can be used permanently for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative, briefly called Ossi, US farmers can commit themselves to the fact that others can freely use the seeds they have bred.</seg>
<seg id="2647">This does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it. "open Source" breeders only allow others to breed their seeds in order to breed their own varieties, and not to cut it immediately - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant patents.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">Professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi board member Jack Kloppenburg has control of the seed and the possibility to breed new plants, both important for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">According to him, seed plays a role in greater contexts such as biodiversity, farmers' rights, control over the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding sowing seeds with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">"" "Kloppenburg emphasizes that the" "" "open source" "" "movement is not concerned with genetically modified plants." ""</seg>
<seg id="2653">All types of plants could be patented whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from organic farming or not. "in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over the seed, the most recent examples are the mergers of ChemChina and Syngenta and Bayer." who wants to buy good, locally and sustainably produced vegetables, should also know that the way this vegetables is bred is threatened.</seg>
<seg id="2654">"" "" "" "food sovereignty without food sovereignty is not possible." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to making their seeds available to others. their approach is, in contrast, to patent seed and plant characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo of Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk, as the available gene pool is constantly shrinking due to the ever increasing intellectual property rights on plant material, which is therefore increasingly restricted.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, executive director Ossi, employed in her PhD thesis with a genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about a third of all the antitrust features are protected as intellectual property, making it suitable for plant breeders either at all or only difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2659">There are still no such estimates for other plants, but experts like Luby suggest that massive grown plants such as wheat are patented in even greater style than lettuce or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are grown in such a way that they have specifically desired characteristics - from those by which their taste or colour improves to those, due to which they thrive in certain environments and withstand threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patenting on plant properties suggest that the available plant material for breeders is taking more and more patents. genetic diversity is far more difficult than ever before, because changing conditions due to climate change are far worse predictable.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto spokesperson Carly Scaduto acknowledges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the United States Department of Agriculture, the company is committed to maintaining genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It contradicts the notion that intellectual property installs other breeders, as "patents and the protection of plant varietties promote innovation." a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent has expired.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to get to the same result with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Such protection does not inhibit innovations, but encourages them by making more material and know-how available to the public. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton looks the other way: waiting for 20 years until a patent expires, certainly does not promote innovation.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait so long to grow crops, which are adapted to the changed environmental conditions, you would have already lost the battle.</seg>
<seg id="2669">"" "but Morton's main argument is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should continue to stay:" "" "independent plant breeders do not have time or money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us." ""</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "this is what drives us and it becomes impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and newest genetic resources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">"" "overall, Morton interferes with the concept of patenting plant-characteristics:" "" "we do not really create the characteristics themselves." ""</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form them themselves and as breeders we finally have no idea how the plants do that.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeding breeder in the US state Oregon and Ossi-Member of the Management Board, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "who breeds one type, also breeds its own values in it.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Anyone who believes in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, for whose cultivation is required mass herbicides, breeds this concept of agriculture in its varieties.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "my concept is perfectly contrary." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (such that are moving on international markets but are smaller than Monsanto), they manage most small seed companies to survive even without patents - either they reject the patent or they think it is too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case.</seg>

<seg id="2690">In October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos organized a conference on "Open Source" seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa came together to learn something about the "open source" seed movement and the worldwide trend towards patenting seed.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos' program for "open source" seed systems, explains that the organization is currently building a global alliance for "open source" seed systems for which the official starting signal should be scheduled next year.</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organisation and blog are the latest aims of censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">The Egyptian authorities still jail content on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time, it was the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend around the 5th of August, the Egyptian government closed the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI) which documents human rights abuses in Egypt and the Arab world and reports on the same.</seg>
<seg id="2724">"" "" "" "in August, the network published an opinion on Facebook, in which it criticised the Egyptian authorities for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region." ""</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains true to its objective, to defend the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world, to defuse the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world, so it has never been as important as it is now.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered the first censored website of a human rights organization in Egypt, after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago, as for example the independent news site Mada Masr, Arab-speaking issue of the Huffington Post and the Qatar derived network of Al Jazeera due to alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organisation of wave of website barriers to victims. @ anhri one of the main sources of human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">Besides ANHRI, the blog of columnist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada has no access to Egypt anymore.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada used his blog for spreading columns and articles that he writes for in Egypt non-accessible websites and media.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog he set up to circumvent the censorship of the Egyptian government, even the goal of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Bloggers, the provider in which also adas blog is home, however, is further accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, reporting on the student protests and taking a video as police practised physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles mainly revolve around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada commented on the government's blocking and reflected what it means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">Blocking blogs is very old but has priority in the era of AbdelFattah al-Sisi; and even if the blocking of blogs may not be significant for the world, it is for two reasons for me:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) They managed to convey to me the feeling of a state of siege; an arrest, attempted murder, summons to the National Security Council, blocking blogs and any other website for which I was working.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) They proved that I did not write in vain. in other words, my words have an influence, even if only a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First I used it to post items to bypass the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">But now, after they have locked him and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The brave leave the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte) Egyptian authorities closed off from May 24th to June 6th, 133 web pages. this resulted in technical tests in networks of different Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">Afte also documented the blockage of vendors, which was possible by embracing internet censorship and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">Afte reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12th we noticed how the blocking of web pages that VPNs offer began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such a practice points to the government's intention to continue to block and filter content that Egyptian users could have access.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The situation is also worsened by the fact that the censorship decisions are taken behind closed doors, which means that the Egyptian population has no legal basis, with which it can proceed against these acts in court.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with censorship and who will it attack next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in the war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants argue.</seg>

<seg id="2753">Day after day newspapers in whole Brazil report with gloomy headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motives.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"" "" "" "14-year-old shot in school" "", "" "" "A police officer in Rio de Janeiro" "", "" "" "Thieves robbed pharmacies with military weapons," "" "President Timer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, navy and air tea to Rio." ""</seg>
<seg id="2756">In the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, the wave of violence in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organization Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become everyday and this is unacceptable & # 8212; find at least the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">On 16 August, the editorial "Extra" published for the detailed reporting on violence in Rio published the editorial "This is not normal" in which it announced a new section called "War in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports on violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The motives for her decision explained the newspaper so:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report about crimes that happen in every major city in the world like murder, robbery, sexual crimes, etc. all that is deviating from the civilized standard and what happens only in Rio will be published in the section "War in Rio." (...) This is our way to call: it is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">"" "" "" "this is the only alternative that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cruelty." ""</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four minute video shared on Facebook, OctÃ¡vio Guedes, editor-in-chief of the newspaper, declared that this decision was not an occasion for pride, but rather a sign of failure.</seg>
<seg id="2765">It is probably the only newspaper worldwide with a war-martial in a country that does not recognize the war at all.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist explains that according to the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 843 territories that are controlled by criminal organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial, the newspaper continues:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war discourse, when it is distorted, can also be used to obscure the atrocities of the police, who only shoots and then asks questions.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police, whose goal is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">"" "does the term" "" "war" "" "harm more than they use?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal, The Intercept Brasil, journalist CecÃ­lia Oliveira is arguing against calling the violence as a "war." in their opinion, this is a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to punish those responsible for the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and poor planning - as demonstrated in the analysis of military operations in Rio, in combination with inadequate investments in personnel, education and historical and self-complacent carelessly.</seg>
<seg id="2774">In memory: the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2776">Photo by: Fernando FrazÃ£o / AgÃªncia Brasil. publication with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="2777">Calling Rio de Janeiro as "the most violent place in Brazil" is wrong according to CecÃ­lia: "22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 in the north and northeast of the country. these are the latest available data.</seg>
<seg id="2778">None of these cities are located in the state of Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="2779">"" "when we look at the mores per state, Rio is on number 16," "" "she writes." ""</seg>
<seg id="2780">Extra belongs to the company Globo, the largest media company in South America, which, as CecÃ­lia stresses, has repeatedly repealed the state's security policy for years.</seg>
<seg id="2781">These security policy measures included the establishment of the UPP (Unidade de PolÃ­cia Pacificadora), a police unit set up by the state of Rio in 2003, whose aim is to capture favela by deploying a massive police ban and permanently stationing a unit there.</seg>
<seg id="2782">In the beginning, this actually led to a decrease of violent death cases. but after several years, the UPP has increasingly been under fire after several reports of harassment and repressions against poor communities, which should actually protect the newly created police unit.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, journalist JoÃ£o Paulo Charleaux from one of his articles dating back to 2010 explains why violence in Rio does not comply with the criteria set out by the Geneva Convention on the term "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also involves serious consequences for the people.</seg>
<seg id="2786">This calls for the state to use means and means typical of war. this includes penetration into the territory of a "enemy," in which a civilian is a sharp point in the landscape and becomes the object of "collateral damage" and "lost balls."</seg>
<seg id="2787">War back or forth, fact is that the inhabitants of the favelas continue to suffer in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="2788">A week ago, the police cleared the mountain with the favela Jacarezinho to avenge the death of a policeman.</seg>
<seg id="2789">In the midst of all this violence, this incident also made headlines: a fruit salesman died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2807">Due to the many years of blockade traditional foods such as meat have become unattainable for large parts of the population.</seg>
<seg id="2808">As a counter-measure, a group of Syrian humanitarian workers and academics will teach the inhabitants of East Ghoutas, how they can plant their own mushrooms as "food-saving food source."</seg>

<seg id="2810">Mushrooms are not among the common foods planted in Syria and are very rare in the Syrian cuisine. however, their food makes them an attractive source of food for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta.</seg>

<seg id="2833">Several hundred people protested on 21 October in many district capitals in Portugal, demanding justice for the victims of fires that were rampaging in the north of Portugal in the week before.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October. this led to the government calling for a state shower last week from solidarity with the victims for three days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Fires were also registered in the Galicia region in Spain, where there were 4 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there were more than 500 refractory outbreaks that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages.</seg>
<seg id="2837">In June, a similar tragedy occurred in PedrÃ³gÃ£o Grande, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured by the fires.</seg>
<seg id="2838">According to the European forest surveillance system, which monitors forest areas via satellite images, around 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district.</seg>

<seg id="2875">Exactly at that time, Ashara Barati, a 13-year-old boy, joined the ethnic group of the Hazara, in the province of Ghazni in Central Afghanistan for the last time together with his family at dinner.</seg>
<seg id="2876">Even though his mother didn't say that at that time, she knew she would no longer see her son again - maybe never again.</seg>
<seg id="2877">In the morning, the boy should break open.</seg>
<seg id="2878">His uncle would pick him up and bring him to the tugs.</seg>

<seg id="2884">Abdul Ali Mazari, leader of the Hezb-e-Wahdat party dominated by Hazara, had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Hazara suddenly felt defenceless.</seg>
<seg id="2885">The Taliban, known for their hatred for the Hazara, came closer and closer.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">A few days after his escape, Ashara found himself in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a coal mine. the work was heavy and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Once again, he found himself in a foreign country along with other refugees and sluggish sacks with mortar that were heavier than himself, in order to earn his livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="2890">Back then, like today, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was marked by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"" "" "" "it was really hard," "" "remembers in an interview with Global Voices." "" "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the construction site on which we also worked." ""</seg>
<seg id="2892">There were no services and no heating there. we hung nylon in front of the open windows so that we were not freezing at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Ashara left his life without papers in Iran and made herself ready for the journey to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous passage on the sea he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small uninhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected his asylum request, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">For some time, Asharaf was homeless, running alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks, and went to a church that distributed food to needy people twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers due to relatively high initial ratings. it is true, however, that the conditions that asylum seekers find in the country are catastrophic.</seg>
<seg id="2898">The human rights organisation Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes that "the system" suffers from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">"" "the vast majority of asylum seekers are housed in the more than 3000" "" "special reception centres." "" "these are improvised structures in the hands of unqualified and unqualified personnel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to Italian law, asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre, if they officially filed an application for asylum - which may go for months after the application of the asylum application.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who have no money for accommodation can either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">Thus did Asharaf also.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his irrepressible livelihood helped Asharpen to get rid of these conditions soon.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After he had made various works in the construction industry for several years, Ashark put his entire savings into the founding of a hostel in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a quick snack.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Ashara Baratis success story is now subject of the documentary "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (German: "behind Venice luxury - an Hazara in Italy") by director Amin Wahidi.</seg>
<seg id="2907">The film won the Venice City Award for the 24th time in 2017.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Much bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to inofficial estimates, about 20,000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them, the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years, some of the companies operated by Afghans have emerged, including tailors, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience, where the waiters and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The menu of the restaurant relates the history of their journey to Italy through the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek dishes.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened the restaurant Peace & amp; Spice and also behind the pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna and a sushi restaurant in Rome are also Afghans.</seg>
<seg id="2920">However, Asharafs's goals range far beyond the Italian hospitality industry and retail and aim back to the country which he had forced to leave as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"" "" "" "where there is a risk, there are possibilities," "" "says Asharaf with a smile." "" "I want to invest in Afghanistan." ""</seg>
<seg id="2922">I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily if I know my people suffer.</seg>
<seg id="2923">I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country, especially for women.</seg>
<seg id="2924">They represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as everyone else. "</seg>
<seg id="2925">"" "Asharaf also makes plans for opening a factory in Kabul, where people can learn packaging and preservation techniques." "" "so they can sell their crop surplus on the market and improve their financial situation," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2926">The development of the successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt, but in the end, stability and prosperity are.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Asharpen made this journey himself. now he would like to help other Afghans along the way.</seg>

<seg id="2929">He reported on the clearance of the camp Raba'a el Adaweya in Cairo, which protested against the overthrow of President Mohamed Morsi.</seg>

<seg id="2931">Global Voices Advocacys Netizen Report is an international snapshot, showing challenges, victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights</seg>
<seg id="2932">The Egyptian parliament has reviewed a draft bill that foresees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registering with a government authority.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Users would have to register to use social networks within six months of receiving their full name as well as their ID number.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Those who miss this step could be sentenced to six months' imprisonment or the extribution of a penalty.</seg>
<seg id="2935">The law, which was promoted by sixty members of parliament, is currently ahead of the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be debated there.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"" "" "" "another MP filed a legislative proposal in May which would introduce tougher penalties for the insult of president or high officials." ""</seg>
<seg id="2937">Under the law of Egypt, the insulting of the president and state institutions is already punishable. under the legislative proposal, such a crime would, however, be punished with prison and fines, as legal experts of Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy.</seg>
<seg id="2938">If the law is passed, this may mean up to three years imprisonment for the convicted.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"" "" "" "moreover, this would underpin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger for many years." ""</seg>
<seg id="2940">A striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he took photos of violence against demonstrators who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the removal of the elected President Mohammed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2941">Shawkan was waiting, more than 700 protest participants who had been arrested during the same incident, four years in jail for a trial date.</seg>
<seg id="2942">Recently, his trial was postponed to 20 May, because according to human rights groups, the prison management failed to bring the accused from prison to the courtroom.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Shawkan is threatening the death penalty due to one, so many human rights groups agree, headings of inter alia weapons possession, illegal assembly, murder and attempted murder.</seg>
<seg id="2944">In another case, a Criminal Court in Giza spoke the two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosad Al-Barbary. they were indicted for their reporting to the pro-Morsi session blockade on the Raba'a al-Adawiya square in Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="2945">The Court also reduced the punishment of journalists Abdullah al-Fakharany, Samhi Mustafa and Mohamed al-Adly, who were also arrested during the pre-event, from 25 years to 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Tunisian activist listens to scanned documents</seg>
<seg id="2947">In May, Tunisian authorities spent six hours interrogating Sami Ben Gharbia, who is co-founder of the independent media platform Nawaat and the Global Voices Advocacy Project.</seg>
<seg id="2948">Ben Gharbia was mainly interrogated with an action plan. said Plan stems from the President of the Republic, who, according to the plan, expressly assists a controversial draft bill that would guarantee businessmen and former regime by dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of corruption, provided they return all illegally received funds.</seg>
<seg id="2949">The document published on April 21 on the Nawaat website sheds light on how the pressidian plans for support of the legislation look like.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Ben Gharbia refused to mention his sources stating Article 11 of the Tunisian Press Committee stating that journalists are entitled to protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Nevertheless, he appeared as a witness in the Tunis District Court on 9 May.</seg>
<seg id="2952">Does China want to force the users of social media to present their identification?</seg>
<seg id="2953">According to new regulations by the State Council of the People's Republic of China, the users of social media require permission before writing or sharing messages in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2954">In addition, in the regulations it is stated that registration with full real name will be required.</seg>
<seg id="2955">Analysts believe that the elimination of anonymous comments in conversations within social networks is to be achieved. it is up to now unclear how the authorities will apply these rules.</seg>
<seg id="2956">Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to assert these rules only selectively in order to protect citizen journalism and independence.</seg>
<seg id="2957">"" "then do we see ourselves in" "" "WeChat" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2958">Not in Russia!</seg>
<seg id="2959">The censorship of Russia blocked the access to the latest Chinese messaging app WeChat.</seg>
<seg id="2960">"" "according to Roskomnadzor, WeChat sent to register as the" "" "Organisator of Information Diffusion" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2961">This designation is part of a 2014 law, thanks to which the Russian government holds a list of online services that organize the "publication of the information." the law also allows the government to make said services for removing content and to force it upon request for the delivery of user data.</seg>
<seg id="2962">These websites are currently Websites such as Vkontakte and Odnoclasnki (Russia's two most popular social networks), the Image Board 2.ch.hk, the email service mail.ru and dozens of other services.</seg>

<seg id="2964">A Turkish court decreed the Wikipedias in Turkey, since Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English-language articles, the information that Turkey supports the jihadists in Syria.</seg>

<seg id="2968">After this week, the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation on increased surveillance powers that would force Internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and install Backdoor programs that decrypt data encryption.</seg>
<seg id="2969">The government has consulted telecommunications companies and intelligence services regarding the proposal, but has provided other technology companies and civilian populations abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Despite all this, the consultation continues until May 19. reactions and proposals by members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior.</seg>
