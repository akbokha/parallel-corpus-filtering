this is James Ris@@ en .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times re@@ porter .
long before someone had heard Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ularly that the N@@ SA had illeg@@ ally listened to teleph@@ ones by Americans .
but there is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
in this he described a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation in which the CIA literally handed over designs to Iran for a nuclear bomb .
if that sounds crazy , read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who didn &apos;t like the chapter ?
the U.S. government .
for almost 10 years the government has been fighting against Ris@@ en and called upon him to call his alleged sources .
in this train , he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern to condemn whist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers and spy on journalists .
according to the First Constitutional Court , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right if media do not receive this information and if they cannot protect identity of the courageous they are revealing .
so when the government kno@@ cked at Ris@@ en , he did something many courageous re@@ porters did before him : he refused and said he &apos;d rather go to jail .
from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en lived with the risk of going to jail .
but then , just days before the process , something exceptional happened .
suddenly , although they had years stated that it would be essential to their case , the demands of the government were dropped by ri@@ fts .
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring , the re@@ porters and sources can always hide less .
instead of failing and spl@@ itting tears to the asser@@ tion , this could also do his digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , kept his telephone records secretly ,
just like his email data , financial and bank information , credit ratings , and even travel tips with the list of his flights .
in the midst of this information , they found evidence they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA whist@@ leb@@ lower and ri@@ ghtful source .
unfortunately this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect whist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers in his attempt to protect whist@@ le @-@ blo@@ wers . but instead , the judi@@ ci@@ ary has condemned more than all US governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of its work as a secret .
since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of a whist@@ leb@@ lower to a journalist .
so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional complaint , because the government has more and more options to spy on all .
but just like the government &apos;s technology allows the government to circum@@ vent the rights of re@@ porters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources .
and they can do that from the moment they contact , rather than in retro@@ sp@@ ect , in the witness stand .
today there is communication software that didn &apos;t exist when spl@@ its had written its book , and it is much safer than normal emails or phone calls .
such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source distribution system for whist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , which was originally developed by the Internet world famous Aaron Swar@@ tz , and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation , in which I work .
instead of sending an email , go to a news website like the one here of the Washington Post .
there you can upload documents or send information as usual with any contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server at which only the respective news agency has access .
so the government can no longer obtain information secretly , and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset .
however , Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect freedom of the press in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new spy technologies that thre@@ aten us all .
it is important to us to ensure that not only technology gather@@ ers such as Edward Snow@@ den have a way to off@@ end wrong@@ doing . it is just as important that we protect the next whist@@ leb@@ lower ,
who knows about ab@@ uses in the supply of soldiers and wants to report from crowded hospitals . or the next environmental colleague who al@@ erts the alarm to the contaminated water from F@@ lin@@ t . or a wall street insi@@ ders who warns us before the next financial crisis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes but to protect our all constitutional rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you .
&#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; This week we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; This week we were asked by news of a le@@ ak of 11 million documents of the Panama @-@ based law firm Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a .
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers are going to companies like Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; okay , we need an anonymous enterprise . can you set up this ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we actually see the e @-@ mails , the exchange of messages as the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to very first very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s prime minister has res@@ ig@@ ned .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad has brief@@ case firms in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
it is claimed that a track of $ 2 billion will lead to Russian President Vladimir Putin , a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cel@@ list .
now there will be a lot of ri@@ cher people out there and others who are anxious to wait for the next release , and on the next revealed documents .
now it sounds like the plot of an agency writer or a John Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
it seems to be crying out from you , to me , ordinary people .
why should we do that ?
but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not all their taxes pay , this means less money for important public services such as healthcare , education , roads .
and that concerns us all .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenom@@ enal .
throughout the world , media and leading politicians are discussing how secret ha@@ v@@ ens are used by a few to hide and disgu@@ ise their assets -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years .
I think many people all over the world seem very conf@@ using , and it &apos;s hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work .
I always present it like a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these issues .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think it &apos;s also interesting that there are less reports about this matter in the USA .
presumably because there have so far been no prominent Americans who in these revelations came to this sc@@ andal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is not that there are no rich Americans who are hiding their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but by the principle that these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers .
if we had a data le@@ ak from the Cay@@ man Islands , or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the US .
in fact , in some US states you need less information , need less information to found a company than to get a library card .
this kind of in@@ transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children .
it has allowed sc@@ amm@@ ers to rip off particularly vulnerable investors .
it is this kind of behavior that affects all of us .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice .
how does it actually work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator came out as a African minister who wanted to bring susp@@ icious money to the United States to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really shocked all of us that all except one lawyer asked our investig@@ ators how he could transfer his money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course nobody was given money to anybody . however , it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important not to consider this as an individual case .
it is not about a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our cover@@ t investig@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not about a single top politi@@ cian , wrapped up in a sc@@ andal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about how the system works , through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability .
and in order to cope with this , we have to change the rules of the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to change the rules to make this kind of behaviour more difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that may sound very tri@@ vial as if we could not do anything about it ; as if nothing ever had changed ; as if there will always be the rich and powerful .
but as a born optim@@ ist I see quite well that some things have started to change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few years we have seen violations of more transparency concerning the owners of companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the topic took political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , the EU has gathered in central registers at national level , who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the USA lag@@ s behind .
representatives of both parties have submitted a bill to the bill in both parliamentary groups , but this does not make the progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how these Panama Dis@@ closure , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and global .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment of change .
we need ordinary people who will be angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind bog@@ us companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need leaders in the economy to stand up and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognise the problem and use laws to end this kind of in@@ transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together we can finally end the in@@ transparency which is now enabling this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the story of how I almost kidn@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das .
one day after completing my design studies , I made a sale of post@@ age .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stopped and looked at my things .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road trip across the country . then he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he excit@@ edly told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I thought , &quot; Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans it . I don &apos;t want to land in the trunk of a Maz@@ das !
this is a small boot !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; u@@ h , please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at night I was lying in bed , I star@@ ed at the blanket and thought , &quot; Oh man ! what caused me to rock ?
a wild stranger sleeps in my living room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what if he is crazy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I got such a fear that I went out of bed , sle@@ ek at ten tips on the door , and shut my bedroom door shut .
but he was not crazy at all .
we are still in touch .
the work of art that he had bought from me today hangs in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it completely changed my point of view .
perhaps the people who were sold to me as strangers in childhood were actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered ?
being on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco I took the air mattress with me .
let &apos;s take a time leap , two years later ...
I &apos;m unemployed , almost broke , my room@@ mate withdraw@@ s and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all the hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can make it easier to transform fear into fun .
I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could make something to do . our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk , including a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and founded so &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; AI@@ R@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three lucky guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wood floors .
they found it great , and we too .
I &apos;m sure our cheese @-@ ham om@@ el@@ ets ta@@ sted differently because we made them for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them all over the city . when we bid our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Brian and I star@@ ed .
had we just discovered that we were able to find new friends at the same time and were able to pay our rent ?
things came rolling .
my former fellow @-@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ ek@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if we could make a business concept from it .
so we presented to investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people publish pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of room whose doors are closed when visiting .
over the Internet , they can then invite other strangers to stay with them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that will be the next great thing ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we waited for the missi@@ le to ign@@ ite .
but they do not .
nobody who is still in sol@@ ace would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous .
when you have a problem , you concentrate on things that you can do well . we could design .
at the Academy of Arts , we learned that design is much more than just appearance and feel -- it is the total experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust through design , among people who had never met before .
can design make such a thing ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a taste of which degree of trust we are striving for .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I would like you to unlock your mobile phone .
give your locked mobile phone to your left sitting room@@ mate .
this quiet touch of panic , which you feel now -- is exactly what hosts feel when opening the door for the first time .
because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands ?
most people feel the responsibility .
this way , most guests also feel when they stay elsewhere .
only for this reason can our company exist .
just like that , who actually has Al Gor@@ es mobile phone now ?
could you please announce on Twitter that he is candidates for the office of the President ?
you can now return the cell phones now .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I would like to share with you some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail on this experiment ?
what if your neighbor had first presented himself with his name , if he had told where he came from , like his dog or his children ?
imagine you have 150 jud@@ gements , which all say : &quot; he can really hold on very well sprung hands ! &quot;
how would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone ?
a well thought @-@ out feedback system strengthens confidence .
in the beginning we did some things wrong .
it was hard for people to give negative jud@@ gements .
finally , we decided to wait until both host and guest had left their assessments before we put them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we investigated how likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how much they are regarding age and place of residence .
not surprisingly , we trust the most similar to the people who are most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social bias .
it becomes exciting when you add a person &apos;s call -- in our case by assessments .
if you have less than three jud@@ gements , nothing changes .
but if you have more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation stems from simil@@ arities .
the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted think@@ ers .
in addition , we learned that trust is dependent on how much you buy from yourself .
here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you tell too little , for example &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hi ! , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you get no answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you tell too much , for example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother -- -- &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- the request is not accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so there &apos;s an optimal degree of openness , for example &quot; Tol@@ le works of art in your apartment ! I go on vacation with my family . &quot;
how can we create it with design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which subjects to write something .
our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudi@@ ces against foreigners .
what we had not reck@@ oned with was the great deal of people who were more than willing to disp@@ lace these prejudi@@ ces .
here you see how many people claim our offer .
you can recognize three things .
first : incredibly good luck .
second , the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
thir@@ dly , a need that hadn &apos;t been met before .
for us business is going very well .
of course , there are times when not everything runs smoothly .
there were guests who have not allowed parties to celebrate parties or have devast@@ ated apartments .
hosts have let guests stand in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked in the customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the forefront when trust broke .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts when I only think of it .
the dis@@ appointment that you hear in the voice of the c@@ aller was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve ourselves .
fortunately , the 123 million over@@ nights spent only a fraction of a problem .
for people were tru@@ sting each other rightly .
when trust works , there can be wonderful things .
one of our guests made holiday in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary surgery !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect home for travelers who are prone to heart attacks due to se@@ d@@ entary activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with adequate hospitals .
J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels who save lives , even though they don &apos;t know one at all .
you drive one in your own car to the hospital , when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want one to feel lonely , they bring books by .
they can even stay longer without calculating the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
so , of course , not every stay exp@@ ires .
but these relations behind the pure money transaction are just what you want to achieve with the share economy .
when I first stum@@ bled over this term , I asked myself :
how does the idea of sharing work with money transactions ?
it is a matter of economic trading .
but to call it &quot; rental industry , &quot; the thing is not justified .
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people place a part of themselves open , and that changes everything .
when you travel today , you can compare it with Fast Food . it &apos;s efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
what would , however , be if journeys were a rich buffet made of local impressions ?
what if in any place one visits , a group there would wait there to fill a thoroughly and show a quarter of a pub craw@@ led by which one has never heard before ;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays apartments are designed according to the principles of privacy .
what if we were to create apartments from scratch to each other ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would accept the thought of shared sharing ?
I imagine cities that allow us society and relations instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and isolation .
this project has already begun in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul . many parking lots belonging to the government ,
were now offered residents . students looking for a place to stay ,
were conveyed to people whose children were being moved out . incub@@ ator programs were started ,
in order to be able to finance new start @-@ ups in the share economy . on our platform alone , 7@@ 85@@ ,000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a stranger or even host .
so the idea doesn &apos;t seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us .
we didn &apos;t re@@ inv@@ ent the wheel .
hospitality was already there before .
there were similar websites ahead of us .
so why did our work just work ?
apart from luck and timing , we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust .
design can help us overcome deeply rooted prejudi@@ ces .
I find it start@@ ling ,
down@@ right overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Maz@@ da goes by .
we know , of course , that design cannot solve every problem .
but if it could help us , if it had such a big impact , I wonder why we can use design soon .
thank you .
what do you think when you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
perhaps even a sister .
or oppressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ?
or simply a delay in the airport security check .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t blame you for your negative impressions .
so the media represent people who look like me .
a study found that 80 % of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show : the Americans think most would not know Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
for those who have never met a Muslim : it &apos;s great to get to know you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double es@@ pres@@ so , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a se@@ ag@@ ull @-@ fitness fan@@ atic ,
and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim .
but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not born this way .
I decided to do so .
when I was 17 years old , I made the decision to ou@@ ten myself .
no , not as a hom@@ os@@ exual person , like some of my friends , but as Muslims . I decided to wear my head cover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my femin@@ ist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the funny thing was : at that time it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence for me , vis @-@ à @-@ vis the pressure I felt as a 17 year old , to adapt myself to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal .
I have not only pas@@ sively accepted the faith of my parents .
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the Qur &apos;an .
I read it , thought , asked , doub@@ ted and ultimately believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow dedication , deep@@ ening with every reading of the Qur &apos;an .
the beauty of rhythm sometimes makes me cry .
I recognize myself in it . I feel God knows me .
did you ever feel that someone you perc@@ ei@@ ves you fully understands , and yet loves ?
that &apos;s how it feels .
later I married and started , like all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineer .
later , after my marriage , I had a child , and basically lived the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream . &quot;
then came that terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breaking News &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was smoke , air@@ planes flew into buildings , humans jump@@ ed out of the buildings .
what was that ?
to have an accident ?
a technical failure ?
my shock rapidly turned into rebellion .
why should we do such a thing ?
I switched to the television channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; Ne@@ ar East origin ... &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Ji@@ had ... &quot; ... &quot; bom@@ bed Mec@@ ca ! &quot;
Oh my god .
not only has my country been attacked , but in the N@@ u the actions of others turned me into susp@@ ects of others .
on the same day , we had to travel through the Mid@@ west of the USA to move into a new city and begin with the post@@ graduate studies .
I remember how I knew -- when we were silent -- as deep it went into my seat , and I was the first time I was to be recognized as Muslims .
we moved into our apartment this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be vig@@ il@@ ant &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be careful &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stay in well lit areas &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed inside the whole week .
then it was Friday that week -- the day Muslims gather for prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again the warnings watched , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I looked at the extensive coverage .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or from people that were considered Muslims , drag@@ ged and struck .
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who attacked this country attacked our country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have put the anger of the people on the terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly have to explain itself .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
it is the accus@@ ations that are hard .
today we can actually say people say : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- Muslims are called .
when will we release them ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and join mos@@ ques .
they talk about my church like a tumor in the body of the USA .
only the question arises : are we malign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
you know : a malign@@ ant tumour is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumour is only observed under observation .
the alternatives are meaning@@ less , because the question is false .
Muslims , like all other Americans , are not a tumour in the body of the United States , but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , first resp@@ onder@@ s and Olympi@@ ans .
will the closure of mos@@ ques make America safer ?
there might be some parking spaces , but not stopping the terror .
the regular visit of a mos@@ que leads to a more toler@@ ant view of people of other fai@@ ths , and to show greater citizen participation .
and as a head of the police in the Washington area , DC recently told me , people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques .
they are radic@@ alised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer .
in the process of radic@@ alisation , it has been found that he begins online . first , the person is cut off from their community , even by their family , so that the extrem@@ ist group can make a bra@@ in@@ washing that causes the person to be terrorists , and anyone who abh@@ ors their behaviour and their ideology is a tra@@ itor or fallen away from faith .
if we want to prevent radic@@ alisation , we have to stop people to go to the mos@@ que .
some will still claim Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Koran .
as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human being , I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would fit into their imag@@ inary world by acknowled@@ ging them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam , like the K@@ u Klu@@ x Cl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology in their &quot; holy book . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when you take a look at it , it does not drive on what they &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; read &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Scriptures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that allows them to read these things into Scripture .
an outstanding ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she had planned to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was exactly the opposite . every cl@@ ergy who spoke to them brought them to silence and told her that their anger , their sense of un@@ righteousness in the world , would bring them into trouble .
inspired by nothing and something that would make sense to their anger , it was a major goal for the instrument@@ alization by extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised a solution .
this ima@@ m restored the connection with God and its church .
instead of acc@@ using them for their anger , he showed their constructive ways for a real change in the world .
what she learned in the mos@@ que kept her from joining the IS .
this was an insight into how Islam@@ opho@@ bia and my family are concerned .
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , our freedom of thought ?
one study -- actually several neu@@ ros@@ ci@@ enti@@ fic studies -- show : if we fear , at least three things happen .
we rather accept an authorit@@ arian government system , con@@ formance and prejudi@@ ce .
a study shows that when individuals submit messages in which negative about Muslims have been reported , they rather agree military attacks on Muslim countries , as well as the circumc@@ ision of American Muslims &apos; rights .
this is not just an academic problem .
if you look at when the mood sw@@ elled against Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two electoral periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can indeed be a tool to manipul@@ ate the public to under@@ mine the fund@@ ament of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear hur@@ ts all of us .
when as@@ signing collective guilt it is not only about having to explain itself .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where they both went to school .
De@@ ah was a sports@@ man .
he was talented at the dental faculty , talented , promising ...
his sister would tell me he was the sweet@@ est , most generous person she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was st@@ un@@ ned and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when did I become such an accomplished young man from my little brother ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just a few weeks after Su@@ z@@ anne &apos;s visit to her brother and wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , murdered her , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was visiting in the afternoon .
he shot at De@@ ah eight times .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can be not only im@@ moral but also deadly .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mos@@ que or did we stay safe at home ?
we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about which America we want to leave to our children : one thing that would control us by fear , or one in which we can freely exercise our religion .
we decided for the mos@@ que .
with our son in the children &apos;s seat , we drove sil@@ ently , with high pressure to the mos@@ que .
I took him out , pulled off my shoes , went to the prayer hall , and what I saw made me stop .
the hall was rest@@ less .
then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , for half of the assembled congregation were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to assist us .
in that moment I have collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had taken courage and compassion to panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be safe on number ?
or will you join those who think that we are better than those .
thank you very much .
thank you very much !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I wonder what you say to those who might say you are holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a mind@@ set with drau@@ ght , working in a clas@@ sy mind@@ set , so an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , do not dec@@ eive you . I am perfectly normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as permitted .
if you look at the Muslims around the world , and I did that with the largest ever conducted study on Muslims around the world , people want normal things .
they want wealth for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I am no exception in any way .
when people seem like an exception to rule , then often the rule has been broken and they are not the exception to the rule .
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is about to become a multi @-@ billion dollar business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research institutions worldwide .
before air packing came into our social awareness , an autonomous fleet of flying machines in the F@@ RAC Centre in France built a six meter high tower out of 1 500 bricks in France . some years ago , they began to fly with ropes .
by connecting , air devices reach high speed and acceleration in confined spaces .
you can also set up self @-@ level@@ able structures .
they have learned to carry loads , deal with turbul@@ ence and generally react to laws of nature .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of possible in the autonomous flight .
in order for a system to function autonom@@ ously , it must collectively know where the mobile objects are located in the room .
in our laboratory at ETH Zürich we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demo@@ s we use a new localization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a publisher of our laboratory .
there are no external cameras .
each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , determine the calculations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external commands exist at the highest level e. g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Start &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear starter ,
a flight device trying to beat two flies with a flap .
like other start @-@ ups , it is efficient in the forward flight , much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations .
in contrast to most Star@@ r@@ flü@@ gl@@ ers it can float , and has big advantages in starting and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a down@@ side .
a restriction of rear @-@ star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ence like wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind this is that the flight device doesn &apos;t matter in which position the optimum position is recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing .
al@@ right .
during our research , we often face basic abstract questions that come to the heart of the matter .
one such question would be , for example , what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with thousands of moving parts that meet to hurt you .
decades ago , skilled pilots were able to fly remote @-@ controlled aircraft , which had only two movable parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder .
recently we discovered that flies work with only one .
this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically simplest remote @-@ operated flight device . it was invented recently .
it has only a moving part , a prop@@ eller ,
no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and cross rods , no further actuators or control surfaces , only a prop@@ eller .
although it is mechan@@ ically simple , the inner life happens very much so that it can fly stable and move anywhere in the room .
however , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the stern roller . to bring it to fly , I have to throw it exactly right .
the probability to really throw it right when all look at me is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed last night .
if the mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in car@@ el@@ essness , this machine is here , the omni@@ bus with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is only symmet@@ rical .
that is why it is ambi@@ valent in its orientation .
as a result , he receives the extraordinary ability ,
move in space in all directions , no matter what direction it is turned or even rot@@ ated .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers from the eight prop@@ ellers .
some can be seen in models , the rest is learned directly while flying .
let &apos;s look at it .
when flying machines are to be a part of our everyday life , they must become extremely safe and reliable .
this machine is made up of two separate two prop@@ ellers .
this rot@@ ates clock@@ wise
and the other anti @-@ clock@@ wise .
when you build them together , they behave like a high @-@ performance Quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
if something goes wrong -- an engine or prop@@ eller dies off , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can continue flying even if restricted .
we will demonstrate this now by making one half f@@ light@@ less .
the last demonstration will examine synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a pallet of aesthetic expression .
we took commercially available Micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where in the room it is and is self @-@ controlled . that is why there is no upper limit .
hopefully you will motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to re@@ think new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly secure machine as it is on Broadway would like to become a flying lamp shade on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology .
for types like us , wages are in development and creative act .
it serves as a reminder how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , smart creatures to form them in such a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive industrial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you very much .
1.3 billion years ago , two black holes orbit@@ ing in a very far distant galax@@ y cir@@ cl@@ ed each other faster , so the mass of three suns turned into pure energy in a tenth of a second .
this short moment they lit more bri@@ ghtly than all the stars together in all the galax@@ ies of the entire universe known to us .
it was a very big boy .
but they did not set their energy in the form of light --
finally we speak of black holes .
the whole energy was released into space @-@ time structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gravit@@ ational @-@ waves .
first , let &apos;s arrange the events in time .
it was 1.3 billion years ago that there was just a multi @-@ cel@@ esti@@ al life on Earth .
since then the earth has brought forth a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , humans and -- God is up to us -- even the internet .
about 25 years ago , a group of particularly courageous -- Ra@@ i Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver from Cal@@ tech - decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gravit@@ ational @-@ waves , which are caused by colli@@ ding black holes .
most of them were crazy .
but enough people recognized them as crazy geni@@ uses , so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea .
after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work they built the detector lig@@ o : the laser interfer@@ ometer gravit@@ ational @-@ waves @-@ observ@@ atory .
in the following period , the precision of Lig@@ o could be substantially increased , which greatly improved detection performance .
therefore it is called Advanced Lig@@ o .
at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a final test run in order to clarify some smaller , stub@@ born problems .
on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the start of the detector , the gravit@@ ational @-@ waves of the two colli@@ ding black holes crossed through the earth .
you went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the farewell to my death @-@ sick father .
basically they were the fruits of my life .
all that I had worked for is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has studied gravity waves from black holes for 23 years and their through observ@@ atories like lig@@ o meas@@ urable signals . but what are gravit@@ ational @-@ waves ?
a wave of gravit@@ ation is a cl@@ utter@@ ing in the structure of space and time .
when passing the shaft , the space and its entire contents are stretched in one direction and st@@ owed in the other direction .
in contempl@@ ation , lec@@ turers in courses of rel@@ ativity often lead a really al@@ ber@@ nal dance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stretch and dust , stretch and dust &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the problem is that gravit@@ ational @-@ waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous , are .
on September 14th , for example , everyone was stretched and st@@ owed by us when hitting the waves . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 .
this means 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . that is why the Lig@@ o staff was declared mad .
with a five kilometer long laser detector , and this is already absurd , this length would have to be measured to less than one thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of an atomic nucle@@ us . this is gr@@ ot@@ esque .
at the end of his classical text about gravity
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , described the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the technical difficulties in the construction of such det@@ ectors are enormous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public all obstacles will be overcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this in 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to say that Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I want to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavel@@ ength that is much smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your cell .
this is quite practical , because so you can customize a picture or a map of things by using the light coming from several points around you .
in the case of sounds , this is different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
that is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that particularly mean you :
the face of your child , for example .
instead we listen to certain qualities such as pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume in order to close the story behind it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now Alice is talking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and Bob interrup@@ ts her . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dum@@ b Bob . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to gravit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we cannot make simple pictures of objects in space with them .
but by looking at changes in the ampl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for Lig@@ o , the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range .
so when we convert wave patterns into sound , we can literally hear the universe speak .
to listen to the gravity , about the collision of two black holes can tell us about the collision with which my colleague Scott is already busy for a long time .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , simply chir@@ p : w@@ up@@ p !
if the two bodies rotate very quickly , you hear the same pair of p@@ ups with an additional key change . you can listen to the wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu
it is a kind of movement vocabulary , im@@ printed in the wa@@ ve@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date , which at least I will never forget , Lig@@ o heard the following : &#91; Sur@@ render &apos;s noise &#93; Som@@ e@@ one who knows what to listen to , detects this as a sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with a 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which rotate around as fast as the rods of your sha@@ ker .
AA : let &apos;s think briefly what this means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , revol@@ ve one hundred times per second , before they colli@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know because we heard it .
therein lies the abi@@ ding importance of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o p@@ aves an entirely new way of resear@@ ching the universe , as it has never been possible before .
on this road we can listen to the all and hear the invisible .
much in space we can &apos;t see -- practically or basically -- not .
a super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars explo@@ de in super @-@ nov@@ as .
they are very useful . we have learned a lot from them about space .
but the exciting physical processes occur in the nucle@@ us , which lies hidden behind thousands of kilometres of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never see through because these op@@ a@@ que are .
gravity waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass . the Big B@@ ang : I would like to explore the first minutes of the cosmos , but we will never see them as the Big B@@ ang is obsc@@ ured by his own night light .
using gravit@@ ational @-@ waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and the most important thing : I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen , we will never see , and of whom we have no idea . things we only discover by listening .
in fact , Lig@@ o found things right in the first attempt that we did not expect .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o Project , says on this topic : me : the kind of stars that produce black holes , as Lig@@ o watches them , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies from prehistoric times . the black holes are the su@@ ckers for our archaeological work so to speak .
Lig@@ o gives us a completely different point of view of the events in space , the emergence of the stars and ultimately on how we emerged from this chaos .
AA : the challenge is to be as courageous as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and the chir@@ ping of the cosmos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on earth and in space .
for what could be nic@@ er than listening to the Big B@@ ang ?
now is the time of great dreams .
do you dream with us ?
thank you .
some time ago I ta@@ sted an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a year I would say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that I was afraid of . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no matter if it made me nervous , brought me into uncomfortable situations , I forced myself to say &quot; yes . &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
did I want to be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
did I want to start playing ?
no , no , no , yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : to do exactly what I feared , removed my fear .
my fear of speaking , my social fear -- pu@@ ff , away .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has changed my life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
but there was a definite yes that changed my life deeply to an unexpected way . it started with a question of my little ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , calls all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for in@@ explic@@ able reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the South .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I need milk for my beak @-@ cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she once asked her if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said : &quot; yes . &quot;
this yes was the beginning
a new attitude to life in my family . from that moment I s@@ wore to always play with them as soon as you ask me . no matter what I &apos;m doing or where I &apos;m going , I &apos;m always saying yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I &apos;m very tired .
it has a magical effect on me , my children , on our family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it also has an amazing side effect : only recently I fully understood that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to play with my children saved my career . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have a real dream job .
I am a writer . I think of things , aw@@ aken you to life .
dream job .
no . no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I orbit television . I produce television .
I make television , in great style .
in this TV season , I am responsible for taking 70 hours of program into the world .
four television programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
each shipment contains hundreds of jobs that previously did not exist .
the budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
a new episode every nine days at four shows , so every nine days 20 million dollars television , four TV programs , 70 hours of TV , three broad@@ casts , simultaneously in production , four , 16 episodes at the same time : 24 episodes : show To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours of television ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America , my TV series will run after each other on Thursday evening .
all over the world , my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV lessons are programmes I have created myself , and not only produced , so still on top . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and tell my stories .
four TV series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fires burning all around the world .
do you know who else does that ?
nobody , therefore I am a Titan .
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with that .
I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
I say to you , that all of you who work so hard , whether you are managing a company , a country or a classroom , take a business or a household , take me seriously when I speak of work , so that you understand that I &apos;m not just walking around the computer and f@@ anci@@ ful , and it &apos;s true when I say that it &apos;s not about dreams in a dream job .
it &apos;s all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I &apos;m deep@@ ening into the work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country out of nothing .
it is as if I set troops as I painted on a canvas .
as a carrier a high tone , run a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
she is creative , mechan@@ ically , exhau@@ sting and in@@ toxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and sensible . and the best thing about it is the hum@@ ming .
there is such a change in me when the work goes well .
a bu@@ zz@@ ing starts in my head , and it grows and grows , and the hum@@ ming sounds like a busy road , I could go for it forever .
many people accept when I declare to them the sums that I am writing about writing that the writing gives me joy .
don &apos;t understand me wrong , it does .
but the hum@@ ming -- when I started with TV production , when I began to work and work , build , create and collaborate , I discovered this thing , this bu@@ zz , this energy . the hum@@ ming !
the sum is more than writing .
summ@@ ing is action and activity . summ@@ ing is a drug .
the hum@@ ming is music . the hum@@ ming is light and air .
the hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such sums then you cannot asp@@ ire differently from size .
the feeling not to be different than to strive for size , no matter what price .
this is called Sum@@ ma .
or perhaps it also means being a work@@ ah@@ olic .
maybe it &apos;s called genius .
maybe it is ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I know only that I am not do@@ omed , and I know only that I love the hum@@ ming .
I just want to tell you , I am a Titan , and I know that I don &apos;t want to question it .
to make one clear : the more successful I become , the more episodes , the more work there are , the more work there is , the more work there is , the more I write history , the more expectations there are .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the land I create , the marathon I run , the army , the canvas , the high clay , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz .
I like this bu@@ zz . I love the hum@@ ming .
I need the hum@@ ming . I am the hum@@ ming .
am I only this sum ?
and then the hum@@ ming stopped .
over@@ hau@@ led , over@@ loaded , over@@ done , burned out .
the hum@@ ming stopped .
now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that her mo@@ m is a single working title .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my mo@@ m won &apos;t be there , but you can write to my N@@ anny . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da @-@ Land . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are Baby Tit@@ ans .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when the hum@@ ming ceased .
the engine bu@@ zz was silent .
I did not love my work any more . the engine was off .
the hum@@ ming did not come back .
my hum@@ ming was broken .
I did the same things as usual : the same tit@@ anic work , 15 hours @-@ days , worked weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing to deleg@@ ate , a titanium never sleeps , does not give up , with whole heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no hum@@ ming .
in me was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a showing Titan ,
everything was grey , I just had no fun anymore .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the hum@@ ming and the hum@@ ming I was .
so what do you do if what you do is suddenly f@@ ading away the work you love ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know some may think , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Today , stupid author @-@ Titan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know you do it , you do it , you do what you do , to be a teacher , to be a ban@@ ker , a mother , a painter , Bill Gates , one loves to be a painter , Bill Gates , and you know how the hum@@ ming feels when you know the tot@@ um , who is it then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; southern states wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asks me a question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m on the way out , late and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I want to say no , when two things become aware :
&quot; &quot; &quot; first , I have to say yes to everything and second , she didn &apos;t call me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she calls no one more &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens . &quot;
when did that happen ?
I miss it when I &apos;m Titan and my sums are smo@@ other , and everything changes in front of my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about it .
we play and her sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it is outstanding , because my pain and panic , lon@@ el@@ iness and lack of hum@@ our , I can do nothing but watch out .
I am focused .
I am quiet .
the land I create , the marathon I run , the army , the canvas , the high clay - they no longer exist .
everything that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and wet kis@@ ses , tender voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons and the song in which it is about letting go , or whatever the girl in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot;
everywhere peace and simplicity is everywhere .
the air in this place is so tight that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ solves .
a mental door leaves and an energy boost is coming in .
and not immediately , but it happens it happens .
I feel it .
the hum@@ ming comes back slowly .
no full volume , barely there , it &apos;s quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there .
not the sums , but a bu@@ zz .
and now I feel like I know a magic secret .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
the tot@@ als , the working @-@ sums , the tit@@ an@@ um @-@ sum , that is only the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , when I tell you who I am , when I describe myself with the help of broad@@ casts and TV lessons and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real hum@@ ming is .
the sum is not a force and it is not labour @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real hum@@ ming depends on love .
the hum@@ ming is the current that comes from the lust of life .
the real hum@@ ming is self @-@ confidence and peace .
real summ@@ ing ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the tasks to be done , the expectation and the pressure .
the real bu@@ zz is simple and original .
the real hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered to me the wrong words , for which God told me I am a Titan ?
it is just love .
we all need a bit more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes .
I do this as a rule , so that I can free myself from any blame as a work@@ ah@@ olic .
it is law , I have no choice . I have no choice , as long as I want to hear the sums again .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
I don &apos;t really like to play as I work .
the truth hur@@ ts ,
but I don &apos;t like playing it .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer to work at work than at home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this admission is painful , because what a person rather than to be at home ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
well , I .
&quot; &quot; &quot; hon@@ estly , I call myself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Titan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- &quot; &quot; &quot;
I must have problems .
that I am too relaxed is none of it .
we gr@@ ind in the garden , before and back , back and forth .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we burst soap bubbles .
I mainly feel stiff , absent and confused .
I always use my mobile phone .
but it is ok .
my children show me how to live , and the tot@@ um of the universe fulfil@@ s me .
I play and play until I ask myself : why did we quit playing ?
you can do it too ! always tell yes if your child wishes to play with you .
perhaps you think me na@@ ï@@ ve , for a day@@ dre@@ amer .
you are right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes , until they think they want to do something different .
it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ bug or cookie replaces me .
and talk my teen@@ age daughter all for 15 minutes with me , I am the mother of the year .
it is only 15 minutes , there is no need .
everyone can take 15 minutes to play , even on a bad day !
15 minutes by play !
no mobile , no laundry , no distra@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner , the children are ready to pray .
but 15 minutes are in it !
my children are my well @-@ being , my world . it doesn &apos;t have to be the children . it is important to feel the hum@@ ming , to have a place for peace of mind .
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about joy ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general . &quot; &quot; &quot;
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what you are doing well .
find out and keep it .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I &apos;ll leave and I &apos;ll be victorious . meeting friends , reading books , enjoying the day --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is short for everything I &apos;ve given up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in training when I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes by play , why not indul@@ ge in full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong with it ? nothing !
the tot@@ um came back in my spare time . the tot@@ um seems to return if I don &apos;t work .
working does not work without playing .
it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flowing in and I find myself in my office again . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul .
I like the sums , but I don &apos;t like it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I am not the hum@@ ming , the sums are not me ... no more .
soap bubbles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends .
this is my sum .
the tot@@ ality of life .
the hum@@ ming of love .
the sum of labour is part of me , but just a part . and I am so thank@@ ful for that .
I &apos;m kid@@ ding that I &apos;m a Titan I . I &apos;ve never seen a Titan Poker on the trip to Jerusalem .
I said Yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functioning . my camp@@ fires are still burning .
the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel like a good mother .
the more I play , the clearer is my head .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the hum@@ ming . the land I create , the marathon that I run , the troops , the screens , the large sound , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz , the other , the right bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz of life .
the more I feel this bu@@ zz , the more this unusual , motiv@@ ating , naked and new feeling of being in me is spreading . less Titan -- more me !
the more I feel this bu@@ zz , the more I know who I am .
I am a writer . I think of things , I will raise you to life .
this is part of the job , which means living his dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
because a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you nice .
I am neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies .
I know how your life can change from one second to the other , after a serious stroke or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons , it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low self @-@ healing capability .
after a serious injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a lasting , severe disability .
this is probably the reason why I became a functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nervous functions through various surgical procedures .
they certainly have heard from one of the most well @-@ known , called &quot; deep brain stimulation . &quot; in doing so , they im@@ planted an electrode deep in the brain to influence neur@@ ons &quot; circuits so that the neuro@@ logical function improves .
it truly is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease who suffered under severe trem@@ ors and severe pain .
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation , however , does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion , we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to you .
with some help , the brain can help themselves .
the story began 15 years ago .
at that time , I was Chief Physi@@ cian and worked day and night in the emergency room .
often I provided patients with traum@@ atic brain trauma .
they have to imagine that the brain sw@@ ells up the brain with skull @-@ brain trauma and increases the skull &apos;s internal pressure .
to save life , you have to reduce the skull &apos;s pressure .
for this you sometimes have to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist .
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to let cells grow from this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
to let cells grow from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children who are taken out of their families .
you have to find proper nutrition , temperature , humidity and surroundings to thri@@ ve .
this is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts , it was done by Jean @-@ François .
he looked at it under his microscope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked exactly like stem cell culture . with large green cells , surrounded by small , un@@ mature cells .
perhaps you still know from biology classes that stem cells are im@@ mature cells that can transform themselves into any cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain .
it is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operation .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very fast .
they never die , they are immort@@ al .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they split slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
so we saw a new , strange cell population looking like stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently .
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ bl@@ ec@@ or@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make up 4 % of our brain @-@ rine cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of the fet@@ us they provide for the folding of the brain .
but why do they stick to us ?
we do not know this .
we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries .
but this is not so secure .
but one thing is clear -- we got our stem cells from these cells .
we stand in front of a potential cell source that enables brain healing .
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to extract a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells just as Jean @-@ François did .
and then mark them in color in order to be able to follow them in the brain .
in the last step we also re @-@ destruc@@ ted them at the t@@ apping point of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ t -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we re @-@ import these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we re @-@ import the same cells into damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller , we were able to work with apes .
in the first scenario we re @-@ ro@@ uted the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they were taken back home . the space is already occupied , they are not used there , so they disappear .
in the second scenario we added an injury and they also re @-@ en@@ um@@ ed exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew up to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could observe under the microscope .
these are the cells that have been re @-@ imported .
the evidence they show are these little points . these are the cells we dy@@ e in vitro , in culture .
of course we could not stop there .
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkey with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
you had to take pellets from a tray .
they did so very well .
when they reached a stable dex@@ ter@@ ity level , we injured in the motor cor@@ tex the manual motor area .
after that the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they could no longer move their hand .
just as it would happen in humans , they spontaneously recovered to some extent , just like after a stroke .
the patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover to some extent , just like the monkeys .
when we were sure that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left you see the monkey that spontaneously recovered .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from prior to injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
now see how we re @-@ ro@@ uted the cells : the same monkey , two months after the stimulation .
I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us too .
since that time we have found out a lot more about these cells .
we can freeze them and use later .
we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still to implant it with humans .
I really hope I can show you soon how the human brain gives us the means to heal yourself .
thank you very much .
Bruno Giussani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that just now , several dozen people in the audience , perhaps the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can do it . &quot;
I definitely .
of course , the question is what are the biggest obstacles before starting clinical trials involving human beings .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results , you have to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to pass through these kinds of studies .
BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , and so on .
J@@ B : yeah , but it needs a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you have completed the research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it takes for someone to come to the hospital and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : it &apos;s hard to say .
initially , it depends on the approval of the clinical study .
will the authority allow us to start soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to choose the patients to perform treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
then you have to apply this to a multic@@ entre study .
you first have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting TED and told us about it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider them as a matter of course .
we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it is in reality , but as an inventory of our society .
we tend to consider them as un@@ changing circumstances .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a flour@@ ishing capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
in fact democracy d@@ wind@@ les with us , in Europe .
at the beginning of the year when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- I was un@@ ambig@@ u@@ ously made clear to me as finance minister in the Euro@@ group that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- would not affect the austerity programs that were implemented in Greece .
at that moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my honest friends who repeatedly said that democracy would be aboli@@ shed if it would change anything .
at this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for a genuine democracy .
I ask you , along with me , to believe again that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro Group succ@@ um@@ b to an error , we could save the democracy , but that we need a true and defensive democracy .
for without democracy our societies will be mur@@ dering our future and wa@@ sting our great new technologies .
on the subject of waste , I would like to remind you of an interesting contradiction that currently threat@@ ens our economies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twin @-@ summit parad@@ ox &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a top is known to you . you know and recognize him as the mountain mountain that thro@@ ws his long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the mountain of debt ,
but few recognise its twin .
a mountain of unused cash , which is one of the high net worth savers and corporations , but they are too anxious to invest where it would be productive and income capable of producing the debt peak and producing all the things that humanity urgently needs , such as &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past three months , in the United States , in England and in the euro@@ zone , $ 3.4 billion was invested in all the wealth producing goods , such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on and so on .
3.4 billions of US dollars sounds much money until you compare it with the $ 5.1 tri@@ l@@ lion dollar , which at the same time lay around in the same countries and our financial institutions , and did absolutely nothing to infl@@ ame the stock exchanges and apply real estate prices .
thus debts and un@@ productive capital form the twin @-@ tops that are not offset by the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stagn@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the USA , Japan and Europe unemployed , and consequently a low overall demand that supports the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors , which , like in a continuous loop , promotes the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors in which they do not invest .
un@@ intentionally causes the circumstances causing O@@ edi@@ pus to kill him .
this is my hair with capitalism --
his ou@@ tra@@ geous art . all un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , develop human talents and especially finance all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth .
is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue , what do we mean by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the social form in which the free and the poor as a majority control the government .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy naturally concluded too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
however , it would be a mistake to mi@@ tig@@ ate the significance of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy because of these exclu@@ sions .
the decisive factor in the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that it applied the working poor , and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive , which gave them the right to political co @-@ determination with the same vocal weigh@@ ting in questions of state sab@@ ot@@ age .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy did not last long --
like a candle that shines bri@@ ghtly , it is burnt out quickly .
however , our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies do not have its roots in ancient Athens ,
but in the Magn@@ a Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Magn@@ a Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a by@@ word for rulers .
for the liberal democracy came only when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics , while the economy -- the world of corporations -- became a democracy @-@ free zone .
in our demo@@ cra@@ cies since the time when this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle took place between the two , while the economy gradually under@@ min@@ ed politics and deprived it .
do you wonder why the politicians are no longer as they used to be ?
it is not due to a degeneration of their DNA .
it is due to the fact that today it is possible to be in government and still not in power , because the power from politics has emig@@ rated into the economy and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my coat with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is like a herd of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es that have decim@@ ated the animals , from which it nour@@ ishes , decim@@ ated , that it is star@@ ving at the end .
it is similar to the economy that has so far can@@ ni@@ bal@@ ised politics that it har@@ ms itself by the self @-@ induced economic crisis itself . the power of corporations is growing , political goods are being de@@ valued , economic demand falls , and the managing directors of corporations are too frigh@@ tened to invest the cash of their companies .
the more successful capitalism exp@@ els the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; &#91; the people &#93; out of democracy , the higher the twin @-@ tops , and the greater the extravag@@ ance of human labour @-@ power and of the prosperity of humanity .
if this is true , it is obvious that we must re@@ unite the politics and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; retains control , as in ancient Athens , aside from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
this is not a new idea .
the Marxist Left had this idea 100 years ago and it did not look very well .
the doctrine of the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor regain a position as in the ancient Athens by a miracle , without creating new species of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is a solution : to aboli@@ sh the working poor !
capitalism does it by sub@@ stit@@ uting low @-@ wage workers through automation and robo@@ tics .
the problem is , as long as economy and politics are separate areas , autom@@ ating the twin tops makes the shift more sub@@ lime , and social conflicts go deeper , as I believe -- in countries like China will come .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to re@@ structure the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and pay attention to the fact that we are democr@@ ati@@ zing the re@@ united realm , otherwise we end up in a path@@ ological monitoring hyp@@ er auto@@ cr@@ acy that makes the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a documentary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the question is , therefore , not whether capitalism will survive the technological achievements that it has produced --
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to that in &quot; Matrix &quot; or by something similar to the society in &quot; Star Tre@@ k , &quot; in which machines are used , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ eni@@ ans &quot; A@@ gor@@ a , &quot; in long conversations , indul@@ ging in the meaning of life .
I think we must be optimistic .
so what would it be like to have this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia rather than the &quot; Matrix &quot; -@@ similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
in practical implementation I would like to briefly mention some examples .
in the business sector : please introduce a capital market where you earn money while working and in which your capital follows you from one employer to another , from one company to another , and the company -- no matter where you are working -- is the property of those currently working in the company .
then all income comes from capital and from redemption , and the concept of wage labour is completely out@@ dated .
no distinction between those who belong to the company but not working in it , and employees who work there , but not belonging to them . no more exchange between capital and labour , no big gaps between investment and austerity , and ultimately no rising twin @-@ tops .
in the sphere of global political economy : please state that our national currencies would have a free fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interest of all humanity .
imagine that the total world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the cosmos , &quot; in units of &quot; cosmos &quot; -- and every government pays the sum corresponding to the trade deficit or trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund .
imagine that this fund inv@@ ests in green technologies , particularly in parts of the world where investment funds are ra@@ r .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John Ma@@ yn@@ ard Key@@ nes had proposed in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference from 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
today we have it , especially against the background of a re@@ unified policy and economy .
the world I describe to you is at the same time liber@@ t@@ arian , in which she pre@@ fers privileged persons , and Marxist , because it will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the garbage of history , and Key@@ nes@@ ian , global Key@@ nes@@ ian .
but above all else it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy .
we will wake up in such a world
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
it is in our hands , and we do it more democratic .
thank you .
Bruno Giussani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself as a liber@@ t@@ arian Marxist in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if anything of what I just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant .
the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... Do we not do this , technological development will produce such a massive decline in aggregate demand , which describes Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers as &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot;
by transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next as we experience it , it will destabili@@ se not only our demo@@ cra@@ cies but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is correct , then Marx is quite relevant ,
like Hay@@ ek , therefore , I am a Liber@@ t@@ arian Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and that is why I am completely confused .
BG : indeed , and now we are well .
Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t work , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually , it was Einstein who said that . BG : in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you spoke very clearly what you think of the West &apos;s view of China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies we have the appearance of democracy .
as I said in my lecture , we have limited the democracy to politics , while the area where most of it is playing -- is the sphere of economics -- a completely democratic zone .
in a certain sense , if I can say this pro@@ voc@@ atively , China is today similar to the England of the 19th century .
for -- remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is a mistake , historically considered .
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , such as John Stu@@ art Mill --
he was particularly scep@@ tical about the democratic development .
what we can observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
China is now accused of doing what the West has done in the 19th century itself , sm@@ ells huge after hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experiences as Greek finance ministers at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I sen@@ sed that this is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later for the first half of the year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal point of view , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone ,
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; namely to say good@@ bye to self @-@ suffici@@ ency , and the ongoing den@@ ial that a massive rejection line proc@@ eeded out of the euro@@ zone and continues to thre@@ aten the development of the whole of the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which was , by the way , the first suggestion that revealed this den@@ ial --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within Europe , have continued to den@@ ounce the den@@ ial . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know what comes .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if you try to maintain an economic system that is not viable , through political will and authorit@@ ari@@ anism , you might be able to delay it for a while , but when the change occurs it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive .
BG : what changes do you see ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future if we do not change its construction .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : anyone looking back -- Seri@@ ously ...
if there is a finance minister or any minister , who after 6 months in office , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , claims he has made no mistake , then this is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the request for renewal of the debt program at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest in bank@@ ers &apos; pages to find a common solution .
but there was no such thing .
they merely wanted to bring our government , just because they did not want to deal with the distor@@ tions that ran through the euro@@ zone .
they didn &apos;t want to admit that they had been a disa@@ strous program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is worse than during the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Depression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; none of the len@@ ders of the credi@@ tors who imposed this policy on us conf@@ essed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive tone of talks , you seem to be still quite pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone is from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my greatest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive .
for if it does not survive , the released centri@@ fu@@ gal forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union .
this will not be disa@@ strous for Europe alone , but for the entire global economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we allow ourselves to suggest the way of post @-@ modern 1930 , what appears to me , it will be equally detri@@ mental to the future of Europeans and non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope you &apos;re wrong in this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you for being with TED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
of Roy Price most have never heard before , although he probably is responsible for 22 medi@@ oc@@ re minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you .
this goes back to the decision that Roy arrived three years ago .
Roy Price is senior employee at Amazon Studio ,
the TV production company from Amazon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is 47 years old , slender , has an hed@@ geho@@ g and describes on Twitter as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; movies , TV , technique , tac@@ os . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and the content that Amazon will produce .
of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought industry .
there are so many TV shows that Roy cannot choose any one .
he has to find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he must find shows that are right on this curve .
this curve is the rating distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the website IM@@ DB . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the level shows how many shows receive this rating .
if your show is judged with nine and above , this one is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these are shows like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Break@@ ing Bad &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- all the shows addic@@ ted , where , after looking for a season , your brain asks : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where are more of these episodes ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of show .
on the left , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- that should tell you enough what is going on at the end of the curve .
Roy Price doesn &apos;t worry about getting on the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to enter@@ tain &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he makes more thoughts about the medium intensity , the average TV -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t inspire .
so he must make sure that he is on the right side .
the pressure is present , and of course it is the first time that Amazon makes such a thing , so Roy Price does not want to risk anything .
he wants to create successes .
he needs guaranteed success , so he keeps a competition .
he takes a lot of ideas for TV shows and sel@@ ects eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online , where everyone can watch it for free .
and if Amazon prints out things for free , you get too , right ?
millions of viewers watch these episodes .
however , they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows .
they are observed by Roy and his team who record everything .
you capture when you start the show when you pause , which parts you skip or look at once .
they collect millions of data to decide with these data then what show they should produce .
in fact , they collect the data , process them and this results in the answer , and this reads : &quot; Amazon was supposed to make a sit@@ com via four Republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn &apos;t that good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- a bit above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked .
about at the same time with another company , another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it , but he does it slightly differently .
instead of organizing a contest , he and his team have looked at the existing data about Net@@ fli@@ x viewers , so the ratings they give the shows their course , which shows they like etc .
then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience : what shows they like , what producers , what actors .
when they had all the parts together they entered a venture and decided not to make a sit@@ com via four Sen@@ ators but a drama series about a Sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; house of Cards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gets a 9.1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , the question is : what happened here ?
it has two very competitive , data @-@ driven companies .
they connect these many data together and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this about ?
because logic somehow says that it should work with everything .
if you collect millions of data , for a decision you meet , you should make a good decision .
we have 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
it is optimized by very powerful computers .
the least thing you can expect is good television , isn &apos;t it ?
if data analysis does not work this way , it is a bit sc@@ ary because we live in a time when we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television .
does anyone know the multi @-@ health system here ?
nobody . OK , that &apos;s good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room ever comes into contact with this software . come in touch , you are in prison .
if someone is in jail in the USA and asks for dis@@ mis@@ sal , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether or not an om@@ is@@ sion occurs .
just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate TV , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis despite the many data ,
not always the best results are generated . this is not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
also the data revers@@ ed companies are sometimes wrong .
yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes .
in 2009 , Google announced that they can predict break@@ outs of flu , a bad way , by analyzing Google &apos;s research .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it worked wonderfully and was a big news sensation . the success cul@@ min@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nature &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it worked flaw@@ lessly , year by year , until it suddenly did not work anymore ,
and no one could say why .
it just didn &apos;t work , this was a sensation again , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data revers@@ ed companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
despite all these mistakes , data is increasingly entering into decisions of life -- at work , in enforcement , in medicine .
so we should better make sure that data is helpful .
I also know many problems with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded genetics -- an area where some very clever people can use a lot of data to make serious decisions , such as the decision for a cancer therapy .
or the development of a drug . over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
if you ever need to solve a complex problem , you mainly do two things :
first , dis@@ assemble this problem into its parts , so that you can analyze the items ; as a second , you put the items together again to make a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : taking apart and putting together again .
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help disman@@ tle a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision .
there is another tool for this and we all possess it : our brain .
when there is something in which the brain is good , it &apos;s parts and pieces to put together again , even if the information is incomplete , in order to make a good decision -- especially when it &apos;s the brain of an expert .
so , I think , Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and mind , where they also belong in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience what they would otherwise not have been able to do . but the decision on how to take all these parts back together and make a show like &quot; House of Cards , &quot; that was not in the data .
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team made this decision for this show , which meant they had a great personal risk with that decision .
Amazon however did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their choices , first when competing for TV ideas , then selecting &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what the data is telling us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data are helpful for better decisions , but I believe things are going wrong when data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and in order to not forget that , this device is quite useful .
many of you will ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a yes or no question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly likely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- exactly here at this moment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I will fight it later with a technical demo .
so far I have made some decisions in my life , whereby I should have listened to the ball afterwards .
but , as you naturally know , if you have the data available , you want to replace them with a bit much more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
so perhaps the ball becomes wis@@ er and wis@@ er and wis@@ er . ultimately it is up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right bend .
and I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data it is still paying off to make decisions , to be an expert in what you are doing and taking risks .
in the end , it is not the data but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve .
thank you nice .
