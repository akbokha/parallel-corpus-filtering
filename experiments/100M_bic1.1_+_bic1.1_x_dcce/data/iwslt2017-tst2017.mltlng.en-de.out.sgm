<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before someone had heard Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacularly that the NSA had illegally listened to telephones by Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But there is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he described a catastrophic US intelligence operation in which the CIA literally handed over designs to Iran for a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If that sounds crazy, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who didn't like the chapter?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years the government has been fighting against Risen and called upon him to call his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this train, he became a symbol of the government's pattern to condemn whistleblowers and spy on journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the First Constitutional Court, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right if media do not receive this information and if they cannot protect identity of the courageous they are revealing.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government knocked at Risen, he did something many courageous reporters did before him: he refused and said he'd rather go to jail.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk of going to jail.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the process, something exceptional happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, although they had years stated that it would be essential to their case, the demands of the government were dropped by rifts.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring, the reporters and sources can always hide less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of failing and splitting tears to the assertion, this could also do his digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators, without his consent, kept his telephone records secretly,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like his email data, financial and bank information, credit ratings, and even travel tips with the list of his flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information, they found evidence they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistleblower and rightful source.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect whistleblowers in his attempt to protect whistle-blowers. but instead, the judiciary has condemned more than all US governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government classifies too much of its work as a secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article on national security was the result of a whistleblower to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">So we put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional complaint, because the government has more and more options to spy on all.</seg>
<seg id="28">But just like the government's technology allows the government to circumvent the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">And they can do that from the moment they contact, rather than in retrospect, in the witness stand.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today there is communication software that didn't exist when splits had written its book, and it is much safer than normal emails or phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such technology is SecureDrop, an open source distribution system for whistleblowers, which was originally developed by the Internet world famous Aaron Swartz, and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation, in which I work.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an email, go to a news website like the one here of the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send information as usual with any contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server at which only the respective news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government can no longer obtain information secretly, and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect freedom of the press in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new spy technologies that threaten us all.</seg>
<seg id="38">It is important to us to ensure that not only technology gatherers such as Edward Snowden have a way to offend wrongdoing. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblower,</seg>
<seg id="39">Who knows about abuses in the supply of soldiers and wants to report from crowded hospitals. or the next environmental colleague who alerts the alarm to the contaminated water from Flint. or a wall street insiders who warns us before the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes but to protect our all constitutional rights." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness.] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.] This week we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.] This week we were asked by news of a leak of 11 million documents of the Panama-based law firm Mossack Fonseca.</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers are going to companies like Mossack Fonseca and say:" "" "okay, we need an anonymous enterprise. can you set up this?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the e-mails, the exchange of messages as the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to very first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's prime minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has briefcase firms in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is claimed that a track of $2 billion will lead to Russian President Vladimir Putin, a close friend of children's days, a famous cellist.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of richer people out there and others who are anxious to wait for the next release, and on the next revealed documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now it sounds like the plot of an agency writer or a John Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems to be crying out from you, to me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we do that?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not all their taxes pay, this means less money for important public services such as healthcare, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">Throughout the world, media and leading politicians are discussing how secret havens are used by a few to hide and disguise their assets -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people all over the world seem very confusing, and it's hard to understand how these tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always present it like a Matrjoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">So you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these issues.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">I think it's also interesting that there are less reports about this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">Presumably because there have so far been no prominent Americans who in these revelations came to this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">"" "" "" "now it is not that there are no rich Americans who are hiding their assets in tax havens." ""</seg>
<seg id="65">But by the principle that these tax havens work, Mossack Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a data leak from the Cayman Islands, or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the US.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, in some US states you need less information, need less information to found a company than to get a library card.</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of intransparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed scammers to rip off particularly vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it actually work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covert investigator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator came out as a African minister who wanted to bring suspicious money to the United States to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">"" "" "" "we really shocked all of us that all except one lawyer asked our investigators how he could transfer his money." ""</seg>
<seg id="76">None of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course nobody was given money to anybody. however, it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as an individual case.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our covert investigator.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "" "" "it's not about a single top politician, wrapped up in a scandal." ""</seg>
<seg id="80">It is about how the system works, through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And in order to cope with this, we have to change the rules of the game.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "we need to change the rules to make this kind of behaviour more difficult." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">That may sound very trivial as if we could not do anything about it; as if nothing ever had changed; as if there will always be the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a born optimist I see quite well that some things have started to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">"" "" "" "over the past few years we have seen violations of more transparency concerning the owners of companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="86">The topic took political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">"" "" "" "since then, the EU has gathered in central registers at national level, who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls it." ""</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the USA lags behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have submitted a bill to the bill in both parliamentary groups, but this does not make the progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how these Panama Disclosure, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and global.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment of change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who will be angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind bogus companies.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need leaders in the economy to stand up and say:" "" "transparency is not good for business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "we need leading politicians who recognise the problem and use laws to end this kind of intransparency." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">"" "" "" "together we can finally end the intransparency which is now enabling this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering." ""</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story of how I almost kidnapped and landed in the trunk of a red Mazdas.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after completing my design studies, I made a sale of postage.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stopped and looked at my things.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a road trip across the country. then he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he excitedly told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "as we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" "" "where do you sleep tonight?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">"" "he made the whole thing worse:" "" "I don't know yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought, "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just got to know him! he says he would go to the peace corps, but I don't know if he really plans it. I don't want to land in the trunk of a Mazdas!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small boot!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "then I heard say," "" "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "a voice in my head said:" "" "uh, please?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I was lying in bed, I stared at the blanket and thought, "Oh man! what caused me to rock?</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild stranger sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">"" "what if he is crazy?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I went out of bed, sleek at ten tips on the door, and shut my bedroom door shut.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in touch.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art that he had bought from me today hangs in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it completely changed my point of view.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold to me as strangers in childhood were actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">Being on my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco I took the air mattress with me.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's take a time leap, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I'm unemployed, almost broke, my roommate withdraws and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all the hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can make it easier to transform fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote to my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I thought about how we could make something to do. our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk, including a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and founded so "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three lucky guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wood floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it great, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure our cheese-ham omelets tasted differently because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them all over the city. when we bid our last guest and the door fell into the castle, Brian and I stared.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we were able to find new friends at the same time and were able to pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came rolling.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former fellow-mate, Nate Bleekczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if we could make a business concept from it.</seg>
<seg id="138">So we presented to investors: "we want to create a website where people publish pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of room whose doors are closed when visiting.</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the Internet, they can then invite other strangers to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "that will be the next great thing!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited for the missile to ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they do not.</seg>
<seg id="143">Nobody who is still in solace would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">When you have a problem, you concentrate on things that you can do well. we could design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Arts, we learned that design is much more than just appearance and feel -- it is the total experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust through design, among people who had never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design make such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a taste of which degree of trust we are striving for.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like you to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Give your locked mobile phone to your left sitting roommate.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quiet touch of panic, which you feel now -- is exactly what hosts feel when opening the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">Because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlocked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most people feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">This way, most guests also feel when they stay elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason can our company exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just like that, who actually has Al Gores mobile phone now?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please announce on Twitter that he is candidates for the office of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the cell phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I would like to share with you some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail on this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor had first presented himself with his name, if he had told where he came from, like his dog or his children?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you have 150 judgements, which all say: "he can really hold on very well sprung hands!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">A well thought-out feedback system strengthens confidence.</seg>
<seg id="173">In the beginning we did some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for people to give negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">Finally, we decided to wait until both host and guest had left their assessments before we put them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study with Stanford. we investigated how likely it is that people trust each other, depending on how much they are regarding age and place of residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">Not surprisingly, we trust the most similar to the people who are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It becomes exciting when you add a person's call -- in our case by assessments.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three judgements, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if you have more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation stems from similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted thinkers.</seg>
<seg id="186">In addition, we learned that trust is dependent on how much you buy from yourself.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "if you tell too little, for example" "" "Hi!," "" "you get no answer." ""</seg>
<seg id="189">"" "you tell too much, for example:" "" "I have problems with my mother -- --" "" "-- the request is not accepted." ""</seg>
<seg id="190">So there's an optimal degree of openness, for example "Tolle works of art in your apartment! I go on vacation with my family."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can we create it with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which subjects to write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices against foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we had not reckoned with was the great deal of people who were more than willing to displace these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people claim our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can recognize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: incredibly good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second, the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Thirdly, a need that hadn't been met before.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us business is going very well.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course, there are times when not everything runs smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have not allowed parties to celebrate parties or have devastated apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have let guests stand in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked in the customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the forefront when trust broke.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it hurts when I only think of it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that you hear in the voice of the caller was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, the 123 million overnights spent only a fraction of a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">For people were trusting each other rightly.</seg>
<seg id="210">When trust works, there can be wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holiday in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary surgery!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect home for travelers who are prone to heart attacks due to sedentary activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with adequate hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who save lives, even though they don't know one at all.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive one in your own car to the hospital, when you die, and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want one to feel lonely, they bring books by.</seg>
<seg id="220">They can even stay longer without calculating the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">So, of course, not every stay expires.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money transaction are just what you want to achieve with the share economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I first stumbled over this term, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing work with money transactions?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is a matter of economic trading.</seg>
<seg id="227">But to call it "rental industry," the thing is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People place a part of themselves open, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">When you travel today, you can compare it with Fast Food. it's efficient and reliable, but less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">What would, however, be if journeys were a rich buffet made of local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if in any place one visits, a group there would wait there to fill a thoroughly and show a quarter of a pub crawled by which one has never heard before;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays apartments are designed according to the principles of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we were to create apartments from scratch to each other?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the thought of shared sharing?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities that allow us society and relations instead of loneliness and isolation.</seg>
<seg id="239">This project has already begun in South Korea's capital Seoul. many parking lots belonging to the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">Were now offered residents. students looking for a place to stay,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were conveyed to people whose children were being moved out. incubator programs were started,</seg>
<seg id="242">In order to be able to finance new start-ups in the share economy. on our platform alone, 785,000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a stranger or even host.</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea doesn't seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We didn't reinvent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality was already there before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites ahead of us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did our work just work?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from luck and timing, we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deeply rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find it startling,</seg>
<seg id="251">Downright overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it every time a red Mazda goes by.</seg>
<seg id="253">We know, of course, that design cannot solve every problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us, if it had such a big impact, I wonder why we can use design soon.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think when you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Perhaps even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or oppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in the airport security check.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't blame you for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media represent people who look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study found that 80% of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: the Americans think most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people don't talk to their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For those who have never met a Muslim: it's great to get to know you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee lover -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A seagull-fitness fanatic,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not like Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not born this way.</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to do so.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17 years old, I made the decision to outen myself.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as a homosexual person, like some of my friends, but as Muslims. I decided to wear my head cover.</seg>

<seg id="278">The funny thing was: at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence for me, vis-à-vis the pressure I felt as a 17 year old, to adapt myself to a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only passively accepted the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have wrestled with the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, thought, asked, doubted and ultimately believed.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was trust and slow dedication, deepening with every reading of the Qur'an.</seg>

<seg id="289">Later, after my marriage, I had a child, and basically lived the "Egyptian-American Dream."</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came that terrible morning in September 2001.</seg>

<seg id="295">To have an accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical failure?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock rapidly turned into rebellion.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should we do such a thing?</seg>

<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something did not feel right.</seg>

<seg id="320">Today we can actually say people say: "there is a problem in this country -- Muslims are called.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we release them? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and join mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They talk about my church like a tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">Only the question arises: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: a malignant tumour is removed as a whole and a benign tumour is only observed under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are meaningless, because the question is false.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims, like all other Americans, are not a tumour in the body of the United States, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, first responders and Olympians.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques make America safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">There might be some parking spaces, but not stopping the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visit of a mosque leads to a more tolerant view of people of other faiths, and to show greater citizen participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as a head of the police in the Washington area, DC recently told me, people are actually not radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">In the process of radicalisation, it has been found that he begins online. first, the person is cut off from their community, even by their family, so that the extremist group can make a brainwashing that causes the person to be terrorists, and anyone who abhors their behaviour and their ideology is a traitor or fallen away from faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalisation, we have to stop people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still claim Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group like the IS establishes its brutality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As a Muslim, as a mother, as a human being, I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would fit into their imaginary world by acknowledging them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam, like the Ku Klux Clan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology in their "holy book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"" "but when you take a look at it, it does not drive on what they" "" "read" "" "in their" "" "Holy Scriptures." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that allows them to read these things into Scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she had planned to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said the problem was exactly the opposite. every clergy who spoke to them brought them to silence and told her that their anger, their sense of unrighteousness in the world, would bring them into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Inspired by nothing and something that would make sense to their anger, it was a major goal for the instrumentalization by extremists who promised a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This imam restored the connection with God and its church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accusing them for their anger, he showed their constructive ways for a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque kept her from joining the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight into how Islamophobia and my family are concerned.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect ordinary Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day, our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we fear, at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">We rather accept an authoritarian government system, conformance and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study shows that when individuals submit messages in which negative about Muslims have been reported, they rather agree military attacks on Muslim countries, as well as the circumcision of American Muslims' rights.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you look at when the mood swelled against Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up to the Iraq war and during two electoral periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected.</seg>
<seg id="365">"" "" "" "it can indeed be a tool to manipulate the public to undermine the fundament of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens." ""</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel it as the first, but the toxic air of fear hurts all of us.</seg>
<seg id="368">When assigning collective guilt it is not only about having to explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where they both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a sportsman.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was talented at the dental faculty, talented, promising...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would tell me he was the sweetest, most generous person she knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was stunned and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"" "" "" "when did I become such an accomplished young man from my little brother?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="375">Just a few weeks after Suzanne's visit to her brother and wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, murdered her, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan, who was visiting in the afternoon.</seg>

<seg id="377">Fanaticism can be not only immoral but also deadly.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or did we stay safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision, because it was about which America we want to leave to our children: one thing that would control us by fear, or one in which we can freely exercise our religion.</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided for the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the children's seat, we drove silently, with high pressure to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, pulled off my shoes, went to the prayer hall, and what I saw made me stop.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was restless.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, for half of the assembled congregation were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came not to attack us, but to assist us.</seg>
<seg id="387">In that moment I have collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had taken courage and compassion to panic and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose at the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you be safe on number?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you join those who think that we are better than those.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you very much!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have hit a nerve.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I wonder what you say to those who might say you are holding a TEDTalk, a mindset with draught, working in a classy mindset, so an exception and not the rule.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>

<seg id="402">If you look at the Muslims around the world, and I did that with the largest ever conducted study on Muslims around the world, people want normal things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want wealth for the family, they want work and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I am no exception in any way.</seg>

<seg id="407">What began as a platform for hobbyists is about to become a multi-billion dollar business.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones. this is made possible in research institutions worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air packing came into our social awareness, an autonomous fleet of flying machines in the FRAC Centre in France built a six meter high tower out of 1 500 bricks in France. some years ago, they began to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">By connecting, air devices reach high speed and acceleration in confined spaces.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also set up self-levelable structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to carry loads, deal with turbulence and generally react to laws of nature.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of possible in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">In order for a system to function autonomously, it must collectively know where the mobile objects are located in the room.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zürich we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a publisher of our laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, determine the calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "external commands exist at the highest level e. g." "" "Start" "" "and" "" "land" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called rear starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A flight device trying to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other start-ups, it is efficient in the forward flight, much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most Starrflüglers it can float, and has big advantages in starting and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a downside.</seg>
<seg id="426">A restriction of rear-starters is that they react sensitively to turbulence like wind gusts.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind this is that the flight device doesn't matter in which position the optimum position is recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Alright.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often face basic abstract questions that come to the heart of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question would be, for example, what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with thousands of moving parts that meet to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago, skilled pilots were able to fly remote-controlled aircraft, which had only two movable parts: a propeller and a stern rudder.</seg>
<seg id="435">Recently we discovered that flies work with only one.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the monospinner, the mechanically simplest remote-operated flight device. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only a moving part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No flaps, hinges and cross rods, no further actuators or control surfaces, only a propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanically simple, the inner life happens very much so that it can fly stable and move anywhere in the room.</seg>
<seg id="440">However, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the stern roller. to bring it to fly, I have to throw it exactly right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The probability to really throw it right when all look at me is low, so I'll show you a video that was filmed last night.</seg>
<seg id="442">If the monospinner is an exercise in carelessness, this machine is here, the omnibus with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why it is ambivalent in its orientation.</seg>
<seg id="446">As a result, he receives the extraordinary ability,</seg>
<seg id="447">Move in space in all directions, no matter what direction it is turned or even rotated.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers from the eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some can be seen in models, the rest is learned directly while flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's look at it.</seg>
<seg id="451">When flying machines are to be a part of our everyday life, they must become extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is made up of two separate two propellers.</seg>
<seg id="453">This rotates clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other anti-clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you build them together, they behave like a high-performance Quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">If something goes wrong -- an engine or propeller dies off, the electronics or a battery -- the machine can continue flying even if restricted.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate this now by making one half flightless.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration will examine synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a pallet of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took commercially available Micro-Quadcopter -- each single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where in the room it is and is self-controlled. that is why there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully you will motivate these demonstrations to rethink new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly secure machine as it is on Broadway would like to become a flying lamp shade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us, wages are in development and creative act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a reminder how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, smart creatures to form them in such a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive industrial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="469">1.3 billion years ago, two black holes orbiting in a very far distant galaxy circled each other faster, so the mass of three suns turned into pure energy in a tenth of a second.</seg>
<seg id="470">This short moment they lit more brightly than all the stars together in all the galaxies of the entire universe known to us.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big boy.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they did not set their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">Finally we speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The whole energy was released into space-time structure itself and the universe exploded in gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">First, let's arrange the events in time.</seg>
<seg id="476">It was 1.3 billion years ago that there was just a multi-celestial life on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then the earth has brought forth a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, humans and -- God is up to us -- even the internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, a group of particularly courageous -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from Caltech - decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gravitational-waves, which are caused by colliding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them were crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized them as crazy geniuses, so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, design, conception and extremely hard work they built the detector ligo: the laser interferometer gravitational-waves-observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the following period, the precision of Ligo could be substantially increased, which greatly improved detection performance.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is called Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015, Ligo was launched for a final test run in order to clarify some smaller, stubborn problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On September 14, 2015, only a few days after the start of the detector, the gravitational-waves of the two colliding black holes crossed through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">You went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell to my death-sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically they were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All that I had worked for is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has studied gravity waves from black holes for 23 years and their through observatories like ligo measurable signals. but what are gravitational-waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A wave of gravitation is a cluttering in the structure of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When passing the shaft, the space and its entire contents are stretched in one direction and stowed in the other direction.</seg>
<seg id="495">In contemplation, lecturers in courses of relativity often lead a really albernal dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"" "" "" "stretch and dust, stretch and dust" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational-waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous, are.</seg>
<seg id="498">On September 14th, for example, everyone was stretched and stowed by us when hitting the waves. the elongation of an average man was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">This means 20 zeros after the comma, followed by a 1. that is why the Ligo staff was declared mad.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five kilometer long laser detector, and this is already absurd, this length would have to be measured to less than one thousandth of the radius of an atomic nucleus. this is grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classical text about gravity</seg>
<seg id="502">"" "Kip Thorne, a co-founder of Ligos, described the hunt for the waves as follows:" "" "the technical difficulties in the construction of such detectors are enormous." ""</seg>
<seg id="503">"" "but physicists are inventive and with the support of the public all obstacles will be overcome." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this in 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott likes to say that Ligo is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength that is much smaller than the things around us: facial features, the size of your cell.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practical, because so you can customize a picture or a map of things by using the light coming from several points around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">In the case of sounds, this is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">That is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that particularly mean you:</seg>
<seg id="512">The face of your child, for example.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead we listen to certain qualities such as pitch and pitch, rhythm and volume in order to close the story behind it.</seg>
<seg id="514">"" "" "" "now Alice is talking." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts her."</seg>
<seg id="516">"" "" "" "dumb Bob." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot make simple pictures of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by looking at changes in the amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo, the measured frequencies are in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">So when we convert wave patterns into sound, we can literally hear the universe speak.</seg>
<seg id="522">To listen to the gravity, about the collision of two black holes can tell us about the collision with which my colleague Scott is already busy for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-rotating holes, simply chirp: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">If the two bodies rotate very quickly, you hear the same pair of pups with an additional key change. you can listen to the wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement vocabulary, imprinted in the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date, which at least I will never forget, Ligo heard the following: [Surrender's noise] Someone who knows what to listen to, detects this as a sound of -- SH:... two black holes with a 30-fold solar mass, which rotate around as fast as the rods of your shaker.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's think briefly what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the densest body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, revolve one hundred times per second, before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know because we heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the abiding importance of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo paves an entirely new way of researching the universe, as it has never been possible before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this road we can listen to the all and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in space we can't see -- practically or basically -- not.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why massereiche stars explode in super-novas.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we have learned a lot from them about space.</seg>
<seg id="538">But the exciting physical processes occur in the nucleus, which lies hidden behind thousands of kilometres of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see through because these opaque are.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravity waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass. the Big Bang: I would like to explore the first minutes of the cosmos, but we will never see them as the Big Bang is obscured by his own night light.</seg>
<seg id="541">Using gravitational-waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And the most important thing: I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen, we will never see, and of whom we have no idea. things we only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, Ligo found things right in the first attempt that we did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo Project, says on this topic: me: the kind of stars that produce black holes, as Ligo watches them, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient bodies from prehistoric times. the black holes are the suckers for our archaeological work so to speak.</seg>
<seg id="546">Ligo gives us a completely different point of view of the events in space, the emergence of the stars and ultimately on how we emerged from this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is to be as courageous as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and the chirping of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be nicer than listening to the Big Bang?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Do you dream with us?</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tasted an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "for a year I would say" "" "yes!" "" "that I was afraid of." ""</seg>
<seg id="556">No matter if it made me nervous, brought me into uncomfortable situations, I forced myself to say "yes."</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Did I want to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I want to start playing?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, yes, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: to do exactly what I feared, removed my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear of speaking, my social fear -- puff, away.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"" "" "" "yes" "" "has changed my life." ""</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a definite yes that changed my life deeply to an unexpected way. it started with a question of my little ones.</seg>
<seg id="569">"" "I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the smallest, calls all" "" "kitten" "" "for inexplicable reasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she were a waitress from the South.</seg>
<seg id="571">"" "" "" "kittens, I need milk for my beak-cup." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="572">She once asked her if I could play with her when I was on the go. and I said: "yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">This yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new attitude to life in my family. from that moment I swore to always play with them as soon as you ask me. no matter what I'm doing or where I'm going, I'm always saying yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect, but I'm very tired.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, my children, on our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">"" "but it also has an amazing side effect: only recently I fully understood that" "" "yes" "" "to play with my children saved my career." ""</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am a writer. I think of things, awaken you to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No. no.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I orbit television. I produce television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I make television, in great style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season, I am responsible for taking 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four television programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each shipment contains hundreds of jobs that previously did not exist.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode every nine days at four shows, so every nine days 20 million dollars television, four TV programs, 70 hours of TV, three broadcasts, simultaneously in production, four, 16 episodes at the same time: 24 episodes: show To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours of television,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America, my TV series will run after each other on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world, my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV lessons are programmes I have created myself, and not only produced, so still on top. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans around the campfire and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four TV series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfires burning all around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who else does that?</seg>
<seg id="598">Nobody, therefore I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with that.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it because I know what you think when the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">I say to you, that all of you who work so hard, whether you are managing a company, a country or a classroom, take a business or a household, take me seriously when I speak of work, so that you understand that I'm not just walking around the computer and fanciful, and it's true when I say that it's not about dreams in a dream job.</seg>
<seg id="603">It's all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work a lot, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I'm deepening into the work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is as if I set troops as I painted on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">As a carrier a high tone, run a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">She is creative, mechanically, exhausting and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and sensible. and the best thing about it is the humming.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work goes well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A buzzing starts in my head, and it grows and grows, and the humming sounds like a busy road, I could go for it forever.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people accept when I declare to them the sums that I am writing about writing that the writing gives me joy.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong, it does.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the humming -- when I started with TV production, when I began to work and work, build, create and collaborate, I discovered this thing, this buzz, this energy. the humming!</seg>
<seg id="618">The sum is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">Summing is action and activity. summing is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The humming is music. the humming is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The humming is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such sums then you cannot aspire differently from size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling not to be different than to strive for size, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called Summa.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or perhaps it also means being a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Maybe it's called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Maybe it is ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I know only that I am not doomed, and I know only that I love the humming.</seg>
<seg id="631">I just want to tell you, I am a Titan, and I know that I don't want to question it.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make one clear: the more successful I become, the more episodes, the more work there are, the more work there is, the more work there is, the more I write history, the more expectations there are.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The land I create, the marathon I run, the army, the canvas, the high clay, the buzz, the buzz, the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this buzz. I love the humming.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the humming. I am the humming.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I only this sum?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the humming stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Overhauled, overloaded, overdone, burned out.</seg>
<seg id="642">The humming stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that her mom is a single working title.</seg>
<seg id="644">"" "Harper tells people:" "" "my mom won't be there, but you can write to my Nanny." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="645">"" "and Emerson said:" "" "kittens, I want to go to Shonda-Land." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="646">It is the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are Baby Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1, when the humming ceased.</seg>
<seg id="649">The engine buzz was silent.</seg>
<seg id="650">I did not love my work any more. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The humming did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My humming was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I did the same things as usual: the same titanic work, 15 hours-days, worked weekends, no remorse, nothing to delegate, a titanium never sleeps, does not give up, with whole heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no humming.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a showing Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was grey, I just had no fun anymore.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the humming and the humming I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do if what you do is suddenly fading away the work you love?</seg>
<seg id="665">"" "I know some may think," "" "Today, stupid author-Titan." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know you do it, you do it, you do what you do, to be a teacher, to be a banker, a mother, a painter, Bill Gates, one loves to be a painter, Bill Gates, and you know how the humming feels when you know the totum, who is it then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">When the song of my heart stops, can I survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">"" "and then my" "" "southern states waitress" "" "asks me a question." ""</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "I'm on the way out, late and she says," "" "Mama, do you like to play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I want to say no, when two things become aware:</seg>
<seg id="674">"" "first, I have to say yes to everything and second, she didn't call me" "" "kittens" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="675">She calls no one more "kittens."</seg>
<seg id="676">When did that happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">I miss it when I'm Titan and my sums are smoother, and everything changes in front of my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">"" "and so she says," "" "Mama, do you like to play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">"" "and I say," "" "Yes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about it.</seg>
<seg id="681">We play and her sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read dramatically from the book "Everybody Poops."</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding, because my pain and panic, loneliness and lack of humour, I can do nothing but watch out.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">The land I create, the marathon I run, the army, the canvas, the high clay - they no longer exist.</seg>
<seg id="687">Everything that exists are sticky fingers and wet kisses, tender voices, wax crayons and the song in which it is about letting go, or whatever the girl in "The Ice Queen."</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere peace and simplicity is everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so tight that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door leaves and an energy boost is coming in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And not immediately, but it happens it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The humming comes back slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, barely there, it's quiet, barely audible, but it's there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the sums, but a buzz.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I know a magic secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The totals, the working-sums, the titanum-sum, that is only the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are, when I tell you who I am, when I describe myself with the help of broadcasts and TV lessons and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real humming is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The sum is not a force and it is not labour-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real humming depends on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The humming is the current that comes from the lust of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real humming is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">Real summing ignores the pressure of history, the tasks to be done, the expectation and the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real buzz is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real humming is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered to me the wrong words, for which God told me I am a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a bit more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I do this as a rule, so that I can free myself from any blame as a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no choice. I have no choice, as long as I want to hear the sums again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">I don't really like to play as I work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth hurts,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like playing it.</seg>

<seg id="729">I must have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed is none of it.</seg>
<seg id="731">We grind in the garden, before and back, back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">I mainly feel stiff, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always use my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is ok.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live, and the totum of the universe fulfils me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why did we quit playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can do it too! always tell yes if your child wishes to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Perhaps you think me naïve, for a daydreamer.</seg>
<seg id="742">You are right, but you can do it too!</seg>

<seg id="746">It is only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes, until they think they want to do something different.</seg>
<seg id="748">It is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>

<seg id="796">I am neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to the other, after a serious stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgeons, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low self-healing capability.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a serious injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a lasting, severe disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I became a functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nervous functions through various surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="804">They certainly have heard from one of the most well-known, called "deep brain stimulation." in doing so, they implanted an electrode deep in the brain to influence neurons "circuits so that the neurological function improves.</seg>
<seg id="805">It truly is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease who suffered under severe tremors and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation, however, does not mean neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion, we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to you.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help, the brain can help themselves.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At that time, I was Chief Physician and worked day and night in the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I provided patients with traumatic brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They have to imagine that the brain swells up the brain with skull-brain trauma and increases the skull's internal pressure.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save life, you have to reduce the skull's pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">For this you sometimes have to remove a part of swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to let cells grow from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">To let cells grow from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children who are taken out of their families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You have to find proper nutrition, temperature, humidity and surroundings to thrive.</seg>
<seg id="823">This is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts, it was done by Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="825">He looked at it under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked exactly like stem cell culture. with large green cells, surrounded by small, unmature cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you still know from biology classes that stem cells are immature cells that can transform themselves into any cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operation.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very fast.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They split slowly and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, strange cell population looking like stem cells, but behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed a long time to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make up 4% of our brain-rine cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the stage of the fetus they provide for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stick to us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know this.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they participate in the healing of the brain, as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so secure.</seg>
<seg id="848">But one thing is clear -- we got our stem cells from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We stand in front of a potential cell source that enables brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to extract a piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells just as Jean-François did.</seg>
<seg id="853">And then mark them in color in order to be able to follow them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step we also re-destructed them at the tapping point of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplant -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we re-import these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we re-import the same cells into damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller, we were able to work with apes.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario we re-routed the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they were taken back home. the space is already occupied, they are not used there, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we added an injury and they also re-enumed exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew up to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been re-imported.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence they show are these little points. these are the cells we dye in vitro, in culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Of course we could not stop there.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkey with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">You had to take pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They did so very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they reached a stable dexterity level, we injured in the motor cortex the manual motor area.</seg>
<seg id="869">After that the monkeys were paralyzed, they could no longer move their hand.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen in humans, they spontaneously recovered to some extent, just like after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">The patients are paralyzed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. they recover to some extent, just like the monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were sure that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left you see the monkey that spontaneously recovered.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance from prior to injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now see how we re-routed the cells: the same monkey, two months after the stimulation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us too.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found out a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and use later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other neuropathological models, for example Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implant it with humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope I can show you soon how the human brain gives us the means to heal yourself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that just now, several dozen people in the audience, perhaps the majority, think: "I know someone who can do it."</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what are the biggest obstacles before starting clinical trials involving human beings.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results, you have to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to pass through these kinds of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yeah, but it needs a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future -- you have completed the research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it takes for someone to come to the hospital and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: it's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">Initially, it depends on the approval of the clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authority allow us to start soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to choose the patients to perform treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">Then you have to apply this to a multicentre study.</seg>
<seg id="897">You first have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and told us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider them as a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">We do not see democracy as the fragile plant it is in reality, but as an inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as unchanging circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great imitators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a flourishing capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">In fact democracy dwindles with us, in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- I was unambiguously made clear to me as finance minister in the Eurogroup that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- would not affect the austerity programs that were implemented in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At that moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my honest friends who repeatedly said that democracy would be abolished if it would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for a genuine democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I ask you, along with me, to believe again that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Euro Group succumb to an error, we could save the democracy, but that we need a true and defensive democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">For without democracy our societies will be murdering our future and wasting our great new technologies.</seg>
<seg id="914">On the subject of waste, I would like to remind you of an interesting contradiction that currently threatens our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">"" "I call it the" "" "twin-summit paradox" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="916">A top is known to you. you know and recognize him as the mountain mountain that throws his long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the mountain of debt,</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognise its twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash, which is one of the high net worth savers and corporations, but they are too anxious to invest where it would be productive and income capable of producing the debt peak and producing all the things that humanity urgently needs, such as "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past three months, in the United States, in England and in the eurozone, $3.4 billion was invested in all the wealth producing goods, such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment and so on and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 billions of US dollars sounds much money until you compare it with the $5.1 trillion dollar, which at the same time lay around in the same countries and our financial institutions, and did absolutely nothing to inflame the stock exchanges and apply real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus debts and unproductive capital form the twin-tops that are not offset by the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the USA, Japan and Europe unemployed, and consequently a low overall demand that supports the pessimism of investors, which, like in a continuous loop, promotes the pessimism of investors in which they do not invest.</seg>
<seg id="925">Unintentionally causes the circumstances causing Oedipus to kill him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my hair with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">His outrageous art. all unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, develop human talents and especially finance all the technologies, "green" technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we continue, what do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the social form in which the free and the poor as a majority control the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy naturally concluded too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, it would be a mistake to mitigate the significance of the Athenian democracy because of these exclusions.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decisive factor in the Athenian democracy was and is that it applied the working poor, and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive, which gave them the right to political co-determination with the same vocal weighting in questions of state sabotage.</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy did not last long --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle that shines brightly, it is burnt out quickly.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our liberal democracies do not have its roots in ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the Athenian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Magna Carta, which ultimately was a byword for rulers.</seg>
<seg id="940">For the liberal democracy came only when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics, while the economy -- the world of corporations -- became a democracy-free zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In our democracies since the time when this separation of politics and economy began, a relentless struggle took place between the two, while the economy gradually undermined politics and deprived it.</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why the politicians are no longer as they used to be?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not due to a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is due to the fact that today it is possible to be in government and still not in power, because the power from politics has emigrated into the economy and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my coat with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is like a herd of carnivores that have decimated the animals, from which it nourishes, decimated, that it is starving at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">It is similar to the economy that has so far cannibalised politics that it harms itself by the self-induced economic crisis itself. the power of corporations is growing, political goods are being devalued, economic demand falls, and the managing directors of corporations are too frightened to invest the cash of their companies.</seg>
<seg id="948">The more successful capitalism expels the "demos" [the people] out of democracy, the higher the twin-tops, and the greater the extravagance of human labour-power and of the prosperity of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="949">If this is true, it is obvious that we must reunite the politics and the economy, and it would be better if the "demos" retains control, as in ancient Athens, aside from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist Left had this idea 100 years ago and it did not look very well.</seg>
<seg id="952">The doctrine of the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor regain a position as in the ancient Athens by a miracle, without creating new species of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: to abolish the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by substituting low-wage workers through automation and robotics.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is, as long as economy and politics are separate areas, automating the twin tops makes the shift more sublime, and social conflicts go deeper, as I believe -- in countries like China will come.</seg>
<seg id="956">"" "" "" "we need to restructure the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics, and pay attention to the fact that we are democratizing the reunited realm, otherwise we end up in a pathological monitoring hyper autocracy that makes the film" "" "matrix" "" "like a documentary." ""</seg>
<seg id="957">The question is, therefore, not whether capitalism will survive the technological achievements that it has produced --</seg>
<seg id="958">The more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to that in "Matrix" or by something similar to the society in "Star Trek," in which machines are used, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians "Agora," in long conversations, indulging in the meaning of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it be like to have this "Star Trek" -like utopia rather than the "Matrix" -similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation I would like to briefly mention some examples.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the business sector: please introduce a capital market where you earn money while working and in which your capital follows you from one employer to another, from one company to another, and the company -- no matter where you are working -- is the property of those currently working in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income comes from capital and from redemption, and the concept of wage labour is completely outdated.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction between those who belong to the company but not working in it, and employees who work there, but not belonging to them. no more exchange between capital and labour, no big gaps between investment and austerity, and ultimately no rising twin-tops.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the sphere of global political economy: please state that our national currencies would have a free fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [group of the 20 largest emerging countries], in the interest of all humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that the total world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it "the cosmos," in units of "cosmos" -- and every government pays the sum corresponding to the trade deficit or trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund invests in green technologies, particularly in parts of the world where investment funds are rar.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes had proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference from 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today we have it, especially against the background of a reunified policy and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world I describe to you is at the same time libertarian, in which she prefers privileged persons, and Marxist, because it will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the garbage of history, and Keynesian, global Keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all else it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">We will wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a "matrix" - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands, and we do it more democratic.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself as a libertarian Marxist in your biography.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if anything of what I just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for the reunification of politics and economy is... Do we not do this, technological development will produce such a massive decline in aggregate demand, which describes Larry Summers as "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">By transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next as we experience it, it will destabilise not only our democracies but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is correct, then Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Like Hayek, therefore, I am a Libertarian Marxist, and like Keynes, and that is why I am completely confused.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: indeed, and now we are well.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you don't work, you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually, it was Einstein who said that. BG: in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you spoke very clearly what you think of the West's view of China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the appearance of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my lecture, we have limited the democracy to politics, while the area where most of it is playing -- is the sphere of economics -- a completely democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In a certain sense, if I can say this provocatively, China is today similar to the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- remember -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- this is a mistake, historically considered.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberals, such as John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical about the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What we can observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">China is now accused of doing what the West has done in the 19th century itself, smells huge after hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experiences as Greek finance ministers at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I sensed that this is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later for the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from personal point of view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece, but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">"" "" "" "namely to say goodbye to self-sufficiency, and the ongoing denial that a massive rejection line proceeded out of the eurozone and continues to threaten the development of the whole of the European Union." ""</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity, on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which was, by the way, the first suggestion that revealed this denial --</seg>
<seg id="1008">"" "" "" "unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within Europe, have continued to denounce the denial." ""</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If you try to maintain an economic system that is not viable, through political will and authoritarianism, you might be able to delay it for a while, but when the change occurs it happens abruptly and destructive.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes do you see ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future if we do not change its construction.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: anyone looking back -- Seriously...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a finance minister or any minister, who after 6 months in office, especially in such a tense situation, claims he has made no mistake, then this is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the request for renewal of the debt program at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest in bankers' pages to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But there was no such thing.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They merely wanted to bring our government, just because they did not want to deal with the distortions that ran through the eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They didn't want to admit that they had been a disastrous program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost a third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">"" "it is worse than during the" "" "Great Depression." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1026">"" "none of the lenders of the creditors who imposed this policy on us confessed:" "" "this was a colossal mistake." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1027">BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive tone of talks, you seem to be still quite pro-European.</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">"" "" "" "my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is from someone who lives and loves Europe." ""</seg>
<seg id="1030">My greatest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">For if it does not survive, the released centrifugal forces will be demonic and destroy the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This will not be disastrous for Europe alone, but for the entire global economy.</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">If we allow ourselves to suggest the way of post-modern 1930, what appears to me, it will be equally detrimental to the future of Europeans and non-Europeans.</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope you're wrong in this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Yanis, thank you for being with TED.</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">Of Roy Price most have never heard before, although he probably is responsible for 22 mediocre minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision that Roy arrived three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is senior employee at Amazon Studio,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"" "he is 47 years old, slender, has an hedgehog and describes on Twitter as" "" "movies, TV, technique, tacos." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and the content that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course, this is a very hard-fought industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV shows that Roy cannot choose any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He has to find shows that are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he must find shows that are right on this curve.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the rating distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the website IMDB. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the level shows how many shows receive this rating.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is judged with nine and above, this one is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"" "these are shows like" "" "Breaking Bad" "", "" Game of Thrones, "" "" "The Wire" "" "-- all the shows addicted, where, after looking for a season, your brain asks:" "" "where are more of these episodes?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left, here at this end, shows like "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- that should tell you enough what is going on at the end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price doesn't worry about getting on the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to entertain "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes more thoughts about the medium intensity, the average TV -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply don't inspire.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure that he is on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is present, and of course it is the first time that Amazon makes such a thing, so Roy Price does not want to risk anything.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs guaranteed success, so he keeps a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes a lot of ideas for TV shows and selects eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online, where everyone can watch it for free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon prints out things for free, you get too, right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers watch these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are observed by Roy and his team who record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You capture when you start the show when you pause, which parts you skip or look at once.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide with these data then what show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">In fact, they collect the data, process them and this results in the answer, and this reads: "Amazon was supposed to make a sitcom via four Republican US senators."</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"" "yes," "" "Alpha House" "", "but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn't that good." ""</seg>
<seg id="1072">It's just an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- a bit above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About at the same time with another company, another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix. just like Roy, he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it, but he does it slightly differently.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of organizing a contest, he and his team have looked at the existing data about Netflix viewers, so the ratings they give the shows their course, which shows they like etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience: what shows they like, what producers, what actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together they entered a venture and decided not to make a sitcom via four Senators but a drama series about a Senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"" "" "" "house of Cards" "" "gets a 9.1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go." ""</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course, the question is: what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">It has two very competitive, data-driven companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data together and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this about?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow says that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you collect millions of data, for a decision you meet, you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">We have 200 years of statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized by very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The least thing you can expect is good television, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis does not work this way, it is a bit scary because we live in a time when we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the multi-health system here?</seg>
<seg id="1091">Nobody. OK, that's good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room ever comes into contact with this software. come in touch, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is in jail in the USA and asks for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether or not an omission occurs.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate TV, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are generated. this is not because a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Also the data reversed companies are sometimes wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that they can predict breakouts of flu, a bad way, by analyzing Google's research.</seg>
<seg id="1101">"" "it worked wonderfully and was a big news sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the magazine" "" "Nature" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked flawlessly, year by year, until it suddenly did not work anymore,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It just didn't work, this was a sensation again, including the revocation of the publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data reversed companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all these mistakes, data is increasingly entering into decisions of life -- at work, in enforcement, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should better make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many problems with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very clever people can use a lot of data to make serious decisions, such as the decision for a cancer therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you ever need to solve a complex problem, you mainly do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">First, disassemble this problem into its parts, so that you can analyze the items; as a second, you put the items together again to make a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: taking apart and putting together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help dismantle a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool for this and we all possess it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">When there is something in which the brain is good, it's parts and pieces to put together again, even if the information is incomplete, in order to make a good decision -- especially when it's the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">So, I think, Netflix was so successful because they used data and mind, where they also belong in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience what they would otherwise not have been able to do. but the decision on how to take all these parts back together and make a show like "House of Cards," that was not in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team made this decision for this show, which meant they had a great personal risk with that decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon however did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their choices, first when competing for TV ideas, then selecting "Alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "it was a safe decision because they could always say:" "" "this is what the data is telling us." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful for better decisions, but I believe things are going wrong when data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and in order to not forget that, this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"" "it is also called" "" "Magic 8 Ball." "" "it's amazing. for decisions using a yes or no question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer." "" "highly likely" "" "-- exactly here at this moment." ""</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will fight it later with a technical demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far I have made some decisions in my life, whereby I should have listened to the ball afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you naturally know, if you have the data available, you want to replace them with a bit much more sophisticated, such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So perhaps the ball becomes wiser and wiser and wiser. ultimately it is up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right bend.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data it is still paying off to make decisions, to be an expert in what you are doing and taking risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">In the end, it is not the data but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you nice.</seg>
