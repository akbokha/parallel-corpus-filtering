Munich 18@@ 56 : four cards that change your view of the city
an Ir@@ ren @-@ Anst@@ alt , where young people should meet today .
a cryp@@ t chapel , where it is now dug for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
farmers cultivate the former cause of farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories on days .
it &apos;s annoying when maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
everybody knows that , who had to get upset , because the car @-@ navigation system showed a green meadow instead of a b@@ ypass road .
the historic maps of the Bavarian Bavaria @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ al Bavaria of the state government , are anything but current - but it is very enligh@@ tening .
especially if you compare them with current online cards .
then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities in the spread @-@ area of Munich &apos;s Mer@@ cury have changed since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a pat@@ ch@@ work that is not recognized as such .
the large overview map has been incorporated into more detailed maps for cities and municipalities , so @-@ called documents .
these were created according to the Bay@@ erische Ver@@ mess@@ ungs@@ verwaltung between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and originates from the first surve@@ ying in Bavaria .
your principal : Napoleon .
the French military commander occupied Bavaria since the spring 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a top@@ ographic survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
even if French troops finally de@@ ported with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville on 9 February 18@@ 01 : it was the present neighbours who created the idea of an area @-@ wide Bavaria map .
Elec@@ tor Max IV Joseph drove the project forward , founded the &quot; Top@@ ograph@@ ische Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bay@@ erische surve@@ ying administration .
the position sheet for Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 and is to be found like all others on the website of the Bavarian State Library .
the comparison Early / Today is most impressive in the example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
one example is sub@@ sen@@ d@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 .
S@@ end@@ ling was born 21 years after the creation of the map , that is , in 18@@ 77 , as the Munich district .
today , Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling is located in the middle of the city .
the houses of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ lings are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along the today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser in 18@@ 78 , a leader of the revol@@ t of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where today the West@@ park is , one sees nothing but fields - at first sight : in zo@@ oming a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears : hand@@ written numbered plots of the so @-@ called &quot; pri@@ mor@@ dial &quot; from which the base tax was derived .
&quot; &quot; &quot; small plots there are no longer occupied by farmers , but farmers of the plant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land in the sun &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , the venue of the Oktober@@ fest since 18@@ 10 , was in fact a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete jungle .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the area of the present district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen one reads not only the street name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Gast@@ ei@@ g &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or from the height &quot; Auf der Lü@@ ften &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the area of today &apos;s Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen area . &quot; &quot; &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße , one once locked people with del@@ u@@ sions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich @-@ Kreis @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Auf der Au@@ er Lü@@ ften &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was created . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard of G@@ ud@@ den headed the institution - the psychiat@@ rist , who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was advanced for his time and finished for example the ank@@ ering of so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
moreover , he for@@ bi@@ ds the personnel to use force against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann William , head of the Museum Hai@@ d@@ hausen who has engaged in an exhibition with the institution .
initially there was room for 280 patients , later expanded to 500 places .
at some point , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the rotary mill in hair 1905 .
Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er @-@ Klin@@ ik@@ um Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts since 2006 .
young people meet in the area of the former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt in the Munich @-@ based Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with training facilities .
West is the football field of TS@@ V München Ost , east of residential buildings from the 1980s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was built in an architectural resem@@ b@@ lance to the original building of the Ir@@ ren@@ ia , which had been destroyed during the Second World War by bombing ra@@ ids . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Main Square &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 56 , the Kauf@@ inger Street was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Second World War brought a decisive change also in the heart of Munich .
the Al@@ lied bom@@ b@@ ings broke many holes in the city centre in December 1944 .
a large one remained until today - at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
the English Institute , small business houses and a chapel from the Middle Ages , once stood at the Mari@@ en@@ hof , where these days work and on April 5 , 2017 the ground@@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn commu@@ ter route takes place .
with the slider you can compare the old Munich @-@ map with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
Om@@ bud@@ s@@ man publishes Travel War@@ ning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for the Adv@@ ancement of Far@@ ms has issued a warning for coloured people who are travelling to Mis@@ sour@@ i because of discrimin@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks on the state .
&quot; the NA@@ P@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the State of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is to enter into force by 28 August 2017 , calls for special attention to af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans , as a series of question@@ able , race @-@ based incidents seem to occur throughout the state and be noted here , &quot; says the Group .
a recently adopted law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it harder for people to win discrimination , as well as the law enforcement authorities who dispro@@ portion@@ ately target minorities , prompted the group to issue travel warnings , said the NA@@ P@@ AC@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have violations of civil rights that happen to people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are hal@@ ted because of their skin colour , they will be beaten or killed , &quot; said the President of Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ P@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear discomfort in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the United States .
the group cited alleg@@ ations such as rac@@ ist reloc@@ ation against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see .
S@@ anders died in du@@ bi@@ ous circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no more gasoline during the trip and was taken into custody by the Mis@@ sour@@ i police without bl@@ aming a crime .
the Council also points to a recent report of the Mis@@ sour@@ i General At@@ tor@@ ney General , which shows that black mot@@ ori@@ sts in the state are 75 percent more common than wh@@ ites .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people need to be willing to take advantage of it or let the relatives know that they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the hate crime report programme of the FB@@ I , which classi@@ fies the state as regards the number of such injuries to the 16th place of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; travel warnings are also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it more difficult to acc@@ use a company on account of housing or employment discrimination . &quot; &quot; &quot;
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona , after the states had adopted immigration laws that would bind local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for immigration infrin@@ gements .
travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries , but lately interest groups have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States .
fence project is elementary
the Fisch@@ bacher Wei@@ dez@@ v@@ n project is a successful project and will continue next year .
the CD@@ U Members of Parliament Peter Weiss and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac have obtained a picture on the spot .
representatives of the Fis@@ her@@ bach CD@@ U local association together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties met with the rec@@ tom@@ en@@ hof of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family .
Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann granted first insight into his farm in which he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 milk cows and as many young k@@ itt@@ ens and houses in five apartments Feri@@ eng@@ a@@ este .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black Forest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the alternative marketing path for him for the milk of his cows , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Regi@@ on@@ ales are at the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ a@@ este .
since he is also B@@ L@@ H@@ V Chairman of Fischer@@ bach , he called the fence project as &quot; essential . &quot;
I cannot manage on such steep faces .
the gr@@ ass@@ land area is prepared for a lot of work , and much has to be handled with the brus@@ h@@ cutter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight with the conditions and top@@ ography here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 , he took over the par@@ ental operation and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertili@@ ser , even if he does not carry out a bio @-@ operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commune has recognised the importance of the fence project and is glad about the leadership development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare , farmers would have to be supported .
it is hoped that the re@@ for@@ estation of the surfaces could be pulled out for quite a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest treasure we have is the people working in agriculture and thinking about how they continue their operation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mayor stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers are often critic@@ ised because of funding
a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013 via the fence construction .
the area of disclosure amounts to 40 hectares which may not be explored until at least 20@@ 23 .
half of the total costs in the amount of 71 500 euros were promoted by leader , a quarter carried the municipality of Fischer@@ bach .
the farmers thus remained 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers of electric fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the big advantage is the durability of the f@@ ences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are doing a really good job without farmers and land@@ wives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Peter Weiss has also stood firm : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best food is produced here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land@@ schaft@@ spf@@ lege Directive ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg allows state funding of pasture @-@ f@@ ences .
the goal is to keep the Black Forest .
the prerequisite is the presence of a subsi@@ dy specified by the L@@ PR .
in addition , the enclosed area should not be poor ( slope inclin@@ ation above 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by the aff@@ or@@ estation .
for the Fischer@@ bacher wil@@ low fence project 2018 , the application of eight participants with 24 par@@ c@@ els , which would like to build nearly 16 kilometres fence , is currently underway .
the accounting area corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 1@@ 12@@ ,000 euros .
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tru@@ mp sees the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
Americans like these as well as any other - therefore the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ os Square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tru@@ mp Regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated argument with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CN@@ N on the president &apos;s proposals to dras@@ tically restrict legal migration to the Statue of Liberty .
to stay fair , Miller was not attacking the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of boat owners and liberty @-@ im@@ it@@ ators would have smooth@@ ed him if he had done it .
but he reached its significance , and in particular the importance attributed to it , when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903 , 17 years after the monument was completed , was added to its base .
when Miller bought A@@ co@@ sta , &quot; I don &apos;t want to go down here for a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illumin@@ ates the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the poem you refer to , which was later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller is fac@@ tually correct , but as he formulated it , it is not really about history .
it is about the contem@@ por@@ aneous response to the vibr@@ ating words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your we@@ ary , your poor , / your oppressed masses , who y@@ earn to breathe freely , the mis@@ erable rub@@ b@@ ish of your rich coasts . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a time when the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; el@@ emental waste &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on our screens was better to see . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Tru@@ mp@@ s USA .
this conflict because of the meaning of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural conflict : it is indeed a conflict about the meaning of America .
Lazarus - and her friends who started to place her words on the basis after her death - knew very well that she had completed a highly political story .
the sculpture was to show the connections between French and American rep@@ ublic@@ anism by portra@@ ying the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn @-@ out classic portra@@ yal .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she gives herself a quite different name : mother of ex@@ iles .
the combination of the poem with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist coup and a devastating attack on the American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just as Lazarus was changing the meaning of the statue , the people of the right wing wanted to change it for a long time .
the great cry of R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tru@@ mp , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anyone but rather an early Ne@@ o@@ conservative to bring the American flame to the world &apos;s um@@ nach@@ ted world : &quot; Lady Liberty is going on .
it should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the torch should not enligh@@ ten the way to the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rather unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh here something start@@ led .
the meaning of the statue is quite a question of the standpoint of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative deed of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted , el@@ eventh , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible journeys on the deck of ships .
it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear .
and that is , of course , not the perspective that Miller and Tru@@ mp ever want to recognize .
their torch should not enligh@@ ten the way , but ign@@ ite the hatred that is their only source of power .
world Championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black praised Scottish members of the UK Team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two Sc@@ ots were part of the team of Great Britain
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance director of the United Kingdom &apos;s athle@@ tics track , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 member cont@@ ingent of the world championship leader will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which ki@@ cks off on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Scotland there is something special developed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the United Kingdom &apos;s athle@@ tics &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; athle@@ tics &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has to learn something from it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find it out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think there is something to do with what they have done . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish ath@@ lets think there is something to do with what they have done .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type at the corner of the road .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are med@@ als candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ tier@@ - competing against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5000 m track , while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was chosen by the team captain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is rather modest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h brought in quite naturally were great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth Silver medal winner , which will compete at its fifth world champion@@ ships at the 400 m hur@@ d@@ les , says it is &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British squ@@ ad .
Scotland &apos;s best total of athletes at the World Championship has been seven , which have been reached in 1983 and 2015 .
the middle distance runner Mu@@ ir carries on this road and last year has set five British and two European records .
it will take part at the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ s@@ man to watch for a great season , which included the victory in the British Team Tri@@ als and Anni@@ versary Games .
Do@@ yle appeals to her first World Championships when the only other Scot@@ s@@ man in Team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell was .
the team captain says that they are &quot; enormously proud &quot; about the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots do not only belong to the team , but in some cases also be involved with med@@ als and the fin@@ als .
&quot; being special about team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honor anyway , but knowing that my te@@ amm@@ ate colleagues voted for me and chose me , makes it something very special for me , &quot; she added .
&quot; obviously I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots that belong to the team .
it shows only how far we have come .
and they are here as well @-@ established athletes , athletes , who want to climb to Po@@ dium .
what about my speech as captain ?
yes , I think she went well .
I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home champion@@ ships .
so it is really important to rely on this kind of home support and benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I get a second chance to go out and compete there and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
blocking Cri@@ tics on Facebook : do not concern yourself with a public office if you cannot tolerate the he@@ als of voters
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington but it didn &apos;t take long until the newspapers hit him because of everything , from domestic politics to his political principles .
he kno@@ cked at the cri@@ tique , sure .
but he did not silence his critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for in 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and mu@@ te , we are led like sheep to slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this brings me to Mary@@ land Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry H@@ og@@ an , who has to work to be more like Washington .
Ho@@ g &apos;s employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their views on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union was therefore accused of it at the beginning of this week .
the Gover@@ nor &apos;s staff dismissed the complaint as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online comment was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said many people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is important .
and it is particularly important if it is a type like H@@ og@@ an .
this is a republi@@ can governor in an over@@ power@@ ing democratic state that is amaz@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest consent of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a reactionary heat head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his State and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very sk@@ il@@ ful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and to end his ha@@ iry head after chemotherapy on his side .
therefore the blocking of persons coming to the Gover@@ nor &apos;s side - which is a public forum that is designated as official and of employees paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gans spokes@@ woman A@@ mel@@ ia Ch@@ asse defended the acts of the governor and argued that blocking the commentary was nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it is too easy to use the image of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or hat@@ eful people sw@@ inging online the whi@@ p .
the post talked to some of the real people that were blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
and these are only genuine people speaking with their chosen leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a pastor , no troll@@ s .
they all said that their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful and not professional .
the pastor rec@@ ited the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gans Catholic faith .
Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not hat@@ eful , but she asked for hate crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I commented cour@@ te@@ ously that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other news , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote in the commentary area of the news broadcast &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t really appreciate this idea when a number of people take a stand on the same theme , then they are ignored by some rather than a so @-@ called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what the staff of the governor described as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated spam @-@ attack &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would probably call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interc@@ ession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or del@@ eting a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in previous times when you have done the same that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical articles or to arrest and silence demonstr@@ ators .
but that &apos;s exactly what happens digit@@ ally .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public official to critic@@ ise Facebook and other social media .
President Tru@@ mp is accused of Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this issue was last week in Virginia .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of Lou@@ dou@@ n County finally injured the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to U.S. District Jud@@ ge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when she banned a vot@@ er from her Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky Gou@@ verne@@ ur Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit to the AC@@ L@@ U because of his use of Facebook and Twitter .
it should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington , the time of the affordable car had a similar effect as the internet .
the number of newspapers multiplied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letters sm@@ ashed to his leadership .
and even then , Washington had anonymous troll@@ s .
the people who used pseud@@ ony@@ ms such as &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ e@@ tius , &quot; wrote letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions .
peti@@ tions , which critici@@ zed his position on the contract of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with Britain , overwhel@@ med his ministry , according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of George Washington Project .
but he did not silence her .
freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses are part of our nation .
and true guidance means accepting this .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance club
the former European No 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for domestic comfort over the next three days , since the Renaissance club in East Lo@@ thi@@ an hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who held up to the final round in the Arch@@ er@@ field right next year , before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador on behalf of the club founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ vad@@ i .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how it achieves its fame with this event , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; players will see this course from its best side , it &apos;s in a great condition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jer@@ ry made a great job when he set up this place .

&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a great showcase for this course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Engli@@ sh@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , even though he won the European Tour as well as the European Challenge Tour in his 32 @-@ year career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this really feels special , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the player headquartered in South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I couldn &apos;t defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dura Open because it was taken out of the program in the year after winning it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories of last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win last year here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a really special time and one that we always appreciate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50@@ th birthday this year , returns to the action on his home ground .
this event will be his first Scottish show since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it always means a bit more when you &apos;re playing at home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this additional pressure .
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am happy about how far it has gone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

less lung cancer due to passive smoking
over the past two decades , fewer and fewer people have died due to passive smoking in lung cancer .
scientists at the University Medical Center Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( UK@@ E ) come to this conclusion in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 167 pul@@ mon@@ ary deaths per year are attributable to passive smoking , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison , he drew up his own study on this subject since 1994 .
at that time , there were still 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking per year in Germany .
the new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health .
domestic connections prove to be very complex
the construction works at the Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and &quot; are somewhat in time , &quot; says the director of the building yard Fred Hein@@ ze .
in the area of the house connections , the situation is more complicated than suspected , as there is a lot of hiding in the underground , which is not mentioned in the plans .
traffic , which continuously obstruc@@ ts the construction work , is a big problem for the construction of the company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ignorance of mot@@ ori@@ sts from red lights and barriers is already enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road is closed and only the regular buses are allowed for passage .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Kost@@ or@@ z and Tim Kost@@ or@@ z of St@@ ump@@ p company have been working on the bridge for weeks .

poverty and death in the Indonesian gold@@ lands
when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i cook dinner , she doesn &apos;t use a stove .
it rarely uses a pot .
in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai regi@@ ment in the rest@@ less in@@ don@@ es@@ ian province of Papua , the house@@ wife usually puts a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace .
after half an hour the char@@ coal dust is removed with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands and swal@@ lowed .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay soil - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , e.g. to wash dresses with clou@@ dy water from the nearby mar@@ sh .
a bucket in a roof@@ less room serves as lat@@ rine .
as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , her fields were not assigned to her .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course late to work can be dangerous : most vill@@ agers are unemployed , and many drink heavily , and there are the soldiers here .
&quot; nobody dar@@ es to run around in the village after 17 o &apos;clock , &quot; she says .
it is a rare insight into daily life in the high@@ lands of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was taken up in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders were to be voted by a public lifting system in front of the occup@@ ying troops .
an existing movement , which arose for independence against the Dutch rule , quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains control over the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal ob@@ servers .
in 2003 the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua , whereby the independent part of Papua New Guinea became the eastern part of the island .
the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive by car .
there is no public transport .
the city of about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses , which are surrounded by bam@@ boo @-@ f@@ ences and from corrugated iron roofs , which were transformed by rust into various yellow @-@ brown tones .
very few Indonesian have made their journey here , let alone journalists and practically no foreigners .
before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans honored a god called U@@ ga Tam@@ ar .
there were other changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we weren &apos;t used to wearing these clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and points to her bright , hand @-@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright skir@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , we had only leaves on our bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Papua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst mort@@ ality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Bali &apos;s Gold@@ land .
the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gr@@ ass@@ berg , owned by Phoenix Mc@@ Mor@@ an , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high @-@ land province of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Free@@ port has broken gold and copper in the value of 3.1 billion US dollars .
in addition , Papua on wood resources has valued at an estimated 78 billion US dollars .
these riches , however , are a source of misery for the State of Papua , which ensure that Indonesia &apos;s em@@ power@@ ing military maintains a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence .
a 2005 study in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port paid close to $ 20 million between 1998 and 2004 , including up to $ 15@@ 0,000 in one single officer .
Pap@@ u@@ an demands for greater autonomy thre@@ aten those golden go@@ ose and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
according to information from activists , more than 500@@ ,000 have been killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed , tor@@ tured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969 .
mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s tribal high@@ land in the 1970 &quot; s became genocide according to the Asia @-@ based Human Rights Commission .
in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year .
&quot; we Wer@@ den All Ver@@ lieren , &quot; in a report from the dioc@@ ese of Bris@@ ban@@ e from 2016 , in which reports on atro@@ cities of the previous year are included , such as illegal exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electric strikes are particularly popular following another report - and the brutal defeat of peaceful demonstrations .
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims since incidents occur every week , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch .
the screws have increased since Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic development is changing since Muslim economic migrants come from the densely populated islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ an@@ ese waiting cant@@ e@@ ens sell fried chicken and g@@ ado @-@ g@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce served .
local people fight to keep up with it .
&quot; migrants have begun to sell chi@@ ckens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than local Papua , &quot; explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai native who moved to the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has ta@@ sted the native Papua - the Mama @-@ Mama &#91; the women &#93; from Papua - their market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Indonesian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , known in the Volk@@ sm@@ und as Jok@@ ow@@ ai , promised to address the ine@@ qualities and legal violations in Papua throughout his campaign in 2014 .
the former carp@@ enter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Papua little has changed , and today the natives feel betra@@ yed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts were broken , because we agreed in 2014 for Jok@@ ow@@ i , with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice is restored , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says You . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is initiation in October .
on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children was outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle .
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should turn on their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers took an impulse to their tone and later returned with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ edt T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk , hun@@ ted and beat the group with their ri@@ f@@ le pist@@ ons , said victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
one child , 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ uli@@ o , was so badly beaten that he fell into coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire , and things escal@@ ated the next day .
around 1,000 young Papua men , women and children gathered on a football ground in front of the local police station and the Military Command Centre to demand justice .
they carried cerem@@ onial hunting gu@@ sts and performed the Wa@@ ita dance - running in a circle and im@@ itating a bird song - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators started throwing stones at police and military posts .
when the mood was heated up , the soldiers were sent a command over an internal funk : &quot; if the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; says it in an official document of TI@@ ME , which was not released to the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ams , 56 , head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto four@@ quarter of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the im@@ min@@ ent danger and called for peace and asked the crowd to return home .
nobody was listening in the mood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot into my left wrist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on the ver@@ and@@ ah of his multic@@ ol@@ ored wooden house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kay@@ ams still doesn &apos;t know who fired , but says that the bul@@ let came from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he adds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ ve was hit three times , so his cous@@ in , who was the witness of the shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure that he was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who as many Indon@@ esi@@ ans only bears a name , the TI@@ ME in glo@@ omy atmosphere . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief inspec@@ tor of the Papua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , re@@ porters said that his officers wanted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their station because they were attacked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to defend ourselves when people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Papua police , Commissioner P@@ ud@@ jo Su@@ li@@ sti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about life and death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others were injured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the news about the kill@@ ings came &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; filtered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the following day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Jak@@ arta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three weeks ago , Jok@@ ow@@ i in Jay@@ ap@@ ura gave a passionate speech in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and sw@@ elled to address the historical ab@@ uses in Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be solved immediately so that it will not happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; security Minister Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 that he set up an extra@@ judicial mechanism for the settlement of historic human rights violations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the exc@@ uses started almost immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the injuries have occurred long ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed to tackle these violations , but there are processes that need to go through , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then Haman made a retreat when he spoke to TI@@ ME on 5 June in Jak@@ arta , saying that he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the indictment , which the UN charged with crimes against humanity , called for more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody independence vote in 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights violations had already been settled in Papua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident .
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims received such claims with a gri@@ m un@@ belief .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am tired . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he says that he still lives in fear for years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am afraid , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am afraid to be arrested by the military , afraid of being shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us rec@@ alled that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were afraid to discuss the incident .
he says that he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four of the victims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after I had buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military looked for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police fired vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood of Dei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confrontation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a construction company who refused to bring a unconscious man to the hospital , one person died and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drow@@ ned when he was fishing in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .
excited village residents prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s location office .
the police said that the vill@@ agers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warnings .
but locals say that the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade ( Indonesian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began shooting on the crowd and killed one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we were afraid that there will be ven@@ ge@@ ance , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the wounded were quickly delivered here , &quot; said the TI@@ ME .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have hidden for two days in my house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai Parliament called on the officers to take account of the officers involved and withdraw the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade from the territory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pan@@ i@@ ai was always an inv@@ ocation for the Indonesian government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ content of the tribal people Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al who live in the green high@@ lands of Papua .
many joined the &quot; Free Off movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army that claims to defend the rights of Papua by increasing spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings by Indonesian soldiers .
some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , among them T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ den Kog@@ o@@ ya .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai have been arrested and arbitr@@ arily taken into custody , under the pre@@ text of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; securing national sovereignty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some never dive again .
among the people of Papua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty strengthens dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice that is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as out of reach .
people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and vegetables and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women , each of which can work four or five fields of sweet potatoes .
they retain most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indonesian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) .
in the course of time , economic ine@@ qualities have grown between the native Papua and the new migrants who have arrived in larger numbers since the inauguration of new flight routes to the Nab@@ ire airport .
the few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better educated and aff@@ lu@@ ent migrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Papua people rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to compete with their own businesses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there is no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ i , chairman of the Pan@@ i@@ ai family council .
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far off from Papua .
in addition , restrictions on reporting international media remain ten@@ se .
at the beginning of the year French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ die and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua , although the rare permit for filming was given to them .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ o &apos;s election campaign , which raise restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development , have not been realised .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia &apos;s troubled eastern provinces of Papua and West Papua : visa refusal and a black@@ list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely confined to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March , six paci@@ fic states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; different and widespread injuries &quot; in Papua , including Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting .
the same countries have historically been supported by the O@@ PM .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r rejected the accus@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system , and there are free media so it is difficult to cover the evidence for human rights cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
local people want more foreign governments to take note of this .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , headed by the human right ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , visited Jay@@ ap@@ ura on May 4 , local people broke their silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also participated in the session , but would like to remain anonymous .
Indonesia has a further presidential election in 2019 , but the Ukra@@ inians say they will probably not vote again for Jok@@ ow@@ i .
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people involved in the pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; says Gob@@ i , the chairman of the Board of Directors .
he wants the Pan@@ i@@ ai people to know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from the fact that it lives under the constant threat of a pre@@ dat@@ ory military , is in poor educational and health services .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gob@@ i says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Papua , consider their vote to Jok@@ ow@@ ai as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blame &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which he has to pay back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite threats and intim@@ id@@ ations , the families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims filed a last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the dead body of a victim was buried in an area exactly opposite the police and the military station .
they know they may never give justice to them , but at least they will not forget those responsible for their crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with his head . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest residential towers in the world in Dubai and forced hundreds of inhabitants to flee from the 3@@ 37 metre high , 79 @-@ storey building .
it is the second fire that swe@@ eps through the high @-@ rise in just two years , which is usually called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( torch @-@ tower ) .
the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up at the fire alarm and at the scre@@ aming of the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50@@ th floor , &quot; said an inhabit@@ ant who called his name as George An@@ ab , Reu@@ ters .
Dubai &apos;s civil protection authorities said that fire fighting units were extingu@@ ishing fire at 4.@@ 00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 clock GMT ) and the building cooled .
the government said it was working on providing accommodation for those affected .
the incident can revi@@ ve questions on the safety of materials used in the field of sky@@ scra@@ pers around the world .
an examination by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damages came from the covering , the outer covering for decoration or insulation .
in Britain , the police said that the system of plates for insulation and facing at the London Gren@@ fell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in June , with about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup reform : next Best @-@ of @-@ five
the president of the International tennis association ( IT@@ F ) has gone through with his great Davis Cup @-@ Cou@@ p at the Annual General Meeting .
at the Ho @-@ Chi Min@@ h City meeting , the proposal for this sport , Davis Cup auf@@ zel , was only to be played on two raff@@ les , but not supported by the required two @-@ thirds majority .
ad@@ mitt@@ edly very long , but also therefore very estimated five @-@ set classics remain the traditional competition .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 percent of the member states voted for the reform , the aim of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ el@@ ty was therefore scar@@ c@@ ely missed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our member nations will not have accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change in order to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historic competitions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ el@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you will continue to work on improving the application .
not only for the vote was the proposal , after many calls , to fill the final in a neutral place .
new from 2018 is only comparatively small details : the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will have the host right in the next round of the next round .
in order to reduce costs for the event organisers , the requirements regarding training places etc. will be facilit@@ ated and players will have to complete fewer official media appointments in front of the Davis Cup .
more than 1 out of 5 US travelers bring forbidden objects into the aircraft , find out a survey
a survey among air passengers showed that more than 20 per cent consciously or un@@ intentionally forbidden objects were smu@@ g@@ gled at the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , among them at least 6 percent who entered the aircraft , while they acci@@ dentally bore false knives or other objects with blades .
less than 1 percent claimed they had later discovered that they were mistakenly travelled with guns , amm@@ unition , or explo@@ sives .
the survey of more than 1,000 people , carried out by a jet charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Charter , Inc . , also noted that younger travellers rather dis@@ regard the rules .
among those sur@@ vey@@ ed that they know@@ ingly tried to fly with something banned by the T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 percent mill@@ enni@@ als were compared to less than 15 percent , which were members of Generation X .
the most common items that were deliberately passed by T@@ SA agents were foodstuffs and liquids .
more than 3 per cent said to have know@@ ingly carried articles with blades by security control , while 2.2 percent of the female respon@@ dents and 3.@@ 7 percent of the male sur@@ vey@@ ed also confirmed that they had deliberately forbidden drugs into the aircraft .
the company said it asked travellers all over the country to find out how many acci@@ dentally had smu@@ g@@ gled goods through airport security and as many had deliberately done .
it is no surprise that people who are most often smu@@ g@@ gled - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - carry them through safety , those who are most often flying .
however , the company points out that the T@@ SA directives are somewhat complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often uncertain what fluids they may take with or how much of it .
so it is no surprise that the largest amount of items conf@@ isc@@ ated by the T@@ SA are liquids banned from the T@@ SA .
for a while the people thought that the T@@ SA could see books as smu@@ g@@ gled goods .

electric @-@ Taus@@ dri@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k enjoys with the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
in doing so , he has hitherto suggested that part of the client has already withdrawn its non @-@ binding reservation .
in addition to the always trium@@ phant earnings to increase revenue and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la leader El@@ on Mus@@ k , for the first time , revealed another , less brilliant figures for the first time : the cancell@@ ations received at the new mass market model 3 .
over the past few months , Mus@@ k has frequently had more than 500@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose ex@@ tradition is just beginning .
now , Mus@@ k ad@@ mits : 6@@ 3,000 had already been re@@ trac@@ ted by the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders .
critics have repeatedly pointed out that it is merely a non @-@ binding reservations .
in case of cancellation , Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( in the US $ 1000 USD and in Britain 1000 pounds ) &quot; booking payment . &quot;
at the moment 45@@ ,000 of such non @-@ binding reservations envis@@ age , Clean up Mus@@ k at a telephone conference with analysts .
however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe that the cancellation of about twelve percent of all orders could become a problem .
his argument : the challenge of ambitious growth targets is not on demand , but on the production site .
last year , Tes@@ la delivered 8@@ 4,000 cars .
by 2018 , all models will be taken together - 500@@ ,000 are to be one million by 2020 .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k , 1800 bookings are made per day .
who orders a &quot; Model 3 &quot; today can expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tes@@ la manages to drive its brand @-@ new , never in practice production lines without larger interrup@@ tions with maximum capacity utilization .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
but if it comes to greater delays , then the liability of the reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la .
because then the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from running off in dro@@ ves .
EPA chief P@@ ru@@ itt re@@ jects the Obama @-@ Er@@ a rules to reduce emissions
one day after being accused of 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , head of the Environmental Protection Authority , with@@ drew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era in order to reduce emissions of smoke @-@ causing pollut@@ ants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change when his agency proved to meet the needs of the state environmental authorities more responsive to previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the complaint which had been raised against his previous passage in a Federal Court of Appe@@ al .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a deadline that expi@@ red on October 1st for States to comply with o@@ zone standards for 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would post@@ p@@ one the observ@@ ance of a year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid interfer@@ ing with local decisions or im@@ pe@@ de economic growth . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was prosec@@ utor of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma before his appointment was appointed by President Donald Tru@@ mp , was a long time a reliable opponent of strict environmental regulations .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly failed to block or delay regul@@ ators , resist@@ ing the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels .
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the most recent legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ ff regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ al in Washington decided that the EPA administrator passed its authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration , which required oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leak@@ age .
in a statement issued on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt proposed that his revers@@ al in o@@ zone standards is simply the willingness of the EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under previous administr@@ ations , the EPA has often failed to comply with the deadlines for implementation and is then waiting to be accused by groups of activists and others , and in an agreement to set the date for implementation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who accused the EP@@ O more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation by court proceedings , and we take fri@@ c@@ ents seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the Law and the Authority we give to us seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless the opinion of the EPA that P@@ ru@@ itt at some point will use his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; authority for delay and all other legally available thorou@@ gh@@ fare &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure that the regulations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are based on a sound policy and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in Congress press for a more comprehensive revision of the o@@ zone rules .
a bill approved last month shall delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .
the measure was not yet to be voted in the Senate .
the New York General At@@ tor@@ ney General Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the Coalition of the States , who had su@@ ed the EPA in this week , said the group inten@@ ding to maintain legal pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conversion of EPA - according to our complaints - is an important gain for the health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g that flows into their communities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schneider . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new York joined California , Connec@@ tic@@ ut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , O@@ reg@@ on , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil @-@ o@@ zone is produced when pollut@@ ants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources react to sunlight .
the resulting smo@@ g can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people , and each year contributing to thousands of premature deaths .
representatives of public health and environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered on P@@ ru@@ ff &apos;s surprising change of course .
&quot; it is disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this sensible step from the responsible for the protection of the air we inhal@@ e , &quot; said Lor@@ i An@@ n Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Divers@@ ity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue to fight against the ideological Crus@@ ade of the Tru@@ mp government to address environmental contam@@ in@@ ants and their particular interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tum@@ ours Celeb@@ rates 750 Years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the Berg@@ kirche , the old cemetery area in Tum@@ bes will be invited to a seren@@ ade on Sunday , July 16 at 16.@@ 30 .
whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historical St. Hil@@ arius plant is a popular place to stay .
visitors to the sixth Bene@@ fi@@ z seren@@ ade can be en@@ chanted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and sponsors of tum@@ ours to their concerns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Walter Mart@@ ini emphasizes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a unique village jewel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 12@@ 67 the St. Hil@@ arion chapel was first mentioned in records in the Wu@@ ert@@ tem@@ berg Docum@@ entation book : Graf Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the parish church of Tum@@ fingen and the Vog@@ tland &quot; at Magi@@ ster Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver .
according to the wording of the document , on the Tum@@ our hill , except for the former parish church , there was also a noble court belonging to which the church or the patron was right and not vice versa .
so there were also people there .
as from the description of the Freuden@@ stadt Ober@@ amt , dating back to 18@@ 58 , it was next to the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which are still visible today in the town@@ scape of tum@@ ors , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the noble settlement nucle@@ us of the village .
old maps of the period around the year 1600 all confirm these historical facts .
the right of pat@@ ron@@ age arose from the early medieval church law .
a master who built a church and occupied with a pastor remained the owner of this church and could also bequ@@ e@@ ath@@ ed this church .
associated with this was the right to appoint a pastor or to propose a new pastor to the bishop .
there were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the Gre@@ at@@ est of the two were destroyed in 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell sounded for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be handed over later during the Second World War in 1942 .
in the Thi@@ r@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the windows were ham@@ mer@@ ed and the bells were stolen .
the roof was leak@@ y .
in 17@@ 96 , French troops camped near the church .
they broke out the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
remains of the church threatened in 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 the tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery was also used as the last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schwei@@ ler .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was expanded and the Hil@@ arion church was demoli@@ shed .
only the church tower could be stopped .
during the New Year &apos;s Eve 18@@ 34 a storm broke the bell tower and half collap@@ sed .
in order to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demoli@@ shed .
only the tower @-@ tower still existing today was preserved as a witness of the 750 @-@ year @-@ old church history .
today Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em maintain the Hil@@ arius plant as the successor of Dieter Dock@@ horn .
the organisers invite the friends and sponsors of Tum@@ ours on Sunday , July 16 , for the sixth seren@@ ade at the old cemetery for St. Hil@@ arion chapel .
it is designed by the Com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium Freuden@@ stadt and with words by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the local &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speaks the closing word . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the program begins at 16 : 30 pm .
admission is from 3 : 30 pm .
a drink takes place in front of the grav@@ eyard for the seren@@ ity of the seren@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organizers take out the fantastic view . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the seren@@ ade occurs only in dry weather .
the organisers hope for many supporters to preserve the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant , which is of importance to tum@@ ors and hear@@ ers .
friends and sponsors of Tum@@ lin@@ s feel particularly committed to the care of their homeland , such as Ser@@ en@@ ade organis@@ er Walter Mart@@ ini re@@ affir@@ med .
association wants to permit authorisation of wind turbines
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim does not take any legal requirements for construction and has therefore turned to the coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim we@@ ars off &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has asked Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to take back his permit for the construction of planned wind turbines in Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is illegal .
the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 , no wind turbines could have been approved in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette , as at the time in Vier@@ sen , only at the border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal , a wind power concentration zone existed .
within this concentration zone construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes the exclusion of wind power utilization for the rest of the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such zones are intended to prevent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spar@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the landscape . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the city of Vier@@ sen had a second wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette a few days earlier , but it did not appro@@ ve the district government of Düsseldorf because of a formula .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planning legal requirements , the granted permission is still illegal and therefore also to be taken back &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , chairman of Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot; &quot; &quot;
current state of affairs : before the summer break , the city council again approved the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette ; a approval from the district government is still pending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is where the issu@@ ance of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is legally excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the receipt of the request .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letter has been received in the circle of Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared a spokesperson . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes it to the occasion to re @-@ examine the matter .
however , they do not expect the procedure to be stopped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday refused to comment on the argum@@ entation of the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim we@@ ars off &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the NEW re , a subsidiary of the NEW , plans to build four each 200 metres high wind turbines on an area at Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette .
last year , the company , in which the city of Vier@@ sen was involved , had concluded le@@ ases with the owner of the approximately 65 @-@ ac@@ re grounds .
with the construction of the four wind turbines , the electricity needs of some 11 400 households will be met - equivalent to roughly one @-@ fifth of the electricity needs of all four @-@ leg@@ ged households .
the NEW re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer , Vier@@ sens town council gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines in the Lin@@ ni@@ ch wind park near Aachen , as well as a participation in a wind turbine in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the Kreis Hein@@ sberg .
car and tractor crash together : woman dies with a terrible accident
a terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 a.m. on the L 3@@ 33 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was fat@@ ally wounded .
two more people were injured .
the state road remained closed for hours .
according to police instructions , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch with her passenger car took the L 3@@ 33 in the direction of Bo@@ gel with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother , accompanied by her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother .
&quot; &quot; &quot; city and dealer plan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; home shopping &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weekend &quot; &quot; &quot;
bad Lan@@ gen@@ heim and people from the region are to re@@ discover shopping in the city centre in September .
the commercial association and city administration plan to use the weekend on September 8th and 9th to l@@ ure the inhabitants of the city to the city centre .
as the chairman of the Gewerbe@@ verein , Christian König , announced , the &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend aims to sensi@@ ti@@ ze customers , which offers their own city outside of the usual supermarket goods .
therefore , a market with regional suppliers is planned , similar to the weekly market .
in addition , domestic companies should present themselves with their apprenticeship places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the shops of the city center will invite you to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; midnight shopping &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action not only aims at residents of the city and the near@@ er region .
in preparation , advertising spots on the radio , an internet video and printed bags that point to the action @-@ weekend , says Christian König .
the municipal administration and commercial association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
the Gewerbe@@ verein and the city thus enter a further stage of the project &quot; Attrac@@ tive inner city . &quot;
this includes new offers such as the first &quot; Active Day &quot; to Brun@@ nen@@ fest along with a Sunday , talks with all trade professionals and hosts to move them to active participation .
attractive offers on Saturday and the wai@@ ver of parking fees this day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer potentials are to be re @-@ opened or re @-@ opened .
this includes both spa guests and tourists .
but many locals also lost sight of the city centre when shopping .
in the end , everyone would have to contribute to en@@ li@@ ven the inner city - to land@@ lords , the companies of the whole city and clubs .
it was supposed to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network , which was partly wi@@ dened , König had said in the spring .
Birgit St@@ reich , head of the I@@ HK @-@ Center in Müh@@ l@@ hausen , stated that the third &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; day , for the first time , took part in five Thür@@ inger cities .
apart from Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ ero@@ de .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promote the appreciation of local trade and strengthen its significance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the action under the leadership of the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners also makes it clear that each citizen can have a direct influence on his purchasing behaviour . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two deaths and several wounded after an explosion at U.S. school
during construction work it was a gas explosion in the school building .
new other people were injured .
in a gas explosion in the U.S. city of Min@@ ne@@ apolis , two people were killed and nine more injured , some of them difficult .
according to the fire bri@@ g@@ ade , a wounded person was still in critical condition on Wednesday ( local time ) .
a man died when a part of a school building collap@@ sed during the explosion .
a first missing was later recovered later also dead .
in the case of the dead , they were employees of the school .
as a mis@@ chief , the authorities presum@@ ed to work on a gas pipeline .
during the holiday season there were only a few people in the building of the Min@@ neh@@ aha Academy .
Tru@@ mp continued after in@@ feed tran@@ scripts of telephone calls Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the boundary wall
tran@@ scription of telephone calls between US President Donald Tru@@ mp and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
on 27 January , Tru@@ mp called on the Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to to stop saying that he would not pay for a planned border wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the US President compl@@ ained him because he publicly den@@ ounced the wall . he said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t tell the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tru@@ mp started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall at the southern border of the USA , and s@@ wore to let Mexico pay for the project .
tran@@ scripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also released and revealed an intense exchange .
Mr. Tru@@ mp told Mr. Turn@@ bull that a trade for the US refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia would be &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; &quot; bad &quot; and &quot; stupid &quot; and that the insist@@ ence on the trade that was given by the Obama administration would look like a &quot; dump@@ ster &quot; after he had proposed a ban on the reloc@@ ation of refugees to the United States .
Mr. Tru@@ mp finished the call after Mr Turn@@ bull announced , &quot; This is the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot;
Mo@@ ore Ford massacre : activists run rac@@ ist ly@@ n@@ ching act as a call for justice
a 1948 @-@ year @-@ old Ford Mer@@ cury came across a group of spectators in the Mon@@ roe , Georgia , and shr@@ unk to the Ford @-@ Bridge of Mo@@ ore .
before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver to reach the bridge , a group of white men with ri@@ fl@@ es emerged to block his way .
the leader of the mo@@ bs - a middle aged man in a needle strip suit - took a long train on his cig@@ ar and looked through the wind@@ shield .
inside the in@@ mates ho@@ vering in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man ro@@ ared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; get him out of the car ! &quot;
scre@@ aming broke the silence when a young black man was drag@@ ged from the passenger seat .
fortunately this terrible scene , which was played on July 22nd , is just a post .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; almost all of them hit very real si@@ ghs in the audience . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 , civil rights activists return to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night , in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com , and George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were ly@@ n@@ ched by K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one was ever accused of murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s really incredible that in all these years , no single person was arrested - although we see them in our communities , although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps in organizing the post @-@ delivery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a dirt stain on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former con@@ gres@@ s@@ man of Georgia and a life @-@ long civil rights activ@@ ist .
it serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ roe community that injustice has never been corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want criminal prosecution , we want the end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must obtain justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot achieve healing and reconciliation , until we receive justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a bai@@ li@@ ff presents a sheet about the cor@@ p@@ se of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ch on July 27 , 1946 .
according to the FB@@ I files obtained by the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ roe and the surrounding county were suspected in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process .
but none was ever accused .
although the susp@@ ects have been on the loose for decades , civil rights activists say that the double motivation for Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice enabled the black citizens of Georgia to vote for the first time in the summer election campaign .
about at the same time as the choice st@@ ach according to the FB@@ I the black color monitor Roger Mal@@ com has a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , while fighting - supposedly because of a woman .
Broo@@ ks said the ru@@ mor in the city was that H@@ ester had slept with Mal@@ com@@ s Mrs. Dor@@ othy and that the baby she wore did not come from her husband .
on 25 July 1946 Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white country owner , paid 600 dollars to liber@@ ate Mal@@ com from prison , such as the FB@@ I .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her cous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey .
but when they came from jail and approached the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car .
&quot; as it turns out , Har@@ rison , who prepared and arranged the kill@@ ings , &quot; concludes an FB@@ I report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also evident that there was a conspiracy between the state and local criminal prosecution , which was not only involved in the kill@@ ings , removing evidence and fal@@ si@@ fying the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks makes it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an electoral law massacre , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you register and if you vote , this will happen to you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for almost a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
her portra@@ yal is illustr@@ ative , gri@@ pping and based in a kind of profound racism , many of whom want to believe that he no longer exists in America .
it &apos;s hard to watch and look even more difficult , but Gre@@ ene said that &apos;s the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about Lyn@@ ching because we are confronted with his ug@@ liness in all of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I cannot establish a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or want to hear what I have gone through . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rehear@@ sals for this year &apos;s production started in June , and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen wh@@ ites and the rest of black - crowded into a room and listened when Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ rehear@@ sed overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is a co @-@ director here .
he has played the role of chief clan member for years , but he said the role will never be easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not that way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we do not want to return at these times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room rehear@@ sed the actor Dar@@ steller Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , their lines .
the piece begins with Mal@@ com , who cri@@ es cri@@ es and supp@@ resses it , fur@@ i@@ ously that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he , disappear of my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
An@@ cona ad@@ mits the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; asked Ras@@ cona .
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still smiling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just don &apos;t think white people at that time &apos; n &apos; he &apos; said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the other black actors ev@@ oc@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you just have to hit the hard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R. &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and precisely here the energy shifts in space , a feeling of compan@@ ion@@ ship replaces the discomfort .
everyone is busy doing this properly , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed humans .
the scene starts again .
this time , when Ras@@ cona is saying the N word , he says it sharply and with im@@ print .
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition ends violent and fast .
there are scre@@ ams , shots and then silence .
a woman clothed with a dream of grief , stands above the cor@@ p@@ ses of actors and performs Bil@@ lie Holidays &apos; mour@@ ning glory &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot;
her voice breaks with every second word .
about a hundred metres behind , a group of about four dozen people wi@@ pes sweat and tears from their eyes .
the audience is almost uni@@ form@@ ly divided between black and white .
a couple came from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come down just down the street .
they have experienced Geor@@ gi@@ as de@@ pressing humidity for almost eight hours , when Broo@@ ks walks her on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point , the mur@@ ders have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when you stand in the same country where the Lyn@@ ch kill@@ ings took place , the air feels like a gh@@ ost .
when the last notes of the song sound out , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the dead bodies .
children sit in their heads , record the fake blood and the silent body and whis@@ per each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mur@@ m@@ urs a little boy , as if he wanted to remember . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it &apos;s over .
the actors throw away the ly@@ n@@ ch rope and wipe off their tears .
Brad@@ sha@@ w embra@@ ces Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit , who played the clan member .
Nick Ras@@ cona embra@@ ces two of his fellow players and breaks together in their arms , the emotional load of the performance finally breaks with him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s okay &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we know that it is not in your heart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you have done it for a reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later the audience sat together with the actors for dinner .
at a table a white couple chat@@ ting from Atlanta promp@@ ting about the im@@ position with a black couple that they just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky fought to find out what feeling the performance left behind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to hear these terrible words and deeds ... to come from people who look like you and do that because they look like you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what really happens to me lets me believe that Lyn@@ ching is still going on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Today it is called police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks courtyard holds at his table , he eats and recalls the civil rights .
he said he began planning the performance next year .
&quot; the post @-@ delivery is in a way inspiring , as it describes the horror of what we endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is like we learn nothing from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is condemned to repeat it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ dämm@@ erung &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans in Bayreuth
in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf is focusing on a colourful and fri@@ vol@@ ous staging in front of a gigantic six @-@ storey setting .
the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by Alek@@ sand@@ ar Den@@ ic ) shows either a sh@@ ab@@ by street corner with the wall of the Wall and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ste and E@@ la@@ ste &quot; logo from the GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange .
before that , an open Mercedes classic car par@@ ked , in which the Rhine chi@@ ckens pose as rock erg@@ ir@@ ls , or alternatively a Is@@ etta .
st@@ acked oil barrels are reminiscent of Cast@@ or@@ f &apos;s leit@@ motif - money , power and gre@@ ed - which is moving through its &quot; Ring &quot; staging .
the three rh@@ k@@ ills - sung by Steph@@ anie Hou@@ tz@@ e@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ise as already in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold . &quot;
c@@ ess Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , drag a cor@@ p@@ se into the trunk in Hollywood @-@ style and enter the Kra@@ kow@@ o @-@ Cli@@ que .
Stephen Mill@@ ing sings the glori@@ ously nasty Hagen , which surrounds the aura of a heavy @-@ weight box@@ er .
brutal the scene when he bl@@ ames Siegfried .
later Gun@@ ther ( Markus oak ) still has to believe in it .
the audience would like to thank the ensemble with a strong appl@@ ause .
stor@@ my are fo@@ ster , Mill@@ ing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski who mo@@ dest@@ ly bows his hands to the Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te .
there is great appl@@ ause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows itself on stage for the first time - in light of the great heat in casual casual wear .
the appearance of Frank Cast@@ orf and his team of directors was eag@@ erly awa@@ ited .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2013 he had to have a conc@@ erto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trumpet concert &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about himself , there were five years later great jubil@@ ation , in which the scattered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boys &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls went down . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to have rejo@@ iced over this .
&quot; one notices that the audience has grown together with the &quot; Ring &quot; in a certain way , &quot; she said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa .
the public has not only made a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it also has grown an understanding of its view .
I draw a positive ré@@ sum@@ é .
Max quantity works as a volunteer
they work in their volunteer year at several locations .
where everywhere ?
quantity : usually in St@@ einf@@ urt in the furniture exchange , once a week I help out in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I worked at the school already in the open full day .
what are your experiences with it ?
quantity : it &apos;s a beautiful , wide spectrum that I see here .
I have to do with different people , with you@@ ths , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years , so a late @-@ called volunteer .
how does that come about ?
quantity : I made A @-@ Levels .
and then a civil engineer studies , let &apos;s say , successfully abor@@ ted .
I realized for myself that it is wrong for me and I want to do something different with people .
and then I asked myself what you do .
do a social year , there &apos;s an insight , there you can see how it is on the spot , at the focal point maybe also , really .
and was it that way ?
lot : I have collected great impressions .
in the winter semester , I will start my studies in social engineering .
I &apos;m going to study dual , probably make a social worker education in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne and study at the University of Applied Sciences in Ham@@ m .
isn &apos;t it un@@ common to have several different locations during volunteer service ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it always depends where you do your FS@@ J .
you can do it from the retirement home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work .
with me it was very varied .
I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care .
for me that was exactly what irrit@@ ated me .
I was able to see my own strengths and see how it really runs out .
different from Civil Engineering ?
quantity : well , here it is not about calculating stress .
you always have other people &apos;s head , each of which has a completely different story behind them .
whether a refugee , whether a teen@@ ager , who has been taken out of the family - you always have to respond to it individually .
very interesting .
and you didn &apos;t have reservations ?
quantity : I am not the guy .
it is an area that gives a lot .
great love , great kindness .
there are also negative moments , but life is just like that .
Pear@@ son cuts down another 3,000 jobs and cuts divi@@ den@@ ds to revi@@ ve business
the British training group Pear@@ son said on Friday that it will cut further 3,000 jobs and cut down their intermediate dividend by 72 percent , as another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure the company faces .
job reductions planned mainly by the General Director John Fall@@ on for the end of 2018 and early 2019 are in addition to its previous restructuring , in which already 4,000 positions have already been lost .
in May , Pear@@ son announced a third cost reduction plan to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ( $ 3@@ 94 million ) to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the rapid pace of digital learning .
the company , which had sold its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to Ber@@ tel@@ smann in the past month , said that the outlook for the financial year remained unchanged , after the first half of the year saw an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds .
con@@ vo@@ y attack by Kab@@ ul : NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ vo@@ y in the Afgh@@ an capital Kab@@ ul , killed a NATO soldier and injured several others , says officials .
five soldiers and one interpreter had been injured , shared a NATO Declaration .
according to local reports , three civilians died during the incident in the city district of Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h .
the bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan has hit this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at on Tuesday .
on Monday a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul .
in a NATO opinion it says that the explosion on Thursday night has happened when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by an impro@@ vised le@@ pro@@ sy carried by people . &quot;
the statement states that all injured are in a stable state and be treated at Bag@@ ram airport in the U.S. military hospital .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bag@@ ram .
according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian cas@@ u@@ alties in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % in the capital .
at the end of July , suicide bom@@ bers killed at least 30 people in a chi@@ ef@@ ly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul .
the Taliban said they had done this attack .
on May 31 , a massive bombar@@ d@@ ment in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the most deadly milit@@ ant attack in the country since the US @-@ led troops pushed the Taliban out of power in 2001 .
the violence under@@ lines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , because US President Donald Tru@@ mp is weighing up the number of U.S. forces supporting the military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that in recent weeks the suicide bom@@ bers in Kab@@ ul also have caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , their policies and in particular the call of President Ash@@ ra@@ f Gh@@ ani .
EPA revers@@ es decision to delay the smo@@ g rule by lam@@ ination
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has made a decision to delay the regulation of the government of Obama , according to which states are obliged to cur@@ b the emissions @-@ causing emissions . this took place one day after 15 states accused the agency because of the stri@@ de .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to advance the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ zone regulations 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and said that it shows the commitment of the agency to cooperate with states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and from responding to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA chief Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of EPA in June to determine the o@@ zone regulations in which pollut@@ ant emissions are to be measured in a part of the country in order to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year by October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with Colombia &apos;s district , filed suit on Tuesday and said the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tru@@ mp attempts to return a broad range of environmental claims imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that should boost economic growth , according to Tru@@ mp .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , efforts have spark@@ ed the set@@ backs of democr@@ ats and conservation groups who are worried about the effects of greater emissions on public health . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the website of the EPA states that breathing air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reduces lung function and can strengthen respiratory symptoms &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such as asthma . &quot; &quot; &quot;
public council wants common space
at the end , the decision was clear : in two counter@@ parts , the municipal council of floo@@ ds resol@@ ves the establishment of a community room in the future retirement home .
prior to the discussion there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the missing part of the property was signed , reported mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden .
although it will still take time until the area belonging to the church is owned by the church , there is no planning obstacle for the project to be st@@ em@@ ming from a private investor .
there is a discussion about a common room for this .
one of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor , it would provide a living space of approximately 55 square meters and an adjoining terrace with 70 square meters of space for a special price .
the administration and majority of the municipal council ho@@ vers to see such a common space not as a meeting place only for residents of the sen@@ iors of sen@@ iors , but openly into the community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example , the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kn@@ itting café &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made the round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision that has been decided by the provision of funds for the ongoing budget has been decided by means of funding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the construction is in the re@@ development area .
the establishment of a community room would be , as reported T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent eligible .
the proposal envis@@ ages that the investor sign@@ alizes that in this respect it is not possible to throw a bil@@ let between legs , to determine that both the sem@@ it@@ rail@@ er and the structure of the environment - which reduces the height and makes the construction more economical - would be possible .
need@@ less to say , not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer thinks , is this addition .
if it helps : it &apos;s unanim@@ ous that it will happen to the body .
it is not as easy as the common room .
Daniela &apos;s reputation refers to the many of his own buildings with which one does not move so well , but now I lean towards the common room out of the window , she says : &quot; I am very hard with it . &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger is definitely speaking for the common room - but absolutely against a municipal involvement .
it sees behind it a hidden subsi@@ dy to anyway wealthy or even foreign investors .
this is not the case , because with the acquisition of the area there is no allowance but I get a real counter@@ value , which is market@@ able in doubt , is the opposite .
Sta@@ ig@@ nier &apos;s motion to cut the resolutions accordingly , finds three advoc@@ ates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so it stays with two counter@@ parts of the original program called Stefan H@@ aller : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we take the decision , we make a huge step to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
collision with car : Rad@@ ler is thrown on the road
while crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycli@@ st was captured by a car in Gar@@ ath on Wednesday and badly injured .
as the police announced , the 82 @-@ year Lan@@ gen@@ felder was on the bike path of the road Schwar@@ zer Straße in the direction of Hil@@ den on the bike path of the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder on the bike path .
the senior wanted to cross the road in the height of the street Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
a passenger car driver , travelling in the same direction , will take preced@@ ence over him .
when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder went on the road , he obviously did not desp@@ ise the on@@ coming traffic .
he crashed into a car , which was driven by a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ ess .
the man was thrown into the street .
he suffered severe injuries and was transported to a hospital with a ret@@ ou@@ ching van .
FC Bayern München must reno@@ unce the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup takes place without him : David Al@@ aba has to leave the game against Dortmund .
with personnel worries the FC Bayern will be travelling to Dortmund for the first time in the new season .
seven professionals lack the title defender in the Super@@ cup against the Cup winner .
in front of the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 p.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) , personnel take care of the German Football record master Bayern München at Po@@ kal@@ ei@@ eger Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund .
coach Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti must also give up on David Al@@ aba in du@@ el with BV@@ B .
this confirmed the Italian on Friday .
in addition , the Mun@@ ch@@ men Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing .
An@@ cel@@ otti has made the physical condition and the missing balance in the game of his team for the five defe@@ ats in the past six trials .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most important point is the team &apos;s balance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; that was not good at last . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official duty play of the season .
football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the crew is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to play intellig@@ ently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who expects a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; difficult , intense game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights attracts the fans .
the game was sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spectators , distributed the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) on Friday .
hike in the resin of star to star
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Harz Mountains the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be created . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is planned by the observ@@ atory Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planet trail in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accommo@@ dates the visitor &apos;s need for information , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he connects nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance .
members want to set up boards along the planned route and inform about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a first phase until 2018 , the association is planning &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good @-@ to @-@ reach installations at five to six locations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
domestic demand : St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß und Sie@@ ber .
the information on the boards should be completed via the internet .
therefore , a good mobile network reception plays a role in the selection of the location .
accessibility is also a criterion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; later the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Star Path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be expanded by train . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the star path , the viewer experiences much worth knowing , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; the association declared .
in addition , they learned why stars would have different colors or why a star has more light than another although it was considerably far@@ ther away .
in which con@@ stellation you will find a selected star and when it is best to see .
the association has been operating the highest situated observ@@ atory in northern Germany since 2014 in the mountain village of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , the location in the heart of the Harz National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
frequently from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a Galaxy with naked eye can be seen clearly .
the Uni @-@ Stadt has been on the initiative of the Förder@@ verein Planet@@ arium Göttingen ( Planet@@ arium ) since 2003 on the initiative of the Förder@@ verein Planet@@ arium Göttingen .
starting from Geb@@ hard &apos;s Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet route with its stel@@ ae leads up to the H@@ ain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; off @-@ planet &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( community gli@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the stel@@ ae with the individual planets - including the dem@@ on degra@@ ded to the d@@ warf Planet - are positioned exactly at the distance and the scale of one to two billion .
the earth thus shr@@ inks to a ball of 6.5 milli@@ metres , while the sun measuring exactly 75 meters measures 70 centimet@@ ers .
the entire distance of the planet route is about four kilometres .
while the light from Sun to Plu@@ to takes about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
thus pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the cosmos .
the march to the next f@@ using star would take half a year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who were to stand in a collision course in order to stage the most exciting competition in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms at ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated World Box@@ ing Council Light@@ weight champion , went down the corridor to greet Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Box@@ ing Organisation super @-@ suspension weight champion .
after Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory through unanim@@ ous decision on the former four @-@ divisions World Champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time , both fighters are members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und list .
Gar@@ cia put out the right hand and said : &quot; how are you , Champion ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I wish you good luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 p.m. on ES@@ PN .
when the couple posed for photographs , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mas noted that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect scale . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a former heav@@ y@@ weight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I climbed for Bron@@ er &#91; to 140 lbs &#93; but I &apos;m not so big . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I want to come down on Light@@ weight .
and he must move on light weight &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
this is demanding the fans .
let &apos;s give them that . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko was right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
climate asked whether it should be on Pay @-@ per @-@ View , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko had to fight with a 135 pound debut this year ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also interests in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell after their lightweight title fight in the Forum on September 23 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this fight could take place in pay @-@ per @-@ view mode , because all fans asked for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia and later openly expressed himself to fight on the network offering the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can produce this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
Gar@@ cia said he valued Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; and he might participate in his Saturday fight .
but Lom@@ ach@@ enko held a generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he thinks the three @-@ fight champion from River@@ side looks very slow , I &apos;m sorry Mi@@ key ... you wanted the K@@ o out . &quot;
Gar@@ cia said the focus was to show impact , then boxes .
both said they could feel the momentum that built up for their own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the fight which must be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other struggle creates so much attention and excitement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I waited for the top fighters , and that &apos;s Mi@@ key . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will be a great fight . &quot;
four wounded after placing the tire
four persons were injured in an accident at the A@@ 7 on Thursday afternoon .
after initial information , the driver of an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira immediately lost control of his vehicle at 4.@@ 30 pm shortly before the end of the market .
the car hur@@ led right into the em@@ bank@@ ment where he over@@ turned and then stood on the roof in the green stri@@ pe .
the four in@@ mates - two adults and two children - were injured in the accident .
during the first supply of the injured by the rescue service , the A@@ 7 was closed to the north for about an hour , then traffic could be passed by the accident site on the left lane of the road .
For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; three @-@ chain works better &quot;
Andr@@ e Hoffmann is hoping for the 2 : 2 season op@@ ener against Braunschweig , that optim@@ ising the defense formation in Au@@ e points .
with the first game of the season , Andr@@ e Hoffmann was happy , with the result too , there were not the two opposite doors at 2 : 2 vs. Br@@ uns@@ wick .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was too much for two ad@@ versaries , and we have to watch even better in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the def@@ enses player from Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains the triple chain is to be further optimized .
and a gate after a ki@@ ck@@ off doesn &apos;t want to capture the For@@ tun@@ en anymore .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future it will be so that no one will stand on line next to Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will be able to cope better also with the experience in the preparation with the triple chain than with the four @-@ chain .
&quot; I don &apos;t even know how we will act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , &quot; because we have just in the three chain on the semi @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann players who can build well , &quot; Hoffmann said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prerequisite is , however , that we harmon@@ ise even better and we do not afford to make so many mistakes in construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course Hoffmann also goes to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but whether you can speak after a draw from a failed start does not know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance could be quite okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we have four points on Sunday and can concentrate on the cup , we will certainly be able to talk about a good start to the season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his trainer wanted nothing of this .
&quot; I judge the start into the season only after six to eight playing days , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who doesn &apos;t want to talk about an advantage over Au@@ e just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be interrupted pre@@ mat@@ urely for an accident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann that the players from Au@@ e might be even fres@@ her , as they would not have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against a career favorite in the bones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t know as 100 per cent as they are currently standing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the inner def@@ enders of Fort@@ una . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad@@ mitt@@ edly , the guests from the Rhin@@ eland will be an easy favourite on Sunday in the meeting at the finally ( almost ) finished stadium by Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we will swe@@ ep them away , only because we are entitled to come under the first six is stup@@ idity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S@@ wir@@ l , whose balance is quite positive in only a defeat against Au@@ e of nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga , which you have to beat in advance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains For@@ tun@@ as chief coach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; making such a statement would be arro@@ gant and arro@@ gant . &quot;
and so Funk@@ el wants to see his players on Sunday in no case .
new results of the Swedish Asyl@@ um Review Test published
the recent results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , which have undergone a new method for medical evaluation of their age , show that over 80 percent of the persons tested are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish Medical Association ( medic@@ in@@ al@@ k@@ et ) has started the tests last year .
during the asylum procedure , they should take a closer look at the app@@ rais@@ al of the age after the Swedish Migration Service ( Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et ) has been critic@@ ised for errors in the app@@ rais@@ al of the correct age of some refugees who were under age .
to date , Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et has sent 6,@@ 8@@ 80 cases to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 .
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were assessed as 18 or older , while in further 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency judged that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may be under 18 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results have been consistent over the past few months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see no big difference in the statistics of the past months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases in which the person was assessed than over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ er has lied about his age .
in May the Agency released 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases that &quot; propose that the person being studied is 18 years or older . &quot;
when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bla@@ det was investigating the 5@@ 81 results published , she noted that in 24@@ 3 of these cases the person had openly stated that she will be 18 years old this year .
the method of medical age assessment , when X @-@ ray images of wisdom teeth and MRI images of knee joints are made , which are then analyzed by dentists and radi@@ ologists , has also been critici@@ zed in some areas .
a scep@@ tic is the en@@ doc@@ rin@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute whose work includes the evaluation of the biological ri@@ pen@@ ess of humans to see if they went sooner or later than usually through pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
judging the biological age in this way is very uns@@ af@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we cannot safely say it , we should not pret@@ end that we could , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the newspaper Metro . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Gö@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of being in@@ correctly judged by a child as an adult is minimal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest risk is when the person is under 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
working fully in the plan
the work on the three bridges on the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg is proceeding well .
on Wednesday a weigh@@ ted concrete section was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good at the time , it runs great , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , construction manager at the Department of Construction and Transport in the Regierung@@ sprä@@ si@@ dium Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in April , the work began at the same time on all three rehabil@@ itated bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the building is scheduled for October and Lei@@ cht is sure that the schedule will be respected .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads across the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is an arch bridge made of concrete , covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 meters .
it was built in 1900 .
like the other two bridges , it has now come into the years .
to ensure stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly re@@ structured .
the other two bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10,@@ 60 metres long .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach has now received a 1.@@ 30 metre wide and seven tons weigh@@ ted bridge cap on Wednesday morning on the north side .
this is a marginal fixing , which is also used as operating path .
on the southern part of the bridge , a bridge cap of 2.@@ 20 metres wide is to be used on Friday .
then the pedestrian walk@@ way is to run .
the special thing is that these are finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps .
a special feeling of t@@ act has required the laying of cables through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable , to which many companies are connected .
the residents were informed about the project in advance of the work .
in addition , fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be f@@ ished off first .
for the bridges between the building yard and the Flat@@ bre@@ ather in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is governed by a traffic light .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach town entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tann@@ en@@ hof &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is fully closed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost of the three weigh@@ ting stations is 700 000 euros .
the whole thing is financed through the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ under Protest with German potato salad
it is not so common that parties pull together , but when it comes to the Alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , it comes together , which is otherwise difficult to reconci@@ le .
the parties ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Left ) belong to a broad alliance that shows a peaceful flag this day because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle encourages the &quot; great campaign launch &quot; in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle .
and familiar names start - as Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land forms the leading duo for the German elections on September 24 , and Deputy Chairman of the Federal President Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are on @-@ the @-@ spot hours before the event begin , do not want to listen to the Af@@ D speakers but demonstrate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Eifel stays colourful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally the city picnic under the slogan &quot; All at a table &quot; was planned at the Brun@@ nen@@ hof , but now takes place on the parking lot below the r@@ ond@@ ola - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stadthalle .
a colorful picture that is there .
and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , chair@@ woman of the forum A world and one of the leading organizers , is really happy : &quot; great , how many people came together here . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is music and lots of food , including an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; original German potato salad , which the Af@@ D could eat easily , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him along . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police have ordered many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , showing presence especially at the railway station , which is only a few metres away from the venues .
how did the Af@@ D actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario LIN@@ pe reports about the Af@@ D Vulkan@@ ei@@ fel , who tried to make such an event and received the supplement .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us church there are not enough parking spaces available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now the R@@ ond@@ ell , the hom@@ es@@ ake is pleased that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
looking at the event on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ vor@@ platz , he says : &quot; this is the good right of the people , the main thing , it stays peaceful . &quot;
this is also done : around 8@@ pm on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ vor@@ platz a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle several speakers , including the Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Af@@ D Chairman Uwe Young .
in the hall there are about 200 listeners waiting for the nom@@ in@@ ee candidate to speak for the German elections , Alice Wei@@ bel , and the deputy chair@@ person Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
the police presence remains unchanged , but so far the officials had a quiet evening .
the Af@@ D event takes a little more than an hour , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there is announced shortly after 21 o &apos;clock .
the police can move away - no special incidents .
trumpet and tro@@ mb@@ one
a hearing with the Wolf@@ man tro@@ mb@@ one Freder@@ ic B@@ elli will be present in the Has@@ la@@ cher Kloster@@ concerts tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 pm in the monastery church .
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with the Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov he gives a concert under the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Balkan folklore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with roots in brass music . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and win solo positions in European top orchest@@ ras .
so Pet@@ kov solo trump@@ eter is at the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is a solo trump@@ eter of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
both unite the desire not only to cross borders on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres .
Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like in a new ro@@ be , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ der &apos;s world music unites with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the Jazz@@ ech@@ op@@ rei@@ str@@ ä@@ ger N@@ ils W@@ ogram , classical , jazz and free play blend into a fascinating synthesis of arts .
this core of the program was only premi@@ ered this spring with success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram wrote it especially for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ la@@ cher Klo@@ sterk@@ irche with its special acoustics is deliberately included in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about her bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; some people love grilled che@@ eses and will eat it until the end of their lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart on her bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I bite in grilled cheese I think , &apos; Oh that was cool , what &apos;s next ? &apos; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most well @-@ known relationship of Hollywood stars was Robert P@@ att@@ inson &apos;s &quot; T@@ wi@@ light &quot; colleague , who finally dealt bitter@@ ly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite all this , the brunette performer confirms to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s B@@ az@@ aar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was seriously fallen in love with whom I have said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; or do you think I &apos;ve played it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after her separation , Kri@@ sten admitted that she was bis@@ exual : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have always lived du@@ alism and believed it seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has never hin@@ dered me or hin@@ dered me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I just never liked being taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in particular she suffered under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in school time , when she preferred dressed like a boy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this really hurt me very much .
when I was eleven , the children told me I would look like a boy .
I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and think to myself : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; girls , be proud of you ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , they do not like to explain their love life : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people expect you to get in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some describe me as ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself to the whole public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
West Virginia Gover@@ nor announces that he changes the party
the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening with a demonstration with President Tru@@ mp that he will change the party .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of reflection ... Today I will tell you as inhabitants of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I &apos;m a democratic Gover@@ nor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rally broke out in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , &quot; Justice added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a trainer , I would say it is time to play another game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp promised before a big announcement at West Virginia R@@ ally .
Mr. Tru@@ mp won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not endor@@ se the Democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton .
justice , which according to For@@ bes is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes states that he owns coal mines in five states and has inherited a coal business from his father .
it is worth approximately 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
in the meantime , on Thursday evening , the Republi@@ can National Committee issued an explanation in which it said : &quot; the party change of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a Democratic Party that would rather hin@@ der us than to make our country great . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is only the final rejection of a party which is from top to bottom without leadership and is unable to find a positive , convincing message , &quot; said the Chairman of the R@@ NC , Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel , in an explanation of C@@ BS News .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian ap@@ ology for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious ap@@ ology from Russia as a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be included in the sport again .
Russian Ath@@ le@@ tics Chef D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ lac@@ h@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the World Ath@@ le@@ tics Championships that the exile of his country was correct and that he was determined to fight the dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes who were grab@@ bed gold and silver med@@ als at competitions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress agreed on the maintenance of the ban imposed in November 2015 , after a report from the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) had found evidence on state funded dop@@ ing in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open response today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e to re@@ porters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the whole Council and the whole Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized by itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E said he was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delighted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia would accept the criteria for its re @-@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think progress has been made , but Congress does not support the recommendations of the Task Force that it is not the moment to re @-@ use Russia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to do everything in the next few months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean ath@@ lets from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; he added
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete at the Ath@@ le@@ tics Championships which begin on Friday in London according to the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the IA@@ AF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia needs to meet some of the criteria for a re @-@ adjustment .
drug testing is still insufficient and forbidden trainers are still working free , he told re@@ porters in London after giving a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council .
soldiers cut off for Mali in Mali
at a funeral service in the North H@@ essi@@ an F@@ rit@@ z@@ lar some 1000 people of the two soldiers killed in a helicopter crash in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security precau@@ tions .
for an un@@ explained crash , Minister of Defence Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) said nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she described the two revers@@ ed drivers but as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crow@@ ning of their expertise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow down to this highest sacrifice provided by them in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ s@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from Nord@@ h@@ essen had died Wednesday a week ago in Mali .
their coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and accompanied by a dead guard of the German army in the F@@ rit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Cathedral Sankt Peter on Thursday .
at noon , only the members of the church took leave .
after that , the funeral took place in the circle of the family , close friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr as well as of politics .
among them were H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the General In@@ spec@@ tor Volker Vi@@ eker .
the gro@@ aned ro@@ ses laid down ro@@ ses , the relatives stood arm in arm on the coff@@ ins .
before the church , F@@ rit@@ z@@ lar@@ s and numerous soldiers pursued the ceremony on canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Minister of Defence of the Le@@ yen designated the fallen soldiers as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann had built up the flight operation of the fighter @-@ helicopter Tiger in F@@ rit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tig@@ ers of his regi@@ ment .
Volker Bau@@ ers@@ warned , commander of the regi@@ ment , to whom the soldiers are belonging , said : &quot; if this crew could not turn off the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot;
doubts about the UN mission in Mali did not show the Minister of the Le@@ yen : the deployment would be dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is also of great importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country from which we are separated only by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the funeral ceremony the coff@@ ins were brought out of the cathedral .
when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr does not provide any information .
Prince Hen@@ rik doesn &apos;t want grave beside his wife
the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death .
that was what the Royal House informed on Thursday .
traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in the Ros@@ kil@@ de cathedral .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already built a sar@@ cop@@ hag@@ us for the two .
the Queen had agreed with her husband &apos;s decision , she said it further in the message .
where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried , be still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 he would have liked to become king .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2016 , he retired and also submitted the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prince Su@@ pper &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since Hen@@ rik in Denmark did not get the title and the function he wanted , he did not see himself as equivalent to his wife - not after death , L@@ ene Bal@@ le@@ by , the chief speaker of the Danish royal house .
where the last resting @-@ place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be , be still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country he has worked for over the last 50 years .
born in 1965 in London , the born @-@ born Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French aristoc@@ ratic family , met Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1965 .
on the Th@@ ames , he worked in the French embassy .
during his later wife the sympath@@ ies of the people always flew , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stance in his almost 50 @-@ year reign with the Dan@@ es .
in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik commented on the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival everything I did was critici@@ zed .
my Danish was swa@@ ying , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk stock@@ ings instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ l@@ ises , which I smo@@ ked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation of being the brand of society @-@ critical intellec@@ tuals , I could not hope for indul@@ gence .
I was different .
I seemed to be happy with this position and not to be ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these were two mistakes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants a quick re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
after the loss of the red @-@ green ruling majority for a rapid re @-@ election of the parliament , Lower Saxony &apos;s Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) does not want to res@@ ign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , it was speaking for the resolution of the parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot;
prior to that , the surprising withdrawal of a Green party from its Parliament fraction in Lower Saxony has pl@@ ung@@ ed the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .
five months before the official date of the Sunday election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its narrow one @-@ voice majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the former Green Party El@@ ke T@@ westen combined her step with non @-@ nom@@ ination for election 2018 in her constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( W@@ ü@@ m@@ me ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained on Friday in Hanover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; group leader Björn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his group to include them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , CD@@ U and F@@ DP had together 69 seats in the Lower Saxony State Parliament , the SPD and Green 68 seats .
so far the relationship has been revers@@ ed .
the new Land@@ tag will be elected regul@@ ary on the 14th of January next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said that the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether to continue to go@@ vern in this situation without a majority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Stephan Wei@@ l considers it imperative that the Land@@ tag quickly resol@@ ves its self @-@ resolution as soon as possible .
the CD@@ U is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
the state constitution also fores@@ ees the possibility that the Land@@ tag of the Prime Minister depri@@ ves the Prime Minister of confidence and chooses a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution offers several options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these options must be legally clean@@ sed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one will discuss all questions in peace if they are judi@@ ci@@ ously tested . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ west@@ ens Step &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but something &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kur@@ i@@ os . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian herself stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel very good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Gre@@ ens called on the back@@ sliding de@@ pu@@ ties to return their country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume , of course , that she returns to her country parliament that she has received over the green national list , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the pres@@ idents Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; s &amp; D Group president Anja P@@ iel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we deeply regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ westen combined . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I firmly decided not to do any pron@@ unciation in the Group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even against the background that there were no differences in content , we cannot understand this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SPD Chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the transfer of the Lower Saxony Green Party members El@@ ke T@@ westen to CD@@ U as treas@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the attitude of the former Green Party members in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the Federal Chancellor of the Socialists and Democrats on Facebook on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly elect the Land@@ tag .
the exit T@@ west@@ ens costs the majority in Lower Saxony in Lower Saxony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the policy officer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her final vanity and fru@@ stration her personal interests before the welfare of the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critic@@ ised SPD general secretary , Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony is taking this dirty in@@ filtr@@ ate game and trying to beat political capital out of it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dutch CD@@ U fac@@ tional leader Björn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his de@@ pu@@ ties to include El@@ ke T@@ westen to the CD@@ U .
the SPD leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , proposed T@@ westen there to fal@@ si@@ fy the results of the 2013 Land@@ tag election with personal care@@ ers .
the CD@@ U was then in front of the SPD , the strongest force , the SPD and the Green party had a very thin majority of one voice in parliament .
Minister of Agriculture in the Interview - How do we protect ourselves from gyp@@ sies , Herr Schmidt ?
Germany discusses about contaminated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers safeguard themselves ?
Minister of Agriculture , Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) , is in an interview with the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) Spe@@ ech and Ans@@ wer .
Mr Schmidt , How can consumers protect themselves from pois@@ oned eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumers to look at the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp print .
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ gro@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states provide the latest information on the affected eggs @-@ char@@ ms .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if , after all , what we currently know is a health hazard virtually excluded .
does Al@@ di now take over the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs from the offer - because the central role of the clari@@ fier is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless my house has immediately turned up and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since the announcement of the dis@@ satisfaction of Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all information and risk assessments are available for consumers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
retailers are also worried about the fact that the sold @-@ out products are market@@ able and harmless to health .
if the highest maximum content of 0.00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded , these are non @-@ market@@ able .
un@@ poll@@ uted eggs can , however , be sold and consumed .
this time the factories are not to blame .
do production companies and consumers sit in the same boat ?
according to the present state of knowledge , the production companies are not directly responsible .
on the contrary , they have to reck@@ on with economic damages due to the presum@@ ed illegal practices of service companies .
as always , there are too few controllers in the seri@@ ousness of harvest .
is there a lack of personal or coher@@ ent jurisdiction only ?
it was just the official controls that revealed the process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the truth is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100 percent excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is precisely because of this that a consistent education of such events and the transfer to the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in the cases in which criminal off@@ ences may be present are of decisive importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already stated several times that I expect a complete enlightenment by the responsible authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
is regular al@@ er@@ mis@@ m in food sc@@ and@@ als really necessary ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consumers have the right to only receive safe and market@@ able food . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when an un@@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly ou@@ tra@@ ged .
the pan@@ de@@ mic means manufacturers , traders and consumers get into a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
in principle it must be clear that the un@@ lawful use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ supplying animals is not acceptable and must be terminated immediately .
at all levels , it is necessary to work consistently and with high pressure on all levels .
I expect from all the competent authorities that the facts are quickly and comprehen@@ sively elu@@ ci@@ dated .
how the financial rules of football affect N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ imped@@ ed issues of European football clubs will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Barcelona to the Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main of the UEF@@ A , as the guiding organisation that over@@ sees the European game has the power to for@@ bid teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair Play rules , launched in 2011 by the UEF@@ A , mean that PS@@ G will eventually prove that the transfer from N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without major losses .
Barcelona has paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( 26@@ 2 million dollars ) to extract the Brazilian from its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary which will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to France .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PS@@ G can safely do the money to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar and bring it into a galax@@ y of other stars , given the funding of the team by the energy @-@ rich ruling family of Qatar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
publishers are allowed to spend a lot of money on the purchase of players , but must deal with legitimate sources of revenue that allow them to break even point in their soccer @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEF@@ A President in 2007 .
the former French player believed that clubs , who had taken enormous debts in their quest for success , effectively che@@ ated and ris@@ ked to ruin themselves when banks or propriet@@ ors with@@ drew their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentrating on the debts of clubs to monitor their losses .
the change meant that the business model , originally used by Roman Abr@@ amo@@ vich in Chelsea in 2003 , bought a club with potential and then invested strongly to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder matter .
during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P exp@@ ir@@ ation period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses of EUR 30 million .
and although Plat@@ ini has fallen from the pres@@ idency in 2015 , his successor , Alek@@ s@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in , continues to be deter@@ red by excessive expenses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certainly FF@@ P is not dead and we will surely reinforce the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , opposite The Associ@@ ated Press last week . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a package , it can distribute the amount for billing over the duration of its contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract so that the revenues for the next five years can be reported in the amount of 4@@ 4.4 million euros in the annual financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has hit the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , owned by Manchester City , with the tough@@ est sanctions .
the PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( at that time 82 million dollars ) , which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players .
the UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that could try to outs@@ m@@ art their financial view by raising their revenue from companies associated with the owners of clubs .
while a cat@@ arian business could sponsor the PS@@ G if the value of sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market rates , UEF@@ A would not be considered legitimate revenues .
this was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEF@@ A decided that the P@@ SA sponsorship of the Qatar Tourism Authority has been se@@ wn up .
it was reported that part of the PS@@ G Pay@@ ments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come about payments from the Organization Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
but by 2022 , PS@@ G and Qatar have argued that N@@ ey@@ mar won the World Cup and that such maneu@@ ver could be easily detected for the UEF@@ A regulatory authorities .
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that UEF@@ A will be more attentive to respecting each attempt to circum@@ vent the rules .
the UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G about N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s transfer , on Thursday the people familiar with the situation .
they spoke of the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press as they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 generated revenues of € 54@@ 2.4 million with a profit of more than 10 million euros .
the accounts for the last fiscal year still need to be published .
PS@@ G expects N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrival to be a blessing for sponsorship deals , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot purchases .
the association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent following signature .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players going to see , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s departure by claiming that PS@@ G would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , president of the Spanish daily AS regarding Qatar &apos;s last ownership of PS@@ G . &quot; &quot; &quot;
arsen@@ al @-@ Manager Ar@@ sene Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American sport ty@@ co@@ on , shares the reservations of La Liga against a state that finances an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the owners and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football during the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very difficult to respect the financial fair play because one can take different paths or have different interests if a country has such a great actor to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new software supplier
chocolate has produced Fre@@ y Board chocolate for Swiss in recent years .
now the sweet cooperation is in front of a possible end : the airline prescri@@ bes the order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Swiss @-@ speaker Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rot@@ t confirmed a report from the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schweiz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on request by the news agency s@@ da . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very satisfied with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokesperson . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some 17 million small red @-@ white zi@@ pped bil@@ l@@ boards up to 14 grams are distributed every year before landing to the passengers .
Swiss Life does not want to provide any information about the costs .
industry insi@@ ders estimate the volume of order according to &quot; North @-@ West Switzerland &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary generates annual turnover of around 1 billion Swiss francs .
but what is more important is the advertising effect : it is a prestigious order for a chocolate manufacturer .
Swiss will not disclose how many applicants are present in the new tender .
but only Swiss producers come into question .
according to the newspaper article , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y tries to renew the treaty over the spring 2018 .
for the s@@ da , the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not reachable for an opinion .
chocolate bars distribute the Swiss since 2006 on board their flights .
before signing a contract with Mig@@ ros daughter , Bar@@ ry Cal@@ le@@ baut had delivered the chocolate tablet in collaboration with Hu@@ g .
the opportunity to place the logo was introduced two and a half years ago with the start of collaboration with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline operates with different Swiss chocolate producers .
on long haul flights , First Class customers are spoiled with treats by the confection@@ ery Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in the Business Class nas@@ chen passengers Sch@@ og@@ gi von Lin@@ dt and in Economy Class Sch@@ og@@ gi from Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
also on the short circuit , Swiss Sch@@ og@@ gi of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , both in business and Economy Class .
athle@@ tics - Dis@@ cus Olympic Champion Robert Hart@@ ing reaches World Cup Final
the three @-@ time World Champion will fight for a medal on Saturday in the final .
his brother Christoph , Olympic Champion of 2016 , had failed in the national championship qualifying and could only watch the disc@@ us competition from the grand@@ stand .
also with the first attempt was the Polish title defender , Pi@@ ot@@ r Mal@@ ach@@ owski , who threw 6@@ 5.@@ 13 meters far for the final battle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no@@ stal@@ gia goes to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; into the niche &quot; &quot; &quot;
this repetition of history is at the same time no@@ stal@@ gic for the glorious days of characters of the 80 &apos;s , for the 90 @-@ year Gr@@ unge era ( as the pione@@ ers David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter rot@@ ated the Sk@@ etch Com@@ edy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for himself - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , like Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Rud@@ d went to bigger things .
as a cultural art@@ ef@@ act , it is equally a par@@ ody and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era of permanent memories .
but as fran@@ chise it feels like time is scar@@ ce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first Day of Camp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worked surprisingly well , not only because of its absurd hum@@ our ( it contained an original story for a promising can of vegetables that was pronounced by H. Jon ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by dividing up to the nucle@@ us of the g@@ ags - middle @-@ aged actors play cool children who grow up - nevertheless they manage to regain the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es .
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults playing adult now , is less emo@@ tionally rooted and his par@@ ody goes more according to the casting behavior principle , including a riff on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 &apos;s like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at one point a character rum@@ bles through an Apple Power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the lovely C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now a Roman@@ au@@ tor , has still not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) .
Victor ( Ken Serena ) has still not lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there &apos;s another crazy @-@ vi@@ cious P@@ lot , which Ron@@ ald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) is involved , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well @-@ successful impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always , the ex@@ ams are the best part of the fran@@ chise .
it is especially fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Rud@@ d , the Matt D@@ ill@@ ons sub @-@ lip of &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy is now feeling like an old cra@@ cker .
these are moments of random ma@@ dness that could inc@@ ite this fran@@ chise as a kind of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until he reaches what I consider his logical conclusion : &quot; wet Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene will show the band how to visit the film premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
now , &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon commemor@@ ates another kind of no@@ stal@@ gia : to revi@@ ve the Cold War by &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even to &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; with its east @-@ west w@@ rest@@ ling icon@@ ography .
the com@@ edy , created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka , announces to be a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est fighting for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the path of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism .
the main roles - a hard @-@ boiled Gregor and an ide@@ alistic ic@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i , whose di@@ alogues are synchron@@ ized by Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( likewise an extensive producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt in English .
it is a brilliant idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice g@@ ags to watch ( the police sp@@ ends time watching chess on TV , as Americans might do with football ) .
and the list of famous speakers - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent game &apos; Fin@@ de the voice out &apos; .
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is so committed to the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer wearing a Re@@ agan mask is involved - that it often plays like a single one .
in six long episodes , it pul@@ ls away , and the com@@ edy is not fast or frequent enough .
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective , &quot; who was re@@ directed to a smaller length , could better deliver his Ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re , because Greg@@ ory and I@@ os@@ eph continue to visit the American embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thi@@ cker men who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers .
the message for the imag@@ inary communist audience is that Western culture can make everything a food for money .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even make it with our own younger history and with thei@@ rs .
coup against drug ma@@ fia in the country
the police succeeded in beating the Italian Maf@@ ia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning in the Schwar@@ zwald @-@ Ba@@ ar @-@ Kreis , in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart numerous objects were searched , as the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office told Kon@@ stanz on Friday .
fifteen accused were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and already issued arrest warran@@ ts against them .
moreover , officials placed large quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms as well as several hundred thousand Euros .
two persons were arrested during the same ra@@ ids in Italy .
against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans there were German arrest warran@@ ts .
the two are therefore probably delivered to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in the action .
altogether over 300 police officers were in operation .
the ma@@ fia &apos;s members are accused of organized drug crimin@@ ality , violent acts of violence , attempted murder , rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail .
since summer 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office in Kon@@ stanz has been investigating the organised drug trade in Southern Germany .
between the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Constance and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
therefore , the major use on Wednesday morning was accompanied by four official officials from Palermo .
the investigation focused mainly on Italian nation@@ als with a close relationship with the Italian ma@@ fia .
a incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the bank account .
wise L@@ oo@@ king large gaps in the foreig@@ ner &apos;s register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens who should not appear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the foreigners register in Germany shows substantial short@@ com@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this leads to some serious mis@@ decisions on asylum procedures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a media report , the commission@@ er for the refugee management of the German government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , drew attention to large gaps in the country &apos;s central register .
defici@@ encies in the data recorded there may lead to some serious mis@@ decisions in the case of asylum procedures and deport@@ ations , warned in an analysis , which is present in the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung ) .
according to figures , ten million people with foreign nationality are registered in the register , including about 5.@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data is therefore administered by about 600 ali@@ ens polic@@ ing authorities in Germany .
because the data were not maintained adequately , the data quality in parts has not been good so far .
in individual cases , data from 1921 were found , &quot; of people who are no longer alive , or citizens that have become German citizens and should actually no longer appear in the register . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incorrect data entries can slow down revers@@ al processes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the statistics of a sufficient number of people there are also EU citizens who do not have to travel at all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such false attri@@ butions , however , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; led to a distorted debate on the handling of sufficient &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; therefore means in the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the Federal Government has apparently started sending refugee families back to Italy with 16 @-@ year @-@ old children when they arrived from there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this emerges from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neue O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rück Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the paper it means that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BA@@ MF lead such methods &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and to@@ dd@@ lers - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the end of 2014 , this was practically no longer possible , so the newspaper referred to the difficult situation on the spot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin Agreement , refugees from the EU state are responsible for reaching them first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a migrant continues to travel to another EU country , this state can send it back to the en@@ rol@@ ment country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the office now writes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the recording capacity for families with under@@ age children in Italy has considerably increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy provided guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) considers these commitments sufficient .
other EU states would also send refugees back there within the Dublin Agreement .
the internal political spokes@@ woman of the left @-@ wing fraction in the German Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children are threatening for the lack of un@@ lawful reception conditions and a threat to child welfare due to the lack of un@@ lawful reception conditions in the Italian asylum system . &quot;
second @-@ best result achieved
a total of 220 liters of blood of people living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach has already provided the blood donation service to other people .
at least of the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday .
above all Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who has now divided 50 litres of blood with his 100 donations .
traditionally , in the meeting of the Municipal Council , the congregation acknow@@ le@@ dges the multiple readiness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is brilliant how our body is laid out for it and we pay respect for the don@@ ors who make their blood available to strangers , even more un@@ sel@@ fish , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under@@ lined mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a single blood donation helps several people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Holger Ma@@ isen@@ bacher , Director of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , because the preserved foods are de@@ composed into their constitu@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , three people could benefit from a blood donation .
at the same time , Ma@@ isen@@ bacher reported of the actions carried out in the spring of Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach .
&quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ators , &quot; said the DR@@ K Regional Manager .
obviously , the change to the theatre house has led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago .
before that Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Sh@@ ort@@ cake en@@ um@@ er@@ ated to the multiple don@@ ors and were awarded for 50 donated blood donations each .

the Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged , after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened spec@@ ulation over an increase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England has warned that economic growth will &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slow &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it retained the interest rates on family income in the middle of an increased pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the political decision @-@ makers in the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) agreed with 6 to 2 to keep interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with fewer members in this month to rise since weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase .
in its quar@@ terly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and in 2018 to 1.6 % and warned that the pressure on budget@@ ary income would continue , with inflation expected to rise to almost 3 % in the fall .
but they sign@@ alized that interest increases would be necessary over the next few years to cur@@ b inflation , and she said that credit costs might have to rise more than expected on the financial markets .
the members also voted to withdraw part of the mamm@@ oth economic package issued a year after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
it will require time for the finance plan to provide cheaper financing for banks as of the next February , although it has been said that it is now expected that it will provide $ 15 billion more within the framework of this system - with a £ 115 billion pound .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after deciding on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the central forec@@ asting of the M@@ PC the Gross Dom@@ estic Product ( GDP ) remains weak at short notice , since the pressure on the real income of households continued to strain consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the rate of interest they repeated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be necessary for the cooling of inflation and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; somewhat greater &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scale than the markets would expect . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the markets are forec@@ asting the first rise in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the bank stressed that increases would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limited &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
adjusted down@@ wards , the Bank &apos;s growth forecasts for this and next year are 1.9 % and 1.7 % forecast in May .
it has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell after these messages against the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision on no change comes after the recent dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures have damp@@ ened the rising expectations of interest rate increase and GDP in the second quarter rose from 0.2 % to 0.3 % in the previous three months .
growth will likely be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will recover slightly after the Bank at the end of the year .
the most recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households that are affected by rising inflation and marginal sal@@ aries , since tigh@@ tening is getting worse first before it gets better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that monetary policy cannot &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the income tax in the coming years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but she added that wages will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of her three @-@ year forecast . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is also strengthened by the increasing demand for British goods , which is attributable to the weak pound , which will compensate for a part of lower consumption expenditure .
the decision comes a year after the lowering of interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % in the last August following the shock@@ ing EU vote that caused the sin@@ king of the pound .
the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years to fully achieve the prices and the economy .
prior to the last judgment of the Bank on interest rates , the call for interest rates rose , as inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three political decision makers demanding an increase of 0.5 % in July .
inflation has dropped from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the bank said that this has been expected and will attract them again in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the bank said that the excess in relation to its goal of 2 % was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wholly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the weak pound . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director at Cor@@ eco Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the recent swa@@ p of swa@@ p rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to become more competitive , as the credi@@ tors are lou@@ dly looking for business and want to end the year in a positive way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the market looks especially good for those in whom the existing deals run out and the new mort@@ g@@ ages complete , and many with toll @-@ free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) Sh@@ ould write disputed HIV drug 10,000 people
patients will receive access to a &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV prevention treatment from September after a high court fight against the financing of the drug in the N@@ HS .
N@@ HS England announced that pre @-@ exposure pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) recorded prior to intercourse , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now being delivered by the health service via a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he agreed to finance the trial , after the Appe@@ als Court confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court last year after which the Court of Appe@@ al had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the alleg@@ ation that local authorities should finance him .
the chess train announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS UK boss Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as an &quot; important new intervention , &quot; while the National Aids Trust ( NA@@ T ) called this as the &quot; decisive moment . &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be among the first to make the registration of people possible , and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced to the whole of England in April 2018 .
pre@@ p prevention pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV @-@ preparations which are taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces the HIV transmission in infection risk .
pre@@ p prior to intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection .
such medication can be taken every day or just two hours before sexual intercourse .
those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexual and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated .
in clinics , suitable candidates will be identified , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV @-@ status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment .
people living in England and registered with a family doctor can also register for possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program will be £ 10 million and N@@ HS UK signed a contract to supply medicines this week after an international competitive procurement .
the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting clinical evidence as it is widely used , recorded and implemented on a large scale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in cop@@ ing with one of mankind &apos;s greatest health challenges . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National Aids Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .
pre@@ p , if targeted at vulnerable and vulnerable people , provides the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic .
from September onwards , people with high HIV risk gain access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded try in England to develop a new instrument that is truly controlled individually and is not subject to a negotiation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Green , Chief Executive Officer of the Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the priority must now be that the study is carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; now that the pre@@ p test medicine has been proc@@ ured , we are on the best way to protect over 10,000 people infected with HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Shar@@ on H@@ od@@ g@@ son , Minister of Health , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the start of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delay and delay in implementation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt takes us a step closer to understanding the advantages of pre@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country in order to protect people who are infected with HIV and that it will contribute to the completion of the spread of HIV in society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
living the big life : mezzanine and clever design tricks have turned this small Ear@@ ls Court home into a spacious home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , reduced himself from a big house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to Ear@@ ls Court apartment in 2014 .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed and sold her bags .
&quot; before that I lived in a much larger room with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge , &quot; says Jo@@ anne .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I looked for something comparable to my price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court and she had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in love with her and made an offer this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot has been completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ room property with a ne@@ sted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - wanted to add Jo@@ anne storage space and an mezzanine to make use of the spacious ceiling height optimally .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .
that was my request , &quot; she says .
for this purpose , she instructed the architecture and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed of Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use the 12.@@ 5 foot high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms over each other , so that the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate level in which one could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to solve the task .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the steel works are quite complicated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were st@@ acked on top of each other without having to bend us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it wasn &apos;t just about building a simple platform , but to create the steel so that it had the right height for the function at the top or bottom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms at full height above each other - with a lot of additional drama .
for the mezzanine , a classic copper glazing window from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area .
mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .
at both ends , a short corridor is mirr@@ ored to make it work longer .
in the kitchen , the mirror feels like a window into another room .
at the entrance , mirr@@ ored units offer space for all the seating and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .
collap@@ sible kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bit of engineering art went inside , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Er@@ fan from the steel @-@ reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important , so when you push the door forward , it gli@@ des very easily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne was able to gain an additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the day , you will sell the land - or how your property is appreciated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form a real estate agent will enter and a calculation based on the size of the floor will be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here they have managed to enlarge the floor area and at the same time use high @-@ quality materials giving the room its luxurious benefit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things that you touch and help create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do not love the electrical sockets in the walls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that a flat can be transformed by a good design and increased square footage of some standard into something completely amazing .
in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide to not leave it .
brothers fight for a $ 500 million real estate empire
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty in a debate because of one of Vict@@ ori@@ as &apos;s biggest real estate agents worth over $ 500 million .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul .
Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp debate on separation takes place in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers have accumulated 38 real estate worth more than half a billion dollars , since the family purchased a business in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood since 1973 .
the West@@ co jeans company founded jeans there and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999 .
this money has been invested in real estate , and De Lu@@ tis &apos;s portfolio now includes offices in the city center , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt . Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centres in the suburbs .
following an agreement with her dec@@ eased father , Col@@ in - by Paul as &quot; the main operator and the dominant personality &quot; is described in the De Lu@@ tis family - about two @-@ thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third .
a court record states that this means that Col@@ in owns property worth $ 3@@ 16 million and Paul valued at a value of 176 million dollars .
the division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the divisions proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I thought for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in 2015 in a first aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday , after several failed negotiations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice took place .
the brothers now also struggle for control of the existing business - of which Col@@ in , like Paul asser@@ ts , has excluded him .
Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but suggests Paul to in@@ compet@@ ently manage some possessions .
in an early Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it that was filed by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Italian inheritance dict@@ ates that the family is the most important priority , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs rise in the event , with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , emails and reports from companies including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck C@@ ram@@ er , and with leading lawyers , among them Allan My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and from both parties held law firms .
Ms. De Lu@@ tis and her dec@@ eased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delic@@ at@@ essen stores from the late 1950s and bought a business in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early 1970s .
they used the security to buy the coll@@ ing@@ wood property in which Col@@ in opened the family &apos;s first jeans shop .
Col@@ in says that he began West@@ co there when he was &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass on their property to their sons ben@@ evol@@ ently .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis group of companies , with Col@@ in claimed that Mark had paid $ 10 million while leaving the company and Luke 26 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has become bitter about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in held back very well , although he was a former AF@@ L member of the AF@@ L and after a biography of the year 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire the best friend of television stars .
Fair@@ fax Media contacted Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Col@@ in answered by SMS to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can really not say much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the case is before the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very sad that my brother Paul has decided to acc@@ use me and draw our sur@@ name through the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and me to end up in our current conflict , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said and added that he &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still hope for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday , this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our business will be solved in the near future by the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Col@@ in wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tru@@ mp@@ s new Chief of Staff plans to limit the president &apos;s media abst@@ in@@ ence .
others have tried and failed .
perhaps John F. Kel@@ ly can actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
Poli@@ tico reports that the White House &apos;s new Chief of Staff plans to limit the flow of information to President Tru@@ mp - including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more consistent track .
here is a piece of re@@ porter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kel@@ ly , the White House &apos;s new Chief of Staff , met with leading employees on his first day of work , he posed a major problem in President Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s White House , which he wanted to repair : bad information that was thrown into the president &apos;s hands .
Kel@@ ly told the staff that information should flow through him - whether on paper or in mail@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot;
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame trucks by monitoring his media diet .
President Tru@@ mp@@ s relationship to television ranges back decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if candidate Tru@@ mp was angry for unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting of jobs that were to convince , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said former campaign advis@@ er Sam N@@ un@@ berg against Poli@@ tico in February . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote in the time that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the key to keep Tru@@ mp@@ s Twitter custom under control , according to six former electoral campaigns , is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
al@@ right .
but the idea that Tru@@ mp@@ s Twitter custom ever was &quot; under control &quot; is ridi@@ culous .
maybe these campaign officials know something we don &apos;t know , that Tru@@ mp@@ s twe@@ ets wouldn &apos;t have contained even more combus@@ tible materials without their interventions .
we will probably never know anything about twe@@ ets that Tru@@ mp didn &apos;t broadcast .
if his co @-@ workers manage to keep him away from him a few times , then their efforts paid off .
but no one has consistently for@@ est@@ alled that Tru@@ mp causes controversy .
part of the problem is that people in a White House , composed of competing parties , always try to put forward their own agenda by presenting Tru@@ mp material that may promote their views of the world .
Poli@@ tico - focused entirely on this story - reported in May on the pre@@ dil@@ ection of the advis@@ ers to provide doubt@@ ful information to the president for strategic reasons .
this was an example described by Re@@ porter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ smith :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former Tru@@ mp officials say that Tru@@ mp can respond to negative press cuts , especially those with damaging le@@ aks , and that he is able to figure out where they come from . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone was malicious in writing a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet pro@@ voc@@ ateur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; being the source behind a pile of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House .
although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for ch@@ ic@@ anes or that he offered no concrete evidence , or that he has expressed false alleg@@ ations in the past and has rev@@ oked it .
Tru@@ mp read the article and started asking staff about Wal@@ sh . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; gold @-@ makers added that the former Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and General Secretary of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tried to implement a system in order to manage and document the paper@@ work that Tru@@ mp receives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how did it work ?
Kel@@ ly tries to do the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove himself as an effective manager as Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tru@@ mp still is his impul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors are still striving for influence .
these imm@@ utable factors make Kell@@ ys Mission very difficult .
most sought @-@ after criminals receive mail from Euro@@ pol
since the address is unknown , the help of the population will be asked and hoped .
the police all over Europe send this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards to dangerous criminals .
as the addresses of the most sought @-@ after criminals are not known in nature , po@@ inters from the population are hoped and asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Euro@@ pol reported on Friday the action following the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU Most W@@ an@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; advent calendar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the experiences would have shown that many fle@@ ets hide at vacation destinations , it was called Euro@@ pol .
you have put together 21 post@@ cards for sought @-@ after criminals from 21 EU countries .
for more than 2.5 million times it has been visited on this website .
36 of the online votes could have been arrested so far , at least eleven of them due to indications of publication on the website .
travelers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; million@@ aire line &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est land@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands are once again with a few determined traveler on the batt@@ lefield , who have negotiated a dit@@ ch drawn from the commune to claim a field in front of their man@@ sions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; travelers have par@@ ked their 20 caravan on a field outside a well @-@ to @-@ do Soli@@ hull street called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; million@@ aire row &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they brought horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters , after they were thrown out only in May without being deter@@ red by a dit@@ ch dug by the Council to prevent their sei@@ zur@@ es .
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in defence facilities and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; ra@@ ging residents have pushed the Council of Soli@@ hull , who said it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; an anonymous inhabit@@ ant said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they went there on Monday evening after they were forwarded by Bentley He@@ ath where they threw stones on the pass@@ ers @-@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council has to be forced by shame to implement it , since it was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the travellers were there in May , were moved on and are now back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; more came last night , probably even more today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she added : &quot; the Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by holding a long brief@@ ing to protect its parks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I live on Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my local charge if the Council cannot stop it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a resident who didn &apos;t want to be called , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is ridi@@ culous , we have just seen the last round of these travelers to be pl@@ under@@ ed by another round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the numbers have increased this time and you even saw a horse in the park area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of the Soli@@ hull council said : &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised stock on the land beyond the streams brook road and work with the police of Soli@@ hull . we take the necessary legal steps to keep them moving as quickly as possible .
in order to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible announce an anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour in the police by calling 101 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must consider when we set our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Birken@@ hof the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Birken@@ hof you will find the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the house in front of the gates of Freuden@@ stadt is currently being renovated and will be re@@ opened next year .
these are good news for the city .
with the closing of the Birken@@ hof hotel through the former Ambiente Betriebs@@ gesellschaft mbH on 13 April 2014 , some 30,000 overnight stays per year were lost and income from the city tax was also lost .
in the fall of 2014 , in view of the dramatic rising numbers of refugees coming to the district , the hotel building was offered as a collective accommodation , which provided controversial discussions .
the city prevented the housing of asylum seek@@ ers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disputed at that time in the Council .
but above all , Freuden@@ stadt &apos;s mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel location and at that time spoke of serious interested parties in the house .
he should keep right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ otel with Managing Director Birgit Sch@@ erer , based in Bad Berg@@ zab@@ ern , has acquired the former Hotel Birken@@ hof at a voluntary increase in Berlin and wants to make it a home of the three @-@ star Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freuden@@ stadt object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ zab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
you will find Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the former Hotel Birken@@ hof already building sh@@ utt@@ i have been in front of the entrance for some time , and when you enter the house , it becomes clear how extensive renov@@ ations are made .
the floors were pulled out , ceilings partly broken down , old bath@@ tu@@ bs removed from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
there is still much to do by March .
&quot; it &apos;s actually a nice place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style .
the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are installed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything should be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later on , as Thomas Sch@@ erer says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make a piece of jewelry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room belong to the facilities .
one does not want to position themselves at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on a high @-@ level downtown level , Sch@@ erer emphasizes .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise , with its 60 rooms , wants to set up wide , explains Sch@@ erer further .
individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business@@ men should feel at ease in the hotel .
talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Tourism Director Michael Kr@@ ause he has already led , so sha@@ vers .
the performances of the city were identical with those of the hotel group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are on the same line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the investment is high , Thomas Sch@@ erer doesn &apos;t want to specify exactly .
just under one million euros , he calcul@@ ates .
the exterior installations are also brought to the fore , this is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard , there is a large terrace which will be accessible from the restaurant , which is open to the public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimistic : &quot; Freuden@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia affair : us Special Dis@@ counter@@ s Grand Jury
in the Russia affair around US President Donald Tru@@ mp , special investig@@ ator Robert Mu@@ eller is said to have deployed a so @-@ called Grand Jury upon a report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the panel recorded the work in the past few weeks , wrote the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on appeal to people entrusted with the matter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the paper took the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller has expanded and intensified his investigations .
the channel CN@@ N reported that there are already first sum@@ mons to the body in connection with a meeting between Tru@@ mp@@ s el@@ dest son and a Russian lawyer .
us intelligence services acc@@ use the Krem@@ lin for a long time interfer@@ ing in the 2016 presidential campaign .
Mu@@ eller investigated whether there were agreements between Tru@@ mp@@ s election campaign team and Moscow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the investigation will focus on several men who acted in the election campaign as advisor to the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to reports , Mu@@ eller took a close look at more and more Tru@@ mp &apos;s private and business environment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a few weeks ago , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; investig@@ ator has personally moved into the centre and for@@ ear@@ ns whether the president may have hin@@ dered the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main task of Grand Jur@@ ys is to examine present evidence in possible criminal cases and decide whether to be charged .
the Grand Jur@@ ys are therefore also called Ank@@ le Clips .
most of the time , they are switched on when dealing with larger and controversial cases .
the procedure is always done behind closed doors .
the panel can also be switched on by the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office in order to invite persons to the hearing under E@@ id .
according to CN@@ N , inv@@ itations have already been issued which revol@@ ve around the encounter between Donald Tru@@ mp J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
people who participated in the meeting were invited to a statement , called it in the report .
they should also provide documents .
apart from Tru@@ mp J@@ r. Tru@@ mp@@ s and J@@ ared K@@ us@@ h@@ ner &apos;s son @-@ in @-@ law were also involved in the conversation with Paul Man@@ a@@ fort .
legal experts said on Thursday evening in US television that the setting show that Mu@@ eller would not intim@@ id@@ ate himself in his work and that if necessary , he wanted to act quickly .
but it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be switched on at the end to decide on the charge of an indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the sub@@ stitution of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause for concern for President Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the midst of the new revelations , the President made a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portra@@ y the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Russian history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the subject gives the democr@@ ats a way to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; feel good &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because they have nothing else to talk about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special advisor T@@ y Cob@@ b stated in a statement that he did not know anything about the setting up of a Grand Jury .
but this I usually work in secret , he emphas@@ ised .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the White House advoc@@ ates any action which accelerated the work of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former FB@@ I boss James Com@@ ey said three times that I won &apos;t be as@@ cer@@ tained against the president .
I have no reason to assume that something has changed in that , it was called on in the explanation .
but Mu@@ eller had only been used after Tru@@ mp Com@@ ey had fired .
because of this alleg@@ ation , accus@@ ations against Tru@@ mp had become lou@@ dly , he wanted to hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary .
Com@@ ey said in June before a Senate committee , Tru@@ mp asked him for setting up the investigation against former national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n .
the president is under great pressure because of the investigation .
after the presentation of US media , the White House gathered material against the special investig@@ ator and his staff .
this released spec@@ ulation about whether Tru@@ mp Mu@@ eller was released .
unlike an independent investig@@ ator of the Congress , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair around the later retired President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he theore@@ tically could be fired at the pres@@ idency of the Ministry of Justice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a move . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two groups of Republi@@ can and Democratic sen@@ ators presented draft laws on Thursday that the special investig@@ ator could no longer be dismissed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Antar@@ c@@ tica : gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg drives in Antar@@ c@@ tica
in the western Antar@@ c@@ tica a gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg has been solved by the almost seven @-@ fold size of Berlin from the Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ ra .
this was confirmed by the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred We@@ gener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the col@@ os@@ sus heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometers of large col@@ os@@ sus now dri@@ fts to the north and will probably take two or three years until it is mel@@ ted .
with 175 kilometers of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers , it is one of the largest ice gi@@ ants that researchers have registered in the past three decades .
there is no danger to people from him .
according to researchers , the extent to which climate change has played a role in the decline of the ic@@ e@@ berg is unclear .
in total , however , for some 30 years there has been a series of unusual break@@ through@@ s of ice @-@ tu@@ fts in the region , writes the US Research Center for Snow and Ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a fac@@ tual background .
according to many researchers , this could be related to global warming .
the now broken Kol@@ oss was a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ hag@@ us so far .
Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ ra flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by big glaci@@ ers .
it therefore grows further into the sea and breaks regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ hag@@ us lies south of South America almost at the head of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
North of this ice shelf the balance of wa@@ xes and break@@ ages was disturbed several years ago .
a complete hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e is broken there , writes A@@ WI researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
there &apos;s a lot to say that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ hag@@ us is in danger , as the front edge has never withdrawn as far as it is currently .
in addition , the ice sheet stands under tension and can be dis@@ car@@ ded if a piece is collap@@ sed at a key point .
the melting of Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ ra and Eis@@ berg does not increase sea level because they float on the water and ice as much water as it results in the melting itself .
however , the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glaci@@ ers can flow directly into the sea and much faster than before .
this could possibly increase sea level , but only to a lesser degree , writes the British research project for the observation of Antar@@ c@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) .
according to A@@ WI , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ ra is the fourth largest hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e of Antar@@ c@@ tica with nearly 50 000 square kilometres .
at the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean approximately 200 meters .
there it breaks regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural occurrence and we have no direct connection to climate change , the ice shield now comes into a more dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y of the British S@@ wan@@ sea University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the records , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among scientists is controversial whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ hag@@ us would now grow back or go back in the long term and possibly colli@@ de , said his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
even if these explor@@ ers do not decline this gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg to climate change , many ice caves in the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have fallen apart during the past decades .
this long tip of the Antar@@ c@@ tica extends towards South America .
according to data from the British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s .
the increase in temperature has contributed to the decline .
the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has war@@ med around three degrees over the last 50 years and is therefore one of the areas where the temperature is fastest .
CD@@ U wants to get home tari@@ ff at the staff
because it becomes more and more difficult to occupy vac@@ ant places , the CD@@ U demands to step out of the employer association to become more attractive .
it was only shortly before the summer break that the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous Group in@@ ked 41 new jobs in the administration .
more than 1100 employees and officials are working for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now , 17 trainees have had their first working day .
the teaching positions in the circle are obviously very sought after .
around 6@@ 20 applications were recorded for the places to be awarded this year .
however , the circle is still lacking to handle the increased demands and tasks .
at the moment there are still 50 un@@ occupied places in the M@@ ett@@ mann District .
among other things , we are looking for doctors and engineers as well as general administration personnel .
the CD@@ U , together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG , wants to take the initiative jointly with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
according to the wishes of the parties , the administration aims to develop a concept for recru@@ iting personnel and personnel development . &quot;
the aim is to not only cover short @-@ term needs for skilled workers , but to counter@@ act the future @-@ oriented application shortage , that is to say .
the overall concept should be oriented inside and outside , show concrete measures for beginners and include an education offensive , demand CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
this sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you didn &apos;t know before .
other towns advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is of a real &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of the public employers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is a high number of employees who leave the service due to illness or age .
it is time for action so that no more jobs will remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter &apos;s people , leader of the CD@@ U , go beyond the joint request with his party .
he already caused a big surprise in the spinning day , when he openly questioned the cost coverage and ba@@ ff@@ led the rest of the parties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people want all possibilities to be reviewed which allow a withdrawal from the local employers &quot; association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do not come to a satisfactory solution at short notice , the district administration should strive for a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the county @-@ related cities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , the CD@@ U tries to pay better the employees and officials as it actually envis@@ ages the tari@@ ff for the public service .
the sal@@ aries are currently prescribed exactly , increases or more money are only available when you switch to a higher tier oriented to professional years .
but the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years .
only a few weeks ago new premises had to be established in which employees concerned about the provisions of the new Pro@@ stitution Act .
last but not least , by the increasing number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy sharp@@ ens the tone to NGO migrants rescue boats
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned NGOs that use lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they are not allowed to continue this unless they comply with new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue , &quot; said interior minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a .
Min@@ ni@@ tis alert came a day after the Italian authorities had seized a boat from the German relief organisation &apos; Jugend retention &apos; because their crew worked effectively with human traffi@@ ckers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for a year , refused to comment on the alleg@@ ations of the Italian prosec@@ utor , Am@@ bro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ sio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organization in a statement on social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only judge all accus@@ ations that are currently charged , after collecting all information and assessing the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had supervised the boat from &apos; Jugend retention &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October .
it is thought that his crew takes ding@@ hy migrants on board , delivered directly by human traffi@@ ckers and that smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can shut down so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such meeting was re@@ port@@ edly staged only 1.3 miles in front of the Libyan coast , according to the prosec@@ utor &apos;s acts , whose content was published by Italian media .
the occupation is suspected of taking over the authority of the Italian coast@@ guard who over@@ sees rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives .
under the Code of Con@@ duct , boats such as I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must , above all , have an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs who are involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to abide by the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable , as they would not bring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; major changes or disabilities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to their rescue operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate organization Doc@@ tors With@@ out Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , Minn@@ iti said that the number of migrants who arrived after the rescue measures in Italy had declined sharply in recent weeks , which resulted in the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast@@ guard and the cooperation with local may@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days , we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month via economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries hoping to reach Europe .
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
&quot; &quot; &quot; nine Wei@@ ler@@ mer Bi@@ kers , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Berlin Out@@ post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ enheim in the North @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate to enjoy Trieste and Pl@@ aces for four days . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three friendly guides were available for this .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the castle and wine festival of Wach@@ enheim was a welcome addition .
the first tour led to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim during hot summer temperatures along the vineyards .
there were view@@ points , partly on towers , from which one could see far above the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald and the up@@ stream plains .
in between there were always longer asc@@ ents , for the long tri@@ als rewarded .
on the second day went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to Sal@@ ine and to the folk festival Wur@@ st@@ markt .
again there was a look@@ out point at the look@@ out spot , connected by &quot; flo@@ ated &quot; Tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents .
on the last two days many meters of altitude have been announced .
caves , rocks , towers , fort@@ resses , ruins and in@@ version huts brought welcome breaks .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ kers breathe in the free @-@ air inhal@@ atorium sal@@ ine br@@ ine .
Neustadt was controlled .
after 17@@ 3 kilometers and almost 4@@ 500 metres altitude , the group had become acquainted with the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald from its best side - both sporty and cultural .
console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ liga tires for e @-@ sport
will the sports stars sit in front of computer consoles in the future instead of being sk@@ inn@@ y in wind and weather over the stadium racing ?
fact is : e @-@ sport has long become a serious business , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gau@@ ges included .
the first Afgh@@ ans have also recognized this , which are increasingly involved in this area .
the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later on the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last of the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sport department in mid @-@ July and took up two pro@@ s for the FIFA 17 computer game .
&quot; we hope to inspire whole new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says CEO Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is certain that there are still some clubs on this train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
next weekend , the FIFA World Cup in London organizes the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; where gam@@ ers of different clubs compete against each other .
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven qualify .
also Robin D@@ utt sees great potential in e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ coach of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen currently advises an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; real football must be dealt with particularly with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds that young people still go to the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old .
and : the clubs tried to conquer all sorts of markets , especially the Asian ones .
with prominent e @-@ sports@@ men under contract , one could be present online much more frequently in these markets than once a year to send the German government to Asia .
what is it all about ?
in the E @-@ sport computer games like &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or the football @-@ simulation FIFA are cont@@ ested at competition level .
as in normal sport , they have long established le@@ agues in which the professionals race against each other .
and in Asia &apos;s 2022 e @-@ sport is already part of the official programme .
but is it a real sport in general ?
for many , the idea is certainly getting used to .
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ ail has also been dealing with the question for a long time .
for the professor at the German Sport University in Cologne , e @-@ sport is a sport because he is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that can be found in classical sport - for example , increased heart rates , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes .
in addition , it needs cognitive skills , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and rapid response .
professional gam@@ ers should train their bodies not only at the console but also on their bodies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fit player is a good player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it also sees problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing becomes more and more a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls were difficult to carry on when playing online , and in the scene the structures of classic sport lack@@ ed .
the scientists clearly highlight the high integr@@ ative effect of e @-@ sport .
the players are on the international road , that &apos;s like a big global family , there are no cross @-@ cultural barriers .
a study conducted by the Del@@ o@@ itte business consultancy and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts rapid growth in e @-@ sport .
in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly via advertising , sponsor@@ ing and big tournaments .
sales are expected to reach 130 million in three years .
this is little against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the Bundes@@ liga .
however , &quot; e @-@ sport &quot; is no longer far from other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; writes the Del@@ o@@ itte advis@@ ers .
internationally , many countries are already on the move .
major markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ basketball player Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez participate in the US team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sports competition supplier Uni@@ kr@@ n .
also in Europe a lot is happening .
in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport was introduced as a lesson , says F@@ rob@@ atically .
in the Netherlands and France , the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Ver@@ eine , according to D@@ utt , is now obliged to set up an e @-@ sport department .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European comparison , Germany lag@@ s behind , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says V@@ f@@ B @-@ CEO R@@ ött@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only in no@@ stal@@ gia to fall , and to clarify the old times is no longer sufficient .
the aim is to preserve the tradition of the association , but at the same time align the company to the modern market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we live in a digit@@ alized world , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says D@@ utt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there you can &apos;t stick to it that everything remains as it always was in football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter convic@@ ted for the lyrics that push Con@@ rad Roy to suicide
a woman from Massachusetts has been sentenced to two and a half years because she has encouraged her boy@@ friend to commit suicide through texts and calls .
Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years have been suspended on prob@@ ation .
Car@@ ter was sentenced in June for negli@@ gent murder of Con@@ rad Roy , who took his life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is not comfor@@ ting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Car@@ ter was allowed to remain free until his appointment .
she had been confronted with a maximum of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness .
dressed in red trousers and a cream coloured bl@@ ouse , Car@@ ter was standing with tears in her eyes , folded hands and downward pointing eyes when she was convic@@ ted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her actions have killed Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she finished his life to make her own better . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she has not taken any responsibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has not shown any re@@ mor@@ se . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ter &apos;s lawyer said it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful circum@@ stance that they regret absolutely . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , Jud@@ ge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said he did not find that their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; age or ri@@ pen@@ ess or even their mental illness have a significant influence on their actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a public prosec@@ utor was reading a statement by Roy &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said &quot; there is &quot; no day when I don &apos;t smo@@ ther the loss of my beloved son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything . I try to be there for his sisters in spite of all my pain that we will carry with us for eternity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; persecuted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the realization that she would never take part in her brother &apos;s wedding or be a a@@ unt for his children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no more the only person I have been with since my birth is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case appears to be a legal preced@@ ent , as there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime to challenge another , commit suicide .
Car@@ ter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a vehicle in 2014 .
the case drew national attention after Car@@ ters revealed text messages that she encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; hang up , hop from a building , arise yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the moments before his suicide , she wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to do it , Con@@ rad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All you have to do is turn on the generator and you &apos;ll be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Car@@ ter &apos;s attention was sought by the death of Roy and ruled that she should benefit by any press from the case .
the case has divided the legal opinion .
among the few who defended Car@@ ter was Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was convic@@ ted of murder at her British mate in Italy in 2007 before being acqu@@ itted two years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter ear@@ ns compassion and help , not prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ me : learning from the new Mini @-@ Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
that Joshua Kim@@ me was allowed to run as captain at the Audi Cup is no accident .
the FC Bayern tr@@ kes a great season to the Con@@ fed Cup winner - extra motivation does not harm .
something was different from his place in the cabin , that was when Joshua Kim@@ me immediately saw me , even if the extra garment was very , very small .
but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , of course no Philipp Lah@@ m and no Manuel Neu@@ er could be seen , he made the rush to the arm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trainer did not announce it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Con@@ fed Cup winner after his first deployment as a Bayern captain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
well , the stand could have run better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Nap@@ oli .
but the character of the coach could interpret Kim@@ me as well .
not the eight @-@ year old Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal had been chosen as a game leader in the C @-@ El@@ f , which was born from youth players , de@@ but@@ s and just out of vacation , but he .
sugar is prefer@@ able to those who have a lot of trust , which you want to keep in good mood .
those who were chosen to encounter the heritage of Lah@@ m can only use a little extra motivation .
Kim@@ e confirmed : &quot; this is what you want as a player : assume responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old ti@@ ck@@ led as a mini @-@ Lah@@ m over the field .
to the right rear , this is his position , the white band@@ age at the arm did her rest .
and at all Kim@@ e worked in this start @-@ up as the one who can take the helm one &apos;s hand also best .
he gave instructions , tried to direct the un@@ rehear@@ sed tro@@ upe .
he had the view of the whole while many others were busy with himself .
V@@ idal therefore , to re@@ play his lack of fitness ( hardly worked ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches thus , on de@@ vil@@ s , come out to the accompli@@ sh@@ ments of the Asia trip ( also fol@@ kl@@ ets only condition@@ ally ) ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ are thus not having a negative impact in their first appearance in the Bavaria Tri@@ k@@ ot .
after all this worked very well .
Sü@@ ver ran beside Kim@@ me , Rud@@ y off the defense , both acted confi@@ dently .
the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli stor@@ my was often difficult , in addition , Sü@@ me@@ g also tried to successfully settle for a couple of times in the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his colleague Rud@@ y admitted that the result was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not as we hoped for . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance at his debut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; game shift , tempo change : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this style , I have been picked up too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how unusual this Bavaria world is still for the newcom@@ ers , one saw in the connection to the game .
Rud@@ y , for example , did not have one or two interviews in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , but determined six or seven interviews .
Kim@@ i said good@@ bye after a few cris@@ p@@ y say@@ ings in the back of his new fellow players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there he heard von Sü@@ ver an interesting sentence : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what &apos;s going on here , I have already noticed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Bavaria , you just have to win every game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , he no longer has to teach the new .

company satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Minister : business lau@@ ds Wis@@ sing Tempo
it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economic Affairs of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
this is evident after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chambers and companies from the region are talking about changes in economic policy on the T V request - and at the same time the old ministers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Frank nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Free Enterprise ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; Wis@@ sing takes up the wishes of the economy , which Lem@@ ke has all blocked . &quot;
the biggest revers@@ al of the revers@@ al sees nat@@ us in infrastructure policy : the gap between the highway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the country &apos;s priority list .
this year the ministry hopes for a planning procedure until 2021 is intended to be the construction law .
a role in the plans of the country also plays a role in the West &apos;s en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ement of Trier , which is in the ob@@ tru@@ sive needs of the Federal Transport Plan .
the goal is to put the track into operation in December 2020 , says Mini@@ steri@@ al spokes@@ woman Cornelia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
nat@@ us sees it as a sign for supporting regional , but internationally competitive companies .
the Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( I@@ HK ) is seeking , as suggested by Wis@@ sing , with wine a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate @-@ Label , in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German exports that had been sag@@ ging for ten years .
in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company , praise the Chamber of Commerce .
the Chamber of Cra@@ fts ( Trier ) sees in the new master bonus an additional incentive for young trainees , says CEO Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
a premium of 1,000 euros is planned for the passed master test and 2500 euros , if graduates make their own self @-@ employed within ten years after the Master &apos;s training .
but the home@@ work schedule for the country remains long .
with the planned road construction , facts can quickly be created , at the same time lacking the country in the necessary staff , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , chief executive of the Chamber of Industry of Trier .
only 29 jobs have been occupied by 56 new engineers who want to hire Wis@@ sing at Landes@@ betrieb Mobility .
the Chamber of Industry calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices .
s &amp; D vice @-@ president Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf points out calculations of the Court of Audi@@ tors , the country has invested more than 20 million euros in 2017 and 2018 in the preservation of provincial roads .
Frank nat@@ us also expects a concept of the country to solve the shortage of skilled workers in the region .
the previous broad@@ band extension in the country is also so@@ ber@@ ing .
in 2016 , regional companies evaluated the power supply in an I@@ HK survey only with grade 3 .
they compl@@ ained about stock@@ ing Internet connections and break@@ downs .
the ex @-@ economic minister E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and still sits on the supervisory board of the wind power company Pro Wind .
the Green faction had left Lem@@ ke in April to become the President of a private university in Karlsruhe , where after four months she returned to the field because of dis@@ agreements .
Audi to change 85@@ 0,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers see themselves confronted with a counter reaction
one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW announced that it would offer to update the software in over 35@@ 0,000 vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the BMW Chairman said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more intelligent options as driving restrictions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; referring to European cities - including Munich where BMW is based - to ban or limit diesel vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the under@@ tak@@ ings as recall .
European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions rules .
but the nitrogen ox@@ ides that em@@ it diesel engines are considered carcin@@ o@@ gens and may cause asthma .
the cost of the car manufacturers , systems for neutr@@ al@@ ising the exhaust gases expelled by diesel vehicles , also increases , making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of ou@@ ting the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing the signs of the problem .
companies are trying to avoid the fault of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called shut @-@ off devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but driving back in normal driving conditions .
several Volkswagen employees were indic@@ ted in the United States , while others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former leader of Ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ik was arrested in Germany by Audi .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ ch@@ eo Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is Italian and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be brought to court in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations in Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of installing a system to circum@@ vent emissions regulations in Europe , and an inquiry focused on the United States was expanded .
Audi &apos;s involvement in the study could seriously pol@@ lu@@ te Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes dispro@@ portion@@ ately to Volkswagen &apos;s win .

Mor@@ dil@@ los N@@ ases and the laughter against the suffering
Mor@@ di@@ llo was at times one of the most popular cartoon characters , the n@@ oses of his characters are his trademark .
even with 85 the Argent@@ ine@@ an is still drawing and working on a film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his message : laughter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; For there is too much suffering in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist , he was among other things a drau@@ gh@@ ts@@ man for greeting cards - which frustr@@ ated him .
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he said once .
after stations in Lima , New York and Paris , the breakthrough came to him at the end of the 60s : with the release of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match &quot; and then also in the &quot; Star &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China , Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
again and again the artist was inspired by cities .
large , ro@@ un@@ dish mor@@ di@@ llo figures cav@@ ort in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning , according to his own indications , he still sits at the table , works almost ten hours a day .
over cal@@ endar@@ s , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush favorites and clo@@ cks , his funny figures continue to be widely distributed worldwide .
for six years he has also worked on cartoon animation and a TV series with his characters .
the protagon@@ ist in the film &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los most popular animal in his drawings - which has an exchange @-@ foot@@ er as a counter @-@ player .
for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D movie , which is to come to the cinema screen in 2019 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the script is not written by him .
that &apos;s why he rather sits on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced wor@@ dless .
la@@ ven@@ der threatened by climate change in Provence
it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .
the la@@ ven@@ der is declining because of the conditions remin@@ ding of dro@@ ught and insect @-@ borne insects , leading scientists and farmers trying to find solutions , causing great head@@ aches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , expert in the CRI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M agricultural research institute in Provence , said : &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively com@@ promised because in recent years the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change , which in spring brought much less rain and in autumn a lot more .
this has an impact on the life of la@@ ven@@ der .
there is also a small Zi@@ k@@ ade , a micro bacter@@ ium that transm@@ its d@@ warf c@@ ages , and in very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and much is at stake .
la@@ ven@@ der oil attracts not only holi@@ day@@ makers , it is also very popular for perf@@ ume and cosmetics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eric Cha@@ isse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of having very long guns with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weakened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot;
the solutions that are considered include better water distribution and the slow@@ ing of evap@@ oration from the ground , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective mix of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dro@@ ught .
the town of Gei@@ sa in the Thurin@@ gian r@@ hö@@ n is celebrating its 1200 year anniversary this year .
the point of departure is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival .
shop@@ keepers , guil@@ ds , traders , vag@@ initi@@ s or a district army are to be experienced in the city centre these days .
the assass@@ ination of a journalist highlights the growing threat in Mexico
the staff of the weekly newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce usually meet on Wedn@@ es@@ days to check their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the State of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and ce@@ as@@ eless drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
they were told that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ level journalists are discussing what is more secure : they are supposed to take their children into the office , which in 2009 were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades , or leave them home .
security experts have written three words on a tablet at the front of the room : opponents , Neut@@ ral , Al@@ lies .
they ask the re@@ porters to propose names for each column - no evidence is needed , percep@@ tions and gut feelings .
there are drug smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of standing on the salary list of the government or cart@@ els , a catalog of criminals who make the Chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no rest from violence , and while the cor@@ p@@ ses are accum@@ ulating throughout the country , there are more and more journalists : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to res@@ ig@@ ned in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are after attacks and threats under federal law and until now there have been at least seven dead in seven states this year .
among the latter is their editor and inspir@@ ator by Ri@@ odo@@ ce , co @-@ founder of J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence is felt deep , although his presence is present everywhere - a great picture of Val@@ dez , which shows his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; hangs on the facade of the Fe@@ odo@@ ce building . two re@@ porters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez , wear t @-@ shirts which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ porters discuss their shared themes , the trauma , their night@@ mares , in@@ som@@ nia , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although a special At@@ tor@@ ney Office was established in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists , it has initiated only two criminal proceedings , according to the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists .
as with most of the thousands of mur@@ ders linked to drug traffi@@ cking and organised crime every year , journalists are rarely placed in court .
at Ri@@ odo@@ ce , they still ins@@ ist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are in@@ con@@ sol@@ ete and although the terrain is now even more tra@@ itor .
without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting for discussion of security has little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it &apos;s very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we don &apos;t know why , we mi@@ str@@ ust everyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the morning of 15 May Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the provincial capital of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
he managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him , presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; T@@ wel@@ ve river . &quot;
the sho@@ oter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
ru@@ mo@@ urs tend to fly freely in c@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
but on the subject of Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest last year and the delivery to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country as rival fac@@ tions are fighting here to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a one or more people are shot on the street every day or that the cemetery full of decorated , two @-@ storey m@@ aus@@ ole@@ ums for drug kings , which are larger than many homes for the living .
forget for a minute that there is a state of tranquility when only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable har@@ bours and drug trade routes in the United States .
despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , broke the blame for not protecting his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings contributed to the murder .
first of all , in February the publication of an interview with Damascus Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival cart@@ el frac@@ tions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons .
this release may have anno@@ yed the children , suspected gang@@ sters also bought each copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second mistake was to not force Val@@ dez after sei@@ zing another newspaper that had published the same story to leave the country for its own security .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and its killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived for so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he was always there .
he worked as an experienced re@@ porter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to establish Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars in equity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to run journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the drugs problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
over time , the newspaper earned a reputation for the courageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased .
re@@ porters loved being able to publish hard @-@ hitting research without fear of cens@@ orship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dar@@ ed to deal with .
eight years after the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Prize &quot; for her coverage in Latin America .
in the same year Val@@ dez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the protection of journalists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drug history , wherever she led .
he volunte@@ ered to be afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to live on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J distinction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; drug traffi@@ cking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a way of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must take over the task which you as a journalist falls - either that or you play the dum@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what have you done in the face of so many dead ... why did you not tell what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Fe@@ odo@@ ce team mis@@ ses Val@@ dez , the sp@@ awn @-@ bird , who could curse like a do@@ ck@@ worker , a friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
he would always go to El Gui@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sit on the same table there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they ask , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Was his love of the routine be his destruction ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how they can best do their job and stay alive .
&quot; you don &apos;t like it when you deal with their women , their children , their clean stores , their sne@@ e@@ zing run@@ ways to move drugs .
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation .
trust his own inst@@ inc@@ ts .
if it sm@@ ells in@@ correctly , stay away from it .
the anger is , said the publisher of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real that &quot; sm@@ ells a sense that can be fo@@ ol@@ ed ... and then the thing happened to J@@ avier . &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other countries where a toxic blend of lu@@ cr@@ ative smu@@ g@@ gling , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home .
the landscape changes constantly .
in the space where the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce met for safety training , no cell phones suddenly were allowed . days before it became known that Spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside two polic@@ emen were looking for protection against the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a mid @-@ range district of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
half in the joke , some of the re@@ porters asked themselves if these officers belong to the 50 percent of the police officers whom the governor himself called not trust@@ worthy .
it has been months since the re@@ porters have gone into the mountain landscape where drug gangs are de facto under control .
for the edition of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ce was star@@ ing on three main stories .
there was the assass@@ ination of the brother of the former known Box@@ er Juli@@ o C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an expos@@ é to the state spending that focused on the home town of the governor .
and there was a group living in one of the most expensive restaurants in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an , a block from the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office , kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped , or what happened , so be caution when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favorite local drug dealer and government .
a re@@ porter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian who belonged to the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which almost conquered all the political levels almost the whole century .
recently several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ cali@@ ber cases of corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ porter to write about previous incidents in this pub , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military assault .
only a few months earlier , the readers of Val@@ dez were considered the best informed source of the kidn@@ apping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier we had known what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of his slender body stat@@ ure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now all channels of communication are broken with our sources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the office of Val@@ dez has been re@@ devoted to the storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers which protest against the murder of journalists , because the employees have become something they never expected : activists in the name of the press .
re@@ porter Mi@@ ri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez grab@@ bed a few signs and went next morning to a demonstration for another journalist for the office of the prosec@@ utor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burned body has been discovered and officials say based on DNA testing that it is its .
journalists have become more vocal all over the country by writing in organized protests &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; on walk@@ ways and buildings .
on that day , director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington and tries to raise international support for the Val@@ dez case .
during a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , R@@ ami@@ rez accused the authorities to spy on journalists and kill them because they told the truth .
since then she has asked her to be sub@@ divided again by the government because she is concerned that her anger has viol@@ ated her objec@@ tivity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime , involved government officials and a valid society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in his last book , &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that re@@ porters were not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the orders of politicians and security forces infected with organised crime under a blanket .
the Media Group &quot; Ar@@ ticul@@ o 19 &quot; has over half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials .
&quot; in Mexico you die , because they want you to keep your mouth , &quot; said R@@ ami@@ rez .
obviously , the mur@@ ders have a deter@@ rent effect .
nobody for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her body was found along with a note that was allegedly signed by the Z@@ et@@ as cart@@ el : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a computer keyboard and headphones were beside their separate head .
some branches have chosen to close , as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assass@@ ination of the correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue to do as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the assass@@ ination of their director in 2004 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly hosted the drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the title page titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile and they still watch the streets and look for dangers .
and sometimes they are hun@@ ted as it seems to the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the flight from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who remain behind and continue the work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , ad@@ mits that drug traffi@@ cking is frigh@@ tened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico goes to hell , and that &apos;s why I became a re@@ porter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk in front of the office and d@@ rank beer when all their phones began to bu@@ zz .
a number of fights with Band@@ en@@ riv@@ els and security forces near the spa town Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war continued to escal@@ ate as promised by a series of cart@@ el em@@ bas@@ sies in the region .
from the cur@@ b edge , they published the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce via mobile phone .
the title page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens how@@ l nearby - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez drew a look at the police officers who kept guards to see if they were willing .
if they were afraid , they did not show it .
under the enormous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for the whole of Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his foot@@ steps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you just think about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If on the same day J@@ avier was murdered , the practitioner asked me to send her to the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ r used cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to ev@@ ade enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue , albeit a frigh@@ tening one .
now researchers have discovered that the first findings of the incredible N@@ ash@@ or@@ ns of a Canadian mining worker have been so well preserved that experts described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa der Din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so well received that they could even find that his sc@@ aly skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said that she had had something of a &quot; troubled past . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report in the magazine &quot; Current Biology &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; described it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the preserved din@@ osau@@ r ever found , and one of the world &apos;s best din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered species of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier which lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
its incredibly well @-@ preserved state has amazed researchers who describe it as &quot; truly remarkable , &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es is the best preserved fossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk when he arrived at the S@@ unc@@ or Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , on March 21 , 2011 .
he met what seemed to be out of place from the surrounding rock , and decided to take a closer look .
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years covering the wild animal within the 2,500 l@@ bs@@ . ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy earth @-@ cl@@ ump@@ ing .
after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you b@@ link only a little with the eyes , you could almost believe it slept , &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum where the creature is to be seen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ r copies - Mon@@ a Lisa is the Din@@ osau@@ rier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
researchers have found out that this her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es , although it is covered with an arm@@ or and resembles a changing tank , is probably threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs .
the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to hide from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technology , which is known as anti@@ sh@@ ading , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed to get better into his surroundings and ev@@ ade his enemies , experts predict that it was threatened by major din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million year old creature from the family of the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier made head@@ lines in May and is now to be seen at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied wild animals and called it Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli to the museum engineer Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team who has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours to carefully uncover it .
the astonishing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and arm@@ or over his body .
they discovered the counter @-@ sh@@ ading , a widespread defence method in the animal kingdom , which means that the tip of the creature was dark@@ er than its under@@ side .
although the sh@@ ad@@ owing is common , the results are surprising as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta by far exceeds that of today living animals .
it suggests that the din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by sufficient pressure by meat @-@ eating din@@ osau@@ rs , that the evolution fav@@ ored the conce@@ al@@ ment of the confrontation as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals , who use the counter @-@ sh@@ ading , think of deer , zeb@@ ras or ar@@ ma@@ dil@@ los - are much smaller and more vulnerable than loo@@ t , which signals that this dos@@ sier was exposed to a real struggle for survival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; powerful pre@@ dat@@ ory behavior on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs must have been the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also indicates that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
scientists continue to investigate the animal on clu@@ es about his life , including his preserved intestinal content , to find out what it had eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , got into a river and driven out into the sea , where he sank on the back to the bottom of the sea .
at that time Alber@@ ta was as warm as South Fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably far@@ ther far@@ ther inland than they are today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this dos@@ dos@@ er is really remarkable , because it is completely covered with preserved sc@@ aly skin but also preserves in three dimensions and preserves the original form of the animal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that today the animal looks almost exactly the same as in the early C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you do not need to use much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you only look a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that it is sleeping . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period was a time when huge thermal di@@ odes , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs standing on two legs crossed the earth .
although the King of them , who lived Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Re@@ x , millions of years to Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his terri@@ fying ancestors .
this includes the ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monster .
the scientists , whose latest findings appear in the professional journal Current Biology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the sea and was m@@ um@@ i@@ ated in mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he arrived at the S@@ unc@@ or Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , on March 21 , 2011 .
according to the museum , it is the best arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r in the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip .
the creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips prot@@ ru@@ ding from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es have been swe@@ pt through the western Canada until a flooded river floo@@ ds into the open sea .
but the under@@ sea equipment of the din@@ osau@@ r kept its arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of this special specimen are preserved so well that the house st@@ alli@@ ons still cover b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates along the din@@ osau@@ r .
as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of conservation is as rare as winning the Lotto .
the more I see it , the more conf@@ using it becomes .
pet@@ ri@@ fied residues of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates that carry the skull of the animal .
his right foref@@ oot is on his side , his five fingers are spread upwards .
I can count the scales at his sole . &quot;
in the storm : massacre of Mass@@ enk@@ ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many wounded
heavy accident on Thursday night on the A@@ 8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass car@@ bol@@ age .
there are numerous wounded , miles long St@@ aus - and G@@ aff@@ er .
at the Stuttgart @-@ München ( A@@ 8 ) motorway , about 20 people were injured during a massacre of around 20 people on Thursday afternoon .
according to the police , at 5 pm there were about 30 cars between the connecting offices Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( County A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm , almost 30 vehicles , among them trucks , crashed into each other .
at first no information was given about the exact number of injuries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a matter of light to moderate injury , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large range of rescue vehicles was at the accident site .
the A@@ 8 was completely blocked in direction to Munich .
in the direction of Munich , an approximately ten kilometres long rear @-@ traffic was formed .
as an A@@ Z re@@ porter reports , there was also on the opposite road to massive disabilities - through numerous g@@ aff@@ er .
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade noti@@ fies themselves the characteristics of the vehicle drivers who now have to reck@@ on with sensitive pen@@ alties .
shortly after 18 : 45 a second accident occurred on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a collision between a car transpor@@ ter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident .
Deutsche Bahn : company tests &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has already experienced : nothing surprising is in the train and sleeps .
or one is deep@@ ened into his work and has just a brilliant mind .
and then : buffer .
comes the conductor and ar@@ ouses an uns@@ us@@ p@@ ecting or tears the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
ticket inspection .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are soon over .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing ground@@ less ticket inspection .
it is simply confirmed by mobile phone that you take your seat and thus vali@@ date the ticket .
currently , a test run runs on two routes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; come the offer , we expand it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will probably be available early next year on many other long @-@ haul routes in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a railway @-@ speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the name of the rail@@ road de@@ valuation without Schaff@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be able to use it , however , some requirements must be fulfilled : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to book an online ticket - what already most passengers do .
it is also necessary to have the app of the train which DB Navigator must have bought , which anyway is the most convenient way of booking .
last but not least you need a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works : one gets into the train , calls his ticket to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the case of the test customers , then a button for the electronic de@@ valuation will appear .
the train atten@@ d@@ ants get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat Y .
if the train atten@@ dant comes to place Y at the ticket inspec@@ tor lane , he knows that there is a passenger with an already vali@@ dated online ticket .
so you can go on sleeping , working on , keep silent .
the &quot; check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should take advantage of the passengers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who wants to travel relaxed without ticket inspection by our train atten@@ dant , simply checks in the DB Navigator himself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this allows the passengers to person@@ alize their travel time in the train , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , DB long @-@ distance marketing board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; second Plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to the individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who travel often know that in addition to delays and missed trains , ticket controls are one of the biggest off@@ ences .
because often you have , in any case , one of the co @-@ travelers not all the documents you need to de@@ grade online tickets .
either the credit card or the identity card is missing or otherwise a document that must be presented .
the result is endless discussions between train atten@@ d@@ ants and passenger , which leads to bad mood in the ab@@ sent@@ ee or greater space and delays in controlling their own tickets and takes the conductor to take care of other matters at the end .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and that applies only to ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further train numbers on the same route are not yet un@@ locked .
how an activ@@ ist got to learn the answer to the question : &quot; wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 Britt@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was sha@@ ken to its core .
just one day after she arrived in New York City , the apartment in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment she rented and sc@@ rolled by Facebook on her telephone .
she stum@@ bled over a mail from someone from high school .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police just killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old child , and it is still on the street , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused , nobody else posted the information on her feed , she closed fac@@ ebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly saved on her tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was twe@@ eting live twe@@ ets the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old who was killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo .
he posted a picture of Brow@@ ns &apos;s lifel@@ ess body stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours .
&quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l thought .
but death was nothing new to them and their community .
she turned her mobile phone to return later in the evening to T@@ we@@ ets about people on the Can@@ field Drive .
there were photos of police bands and people crying out , and by a man who claimed to be a father &apos;s father who bore a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on &apos;s police just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she watched a live feed where a polic@@ eman was standing in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog .
in another video , she said , ass@@ uring another polic@@ eman being his ri@@ f@@ le , crying , &quot; I &apos;m going to kill you ... all of you killing animals . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not usual , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l rec@@ alled her statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder we have used to and which we can call typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that moment I felt ch@@ ills .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was angry and wept . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after the landing at 11@@ pm , she picked up her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning .
what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on is the theme of a new documentary , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cin@@ emas from the 11th .
it is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resili@@ ence that exists from the point of view of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers .
when Fer@@ rel@@ l came to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on with her daughter , who wore a flower dress and a suitable crown , the two had a conversation , which they had &quot; black experience and the black state &quot; innum@@ erable times before this morning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that was not right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I couldn &apos;t take her away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l said later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what happened today is a cul@@ mination of what happened in the past .
it must know it and see it and be drawn up in it .
it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution , and what we have to do to free ourselves to free ourselves .
even though I have the luck to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience blat@@ ant racism , she is no different from the next black women child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel I would be a bad service to keep them away from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first station , when they arrived at F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority who became a camp area when the activists waited for the possible non @-@ prosecution of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter joined a local business@@ man who had lunch .
they prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new type of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rel@@ l .
&quot; my activ@@ ism changed completely after August 9 , &quot; she said and noticed that she was President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ se Association as a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis and focused on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black commun@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had no experience in organising . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s all come . &quot;
weeks later Fer@@ rel@@ l met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an during an evening demonstration , one of the co @-@ directors of the film .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r wanted to &quot; document &quot; what happened .
one question came to Fer@@ rel@@ l : &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story you can take advantage of ? &quot;
this skep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often of wh@@ ites - in a community which benefited from their pain and resistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on did not center their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an already collabor@@ ated with the co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around death stra@@ in@@ ers .
his engagement brought Fer@@ rel@@ l closer to the project , along with six other natives the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; followed in the years after Brown &apos;s shooting .
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us . we &apos;re talking , &quot; Davis said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the main thing for me as these people are portra@@ yed , for this is how I shall be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to concentrate on Ferr@@ is &apos;s experience - to show that the movement &quot; is not a m@@ essi@@ ah leader , but a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it proved to be the most open participant in the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , documents from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are surprisingly personal aspects of Ferr@@ is &apos;s life , how she falls in love and mar@@ ries her wife . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l said and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that there must be some vulner@@ ability in this work and in the human@@ ization of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Ferr@@ ell &apos;s history repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the wider Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three founders of the movement following the killing of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 identified the film &quot; Black@@ live Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identified as gay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have worn the movement overall , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we are constantly struggling on different fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women must bear the main burden of everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not an affir@@ m@@ ative type of action , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Fer@@ rel@@ l was chosen as the heart of the film because of her identity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was the person who stir@@ red up this energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not a coincidence , although it was at the forefront because in a life at these cross@@ ings as a black , gay woman is so much at stake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you can sense your energy through the screen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the meantime , the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long since disappeared , but the racial connections between the church and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rel@@ l is on par@@ ole for 2 ½ years because of the blocking of a motorway at a demonstration .
it describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area they call their home : &quot; chaos . &quot;
yet she cl@@ ings to a song and she feels bound to this memory , since she went on the street three years ago in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we must love and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; : TV viewers discuss bit @-@ gallery
the bit gallery moves people even though they are not built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping centre at the southern end of the pedestrian prec@@ inct spl@@ its the population into pro@@ pon@@ ents and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .
the theme hardly leaves one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the one to the bit gallery say , &quot; That would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; That would be great &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; don &apos;t need a person &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or quite simply : &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) .
while the pro@@ pon@@ ents build that a gallery will attract more customers into the city , from what the other stores also profit , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone ble@@ eds .
in addition , the gallery is planned precisely on the grounds where the farmer &apos;s market hall stands , in which 13 direct market@@ ers offer their products .
at the beginning of the construction work will be finished .
the Gallery @-@ makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Bed@@ a square with a possibility to sit outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Simone Room : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have been shopping for many years almost a week in the farmer &apos;s market hall . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the rural women are very happy again and again .
we also discovered the but@@ cher &apos;s shop for us .
we would like to see that even during and , especially after the construction of the gallery , there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities , there is that too .
especially the Klein@@ mark@@ thalle in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct marketing will settle in a market hall in the gallery depends on the amount of rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this should probably not be very low in the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why shopping palette in Bit@@ burg ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether it &apos;s clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets , I don &apos;t think it is superf@@ lu@@ ous .
there are enough of them in our city .
you can see how many shops here are empty - some for months and years .
but as there is not even a regular weekly market , it is all the more important that at least the market hall will be preserved .
after all , the goods offered there are fresh , is mostly offered directly by the producer and is cheap at the top .
as you can see , shop shops are rented in a shopping mall only by bigger companies , because the r@@ ents there are often not portable for a retailer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; too bad , there are almost no special deals and what is left of it will probably disappear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping mall with a market hall doesn &apos;t fit together for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
first of all : where should the farmer &apos;s market hall look like during the construction period ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even in the long run if the bit gallery actually actually comes .
or does the gh@@ ost bit gallery ever manage to drive all the stores from Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; George Mar@@ quet : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will simply not work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and a shopping center , which stands empty , no one needs .
in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real farmer &apos;s market instead of this gallery .
but for a farmer &apos;s market hall , thanks to the ins@@ ane many - as I find - sen@@ sel@@ ess building projects in Bit@@ burg have no place anymore .
when the farmer &apos;s market hall is broken down , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
in the middle of the space of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces are visible - white , black and brown , almost im@@ percep@@ ti@@ bly alike - hanging on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ fern and Haar@@ etz , which were sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison , where the former secret service analy@@ st served a 35 @-@ year prison term after publicly tra@@ iled diplomatic reports on Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition , which was opened on August 2 , is called A Bec@@ oming resem@@ b@@ lance .
she is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline agreed her expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ duc@@ er and pioneering female student , whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama , when he had only three days in his office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg originated from the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA extracted from man@@ ing and created out of 30 portraits , as anyone could look with these gen@@ om@@ ic data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also for identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but has already spoken openly about identification as a woman since pu@@ ber@@ ty , was condemned in 2013 for 20 charges , including six violations of the es@@ pi@@ on@@ age law , computer fraud and theft .
through the prison her image was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing obviously sits un@@ well on a driver &apos;s seat and carries a plat@@ inum @-@ blonde wig - with which she was associated .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg just came from the great success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
in this , the artist produced portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ sic art@@ ef@@ acts , like cigarette but@@ t and ch@@ ewing gum , extrac@@ ting the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people could look like .
that was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press review of the new exhibition .
and she could not be photograph@@ ed at that time and she could not be photograph@@ ed , so they contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her imprisoned M@@ use have become un@@ equal brid@@ les , which in the course of two years inter@@ changed several letters .
they even created a comic &quot; Supp@@ ressed Image , &quot; illustrated by Sho@@ ili @-@ Kan@@ ung@@ o , which predicted a future in which the President would convert Chel@@ seas judgment and would be able to see the exhibition in person .
that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as was a welcome kind of happy meeting .
there is also now something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Tru@@ mp leads a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender forces to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to keep the rigid circuits that he should actually fix .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked for the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; things are going to happen for a particular reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a artistic statement written down on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing called for an end to the &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , whose foundation was gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall is its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ ler of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg waited to show by the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des according to the highly developed scientific en@@ cyclo@@ pedia of the artist ) how amaz@@ ingly similar , at least in a biological way , we are all .
&quot; what hopefully will bring people with it is that our gen@@ ome does not care who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work from 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , is also to be seen .
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in its own space , is a page from the above @-@ mentioned Com@@ ic @-@ Nov@@ elle .
she shows Mann@@ ing as she emerges from the discipline of the United States like King Kong with a hands @-@ free hands @-@ on phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they ask your question , then they have won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so never stop the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist , who gre@@ ets from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ um@@ ps when I talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if it was supposed to do , then it will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ ons , which gather like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
this was also target @-@ orientated , like everything in the exhibition , up to size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ ature ) , where their genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with a pencil .
&quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , like the movement that was also behind its liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor at the University Nor@@ th@@ western and an employee of Oxford University because of killing
a nationwide crowd @-@ hunting is underway for a professor at Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee at Oxford University who was looked for as susp@@ ects after a man was stab@@ bed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago .
on Monday , arrest warran@@ ts were issued for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) for murder due to their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as the acts of Cook County regional court show .
the documents say Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 died after several stit@@ ches .
a common warning system published by the Chicago police authority states that the cor@@ p@@ se was discovered on 27 July .
officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries on his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was declared dead at the site of the action and det@@ ec@@ tives examine the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police are actively looking for the two susp@@ ects , officials said .
she has been professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at Nor@@ th@@ western University since 2007 .
Alan K. Cub@@ iner@@ , the vice @-@ president for university relations , said in an e @-@ mail explanation that La@@ them was now in a be@@ aut@@ y@@ ful way and had been expelled from entering the Nor@@ th@@ western University campus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal issue investigated by the competent authorities , and Nor@@ th@@ western University collabor@@ ates on this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wilson . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
a speaker at the University and Somer@@ ville College said in an email explaining that &quot; we are in contact with the UK police and are ready to help the US investig@@ ative authorities in any way possible . &quot;
the statement added that War@@ ren &apos;s colleagues were shocked and want him to be .
chief Communications Officer of the Chicago police authority , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he strongly insist@@ ed on the susp@@ ects to face the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate them reinforce , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said local , regional and national authorities help to locate the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police got a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building , who had just received an en@@ ig@@ matic tip saying that something happened in apartment 10@@ 08 .
the police described the scene as very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27 .
it was confirmed by security cameras that them@@ self and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management team at Grand Plaza announces a statement to the residents : &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and background of the victim and resear@@ ches a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will complete the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Russian vice @-@ president Mut@@ ko &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Russian Vice President Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t take long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) are implemented to restore the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( R@@ USA@@ DA ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ USA@@ DA has the right to plan and test in collaboration with UK@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the WA@@ DA road@@ map was updated in this respect , &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday .
the PM commented on the second part of WA@@ DA road@@ map to comply with the code , which describes the criteria for re @-@ establishing the USA@@ ID and was recently published on the organization &apos;s website .
according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything was announced , everything is being implemented . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; he added .
however , one of the criteria mentioned in the list states that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the study approved by the WA@@ DA by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren to publicly subsidi@@ zed dop@@ ing in Russian sports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in terms of the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation because our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has conf@@ essed a mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no state programmes , and we won &apos;t give something that does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mut@@ ant &apos;s words agreed with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the leader of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing Commission .
in conversation with the Russian sales point r@@ sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ nov delivered problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no one has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in November 2015 , in the course of the dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , R@@ USA@@ DA was excluded from the carrying out of dop@@ ing controls in Russia in the course of the dop@@ ing sc@@ andal .
however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ( UK@@ AD ) .
after a visit to Moscow &apos;s headquarters in July , WA@@ DA general manager Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli stated that the USA@@ ID was &quot; moving in the right direction &quot; to be re @-@ used .
Al@@ di does not sell eggs for the time being

it was a mere precau@@ tion , it could not be further assumed by any health impair@@ ment , it was said in the message .
from now on only eggs should be delivered to Al@@ di , which have been demonstr@@ ably tested negative on fi@@ pron@@ il@@ ous anti @-@ lum@@ ps .

the start @-@ ups that will help your company to become the next U@@ ber
A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to make your employees happy with your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the surveys didn &apos;t work .
answers were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or - worse - dec@@ eit@@ ful .
and even if you promised anonym@@ ity , some workers did not trust the process .
&quot; there was never consistency and objec@@ tivity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care Company Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed .
she sum@@ mon@@ ed people from the outside for help .
a new Human Resources Start @-@ up race is at the look@@ out to help companies find out how their employees feel .
through the creation and licensing of software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement , it enables companies to conduct surveys , offer special groups and demographic groups , to address employees anonym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases , W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers allow managers to b@@ ypass managers and turn directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; you now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for tracking your health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement .
Er@@ ret@@ t said they got a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years won with G@@ lin@@ t .
in addition to the Sn@@ ap Sur@@ ve@@ ys and Sur@@ ve@@ ys of certain teams , it offers a heat card of the company , which shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which managers have low feedback results - so you can drill down , why .
companies are coming to see that they have to remain at the head of the workplace culture so that you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment in which those who have spoken have been punished .
for start @-@ ups like G@@ lin@@ t , this wish is an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity .
the global governance , regulation and compliance industry could be worth more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion by 2020 according to the Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments website .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent bad behavior and to recognize , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year amid the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
conver@@ cent has nearly 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
the client recently signed up as a client .
as G@@ lin@@ t , Con@@ ver@@ cent enables companies to send customized &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect sensitive answers in real time , and view the heat maps of your problem areas .
it also provides an anonymous SMS hot@@ line that allows employees to report bad behavior .
and when the chief executive officer is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; the court of public opinion has captured the regul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , founder and CEO of Con@@ ver@@ cent .
when a company is found that deals badly with its employees or beha@@ ves un@@ eth@@ ically , it can experience costly consequences through consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee fluctu@@ ation and complaints , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
Ru@@ by Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites , has used Con@@ ver@@ cent for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of politics and procedures and have a simple way to reach their headquarters .
earlier , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or email for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously .
it was often a intim@@ id@@ ation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by TU@@ ES@@ DA@@ Y@@ S General Co@@ uns@@ el who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees .
now , as the company Con@@ ver@@ cent uses , problems that have previously been hidden by leaders sitting in offices in cities or states have been identified and addressed - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair inter@@ ns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can approach this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view into the experience with employment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who heads the Risk Management Group of Ru@@ by Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment disputes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies began to take Eth@@ ics , Val@@ ues and Emplo@@ ye@@ es &apos; Com@@ mit@@ ment in 2002 , after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed because of ethical bre@@ aches by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social media came to their right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry going online . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both G@@ lin@@ t and Con@@ ver@@ cent offer your software as a service , and charge the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance to find the approval of Venture Capital investors who have supported both start @-@ ups .
Con@@ ver@@ cent received $ 10 million in funding in February of firms like S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , raising the total capital to $ 47 million .
gl@@ itz@@ ers secured $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners , bringing total funding to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising given the connected nature of businesses , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees are expecting more from their jobs than before .
in competitive markets like Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only missions .
the employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; when people are happy to be in a company that &apos;s worth their voices , and that the work that you do is worth doing , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which uses both Con@@ ver@@ cent and G@@ lin@@ t .
investors gain yields when their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are committed and committed .
if the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data about employee engagement in accordance with the experts in the workplace culture is important .
but the data are useless if the administrators of a company do not take action .
in fact , when a company asks employees for your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way .
and if the change does not come fast enough , or not at all , it can grow dis@@ appointments and demo@@ tiv@@ ate employees .
&quot; if you ask for 4000 comments , you need to be ready to have 4,000 talks , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management firm of Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies that have too much rely on collecting data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you will not follow employee , ask yourself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about it ?
and if you don &apos;t care about it , why should I ? &quot;
Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now conduc@@ ts monthly employee surveys , was able to initiate measures on the same day , when a problem is reported about G@@ lin@@ t , saving .
and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , it was able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems .
at Ru@@ by Tuesday , the company gets new insights into employees and hopes that in the long run , this leads to a better bonding of employees in an industry known for high turnover .
&quot; if you are not oblig@@ ated to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; said Vit@@ rano .
&quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers .
and if you lose customers , then you will lose your business .
the N@@ CA@@ A removes the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the Bru@@ ins
it starts at 11 p.m. when a lot of U@@ CL@@ A football players talk to the campus on one side of the new practice areas of the team .
some have pulled out their tri@@ cot upper parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team , these idle minutes are a lunch break .
players who are en@@ rolled in the summer courses will return to their final examinations after the three @-@ hour practice before returning to the Water@@ man Football Center the next morning at 6 : 30@@ h .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real treadmill for the guys the next three days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ ck @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before the Monday became a Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day exercises to ease the load of the players , and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three U@@ CL@@ A training sessions should start at 7 : 15 p.m. to meet the already fully packed schedule of the players .
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day in which the Bru@@ ins postpon@@ ed the start of the camp almost one week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as performed six seasons in West@@ wood practical exercises .
20 before beginning of formal preparations for their pr@@ el@@ ude to Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he supported the amend@@ ment of N@@ CA@@ A even if they add another point to the busy routes of the players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous burden on them three or four days , and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they just crossed it , they were going to plac@@ ate , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will be really great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U@@ CL@@ A will end its practices as soon as the camp is finished , which is not an easy task given the clear lines of its fields from an adjacent car park and the bor@@ dering Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of up@@ scale class , which has already been thrown with foot@@ balls , which is a protective network behind a door pole , will not be an easy task .
Bru@@ ins should occupy the hotel this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far fet@@ ched to think that people are renting a room there and setting up there to record an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the video tape from an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good business .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking lot 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
that &apos;s why I don &apos;t worry too much .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts @-@ review in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with counter@@ fei@@ ters to third parties and then display their results below the original contribution , the world &apos;s largest online social network said on Thursday . it is one of its efforts to combat so @-@ called fake news .
the company told in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to detect potential false messages and to send them to fake messages that may display results of the fact examination from the original article .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many believe that they have influenced the U.S. presidential elections in 2016 .
the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with French voters over@@ flooded with false stories in the run @-@ up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany supports a plan to be punished according to social media networks , if they fail to quickly remove hat@@ eful posts as before the elections there in September .
on Thursday Facebook announced in a separate declaration in English that a test of the new facts check will be started in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany .
&quot; in addition to finding out which stories are challenged by third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara S@@ u , Product Manager for Facebook news in a blog .
she added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the &quot; related article &quot; and works on other changes to its news feed to reduce wrong messages .
creating a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his recent past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was to be seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margar@@ et T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ s and 1980 &apos;s .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from his cozy sitting in the Clou@@ dy River Valley in K@@ ent and now has become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a cosmop@@ olitan Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a fon@@ dness for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I find it so nice to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; covers the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scot@@ ney . each story has been illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Lenk@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des based on an archive : he wrote &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; in 2014 , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found un@@ expect@@ edly emotional .
&quot; I only responded to the thumb print on the side of a letter , written by a double agent in the 1700 &quot; s who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is his thumb print ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
and letters always smell of smoke , because at that time they lit a fire because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he was there himself .
Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is so beaten with old papers , that he was supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have over@@ rated my welcome greeting &quot; ) seems to be all too beautiful to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Vict@@ orian &quot; new &quot; castle , looking through the archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the walled hy@@ ena heads on the walls and bottles that had spent centuries in tren@@ ches .
he wander@@ ed through the grounds and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with coun@@ ties , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then , at night he d@@ rank &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whis@@ key and started writing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the intimate story of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , as the National Trust had only received full access in 2006 , when the last hei@@ ress , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees just started taking care of the archive that he described as &quot; hundreds of years in which aristoc@@ rats said &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; di@@ aries , letters from the time of the English Empire , maps depicting what possessed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch fighting for the two families . &quot; &quot; &quot;
boys , let everything go its way ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immer@@ se yourself in the English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; that follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record of a tur@@ mo@@ il that occurred in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book entitled &quot; Kni@@ fe Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex , &quot; Rho@@ des says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the peasant uprising began in this area and I thought an insurrection was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the two are inter@@ connected ? &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ terer who hid the Dar@@ rel@@ l family for seven years during the English re@@ formation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler &apos; , portra@@ yed by the smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l from the 18th century , who staged his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) .
the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos;s favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the guys seemed to be pretty cro@@ ok , getting debts and spending money for things they could not afford .
other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l &apos;s men ble@@ w their debt crises by mar@@ rying wealthy old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to promote land@@ mine . &quot;
after the end of his engagement in the castle , Rho@@ des is searching for other unique write experiences
he spent a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about E@@ lä@@ ju@@ mä@@ ki , the site of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ laimed by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to be done again with the dam@@ ned life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle envel@@ op@@ ed in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the un@@ v@@ eiling of the 301 @-@ year @-@ old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , Bad Honnef last Friday launched its campaign to introduce a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) .
mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team led by Nelson Ar@@ tz to keep the logo and the slogan secret until Thursday .
at the end of August there will be a celebration at Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th Island as the cul@@ mination of the campaign .
&quot; too beautiful for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; ask the makers of the action yesterday on the posters at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t really think that ( of course ! ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they write on their yesterday released website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but we use this measure to attract your attention .
and to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; basically , we are firmly convinced that we as Bad Honnef citizens will know very well about the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the action is about more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , so it goes on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to form@@ ulate a stand @-@ alone promise , one that gives the city a unique unique selling proposition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally , she stands in competition with other municipalities .
the city of Bad Honnef is an average five @-@ digit amount due to its new umbrella brand and campaign .
military reforms in Turkey - Erd@@ og@@ an &apos;s fear of the army
every year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) advises on pension schemes and promotions within the officers &quot; cor@@ ps .
so also this week .
at first sight a normal procedure .
but nothing is routine at the Turkish armed forces one year after the coup attempt .
the meeting was no longer held in the headquarters of the General Staff , as before , but in the seat of the Prime Minister .
at the meetings , under the chair@@ manship of the heads of government , the five Vice Premi@@ ers and the Minister for Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs also took part .
this was the result of civilians in the Y@@ AS .
the government is pulling the re@@ ins in the military .
chief of Staff , Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar , remains in office , but the com@@ man@@ ders of the army , the forces of air and the nav@@ y have been de@@ posed .
since the failed coup , President Erd@@ og@@ an has been firing 169 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged links to the movement of the exile @-@ pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who sees Erd@@ og@@ an as a wi@@ re@@ dee of the coup attempt .
against 4@@ 86 persons who have been involved immediately after the coup attempt will be negotiated in Ankara on this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day after the coup , Erd@@ og@@ an referred to the attempted coup as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; God &apos;s gift &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because he gave him the opportunity to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; completely clean@@ se the armed forces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but does Erd@@ og@@ an really have a grip on the army ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of February the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published an article titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Un@@ comfortable in the Military Head@@ quarters &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are concerns on the general staff because of an increasing &quot; Islam@@ isation &quot; of the army , which , among other things , mani@@ fests itself in the lifting of the head@@ sc@@ arf for soldiers , wrote the newspaper .
in any case , the great damage in the army and the security forces continues .
in mid @-@ July Erd@@ og@@ an ordered another 7@@ 3@@ 95 cou@@ ps , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
it seemed like Erd@@ og@@ an had t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als used to be the masters of the country earlier .
three times they shared their role as guar@@ dians of the secular state order .
following his election victory in 2002 , Erd@@ og@@ an pushed back the army &apos;s power step by step , not least by calling on the European Union &apos;s reform efforts .
former officers say Erd@@ og@@ an is pushing ahead with Islam@@ isation of the armed forces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a named officer who sought asylum from persecution abroad for fear of persecution abroad , the Turkish army would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ af@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if this is true , such a development could not leave NATO cold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in any case , there is doubt in the alliance for the pur@@ ge of doubt about the willingness of the Turkish army . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the leadership structures and operational abilities are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weakened &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington changes the Green Card rules
there will be a new US Immig@@ ration Plan to change the Green Card rules , said President Donald Tru@@ mp , quoted from the media .
it proposes to reduce legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules on obtaining vis@@ as for temporary work permit and restrictions on family @-@ based vis@@ as .
the new rules are proposed by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers and will do so by changing the way the US will change the way citizens from other countries are spending Green Cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent the chain migration and replace the current system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English , who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp , quoted by the American media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ministry wants to rehabil@@ itate track for Renn@@ stei@@ ra
over the past few months over the future of the Renn@@ stei@@ sh@@ utt@@ les has been fought - now it is supposed to be very fast .
even before the end of the year , it is planned to be built on the ailing track on which the tourist train runs .
in order to secure the future of the Renn@@ stei@@ sh@@ utt@@ les in the long term , construction work will start on the course this year , according to the Ministry of Transport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to continue to order and rehabil@@ itate Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country is committed to this particularly important link to tourism , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated travel secretary Klaus expi@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs for the repair of the track were about 2.5 million euros .
of this sum , the country over@@ sees 75 percent .
the contract , based on which the shuttle is to be ordered from the country in the future , is currently approved , declared Pun@@ ishment .
the Ministry and the South Thurin@@ gian Rail@@ ways as operators are already unanim@@ ous about the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this , the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said At@@ at@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
thus the race course shuttle should be ordered regul@@ arily in December 2017 .
the Renn@@ stei@@ g Shuttle is a railway connection between the stations of Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
over the past few months , it has been tested in the course of a pilot operation , whether the route is used by sufficient number of people to order them again in the future .
the track is also very b@@ ump@@ y in parts .
the ascension of sex robots is real , and we should worry
just as you thought it could not become even more crazy in 2017 , a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots is coming .
yes , in fact .
sex robots are currently a big deal .
the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( FR@@ R ) recently published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , Professor of Robotics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at She@@ ff@@ ield University and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we must start taking their Ascension seriously .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pp@@ le and the type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail .
&quot; people make fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of it , and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; said Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey on the publication of his new report .
modern sli@@ ps have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions which are achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the user can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adapt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his robot according to his beliefs and select everything from the eye color of the robot through the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or color of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it becomes even more disturbing , as many robots possess &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would make a step@@ ford woman look progressive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern exp@@ and@@ lips developed to robots with a silicone skin .
for example , the Real@@ Bo@@ ti@@ x robot enables its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness .
and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold Sex @-@ robot developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed characters like &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which conve@@ ys the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an &quot; adventurous &quot; personality .
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ x@@ gold has a personality adapted to your personality as much as possible , &quot; war@@ ms the True Compan@@ ion website .
so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
in the course of the day , it also has its mo@@ ods , just like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; she can be tired , fixed on conversation or she can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be in mood &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ servi@@ ent female features , the all@@ u@@ sions to rape , when one gets a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( means here : resist@@ ing ) Far@@ rah , troubled one the most .
on his site true companion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men not have Ro@@ xx@@ x@@ xis ? &quot; it says on the website .
however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just a different sex toy .
their formation and increasing sophistic@@ ation point to something dark@@ er and deeper in our culture , towards a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with subj@@ ection as optional addition .
most men will naturally have no sex robots , and while the FR@@ R re@@ members their rising popularity , they remain tent@@ atively at the edge of consumer culture .
but what transp@@ ires from the marginal zones can be very instruc@@ tive in terms of the spirit of time in which we live .
and many people are not strange or insul@@ ting until the free market gives them permission .
there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots are emerging in a time where women &apos;s rights are threatened around the world in which there is a president in the White House who has dar@@ ed to have women being sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted .
the most dre@@ ad@@ ful aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The report of the maid &apos; ) is not the graphic images , the inter@@ lac@@ ed body and the st@@ och@@ ed eyes , but how real@@ istically this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a jump , but at the moment this does not feel like a great leap .
the aim behind these sex robots is to create a physical lik@@ eness to actual women as real@@ istically as technically possible ( albeit with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their builders want them to feel human , that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but , to the point when it comes to its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the robots are not real women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away .
they have no mediation or background story , nothing that hin@@ ders independence or anything that might distur@@ b the imagination of total submission .
in other words , they are fake slaves .
or to put it in the saying of 2017 : maid
Tru@@ mp@@ s great power ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of common sense of man
it has become a tru@@ ism of the Tru@@ mp era that the political divisions , which pol@@ arized the U.S. elec@@ torate , have also split families in small formats .
around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving , there were newspapers in the USA with advice on how to deal with the horror of troub@@ lem@@ akers .
we all re@@ strain ourselves to make our filter bags burst .
less noticed is the power tru@@ mp , families to bring together .
I mention this because my cous@@ in , a po@@ orer poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York .
she reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
with Tru@@ mp in the White House everyone whom she knows , including the republi@@ can relationship with which she strug@@ gled for decades because of politics suddenly and very stran@@ gely on the same side .
this is certainly a good thing about the dining table , but it is important to me that this also ent@@ ails considerable risks .
the left was strengthened by Tru@@ mp , but the dis@@ figur@@ ative effect of his pres@@ idency has the power to push us all to the right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when we talk about &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normal@@ isation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Tru@@ mp , we refer to the cre@@ ep@@ y possibility that one day his babies will no longer be thrown out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is , however , an even more frigh@@ tening long @-@ term scenario in which Tru@@ mp rep@@ ublic@@ ans &quot; norm@@ alize &quot; the right wing , which suddenly appear as the ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness in comparison to its standards .
today , I find myself falling off from an active no@@ stal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s funny version of the crazy - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew what his tax return looked like ) - both in comparison to Tru@@ mp were indeed a very mild criminal offen@@ se .
if Tru@@ mp goes , the next candidate of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans must only be spiritually healthy in order to qualify as an im@@ meas@@ urable improvement .
when my cous@@ in was in the city , we brought our children to the car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the biggest of the car@@ ou@@ sels in the New York Parks department , and the best three dollars that can be spent in the city if you don &apos;t need any caffeine .
the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are cra@@ ck@@ ling and the animals rotate in order to look full of fear about their own shoulders .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of tall buildings become old , the sky@@ lines become familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not completely over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss cottage in fact - the topic @-@ pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not one of the biggest roundabout in the north of London .
the Central Park car@@ ous@@ el is still an odd magic experience , as two @-@ year @-@ old , an 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women can go on it in the 40 @-@ s and have all a great time .
if I could have evaluated the car@@ ous@@ el , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one asked him .
on the other hand , I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card .
in the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same plus the option to pay the valuation with a 15 % tip - this to buy something over the counter .
this not only slow@@ s down what should be a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required .
the poor woman in the department store stood ap@@ olog@@ ising while I was tired of the experience of submitting my credit card with five stars .
Oscar @-@ Pist@@ ori@@ us transferred to the hospital with chest pain
for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital visit .
last year he was hospit@@ alized for the treatment of cuts on his w@@ ri@@ sts , according to him , according to a case in his cell .
on account of murder , Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to a first death sentence after an appeal lod@@ ged by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning of Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day 2013 by firing her several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his home in Pre@@ t@@ oria .
Pist@@ ori@@ us asser@@ ted that he held his girlfriend for a night@@ time intru@@ der who hid himself in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors announced their intention to appeal this time against the six @-@ year prison sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , of which they say it is too len@@ i@@ ent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the National Criminal Inves@@ tig@@ ative Authority pronounced that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the objection could be heard this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us is at risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
when farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
as the last of the schools in Blum@@ berg , the quar@@ ter@@ ers from F@@ ock and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were dischar@@ ged into the holidays and in the secondary schools .
three of the students will go to high school , four to the secondary school .
on Tuesday evening , school director An@@ geli@@ ka S@@ itte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen .
the 29 students of the four classes headed by Sophi@@ a Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der chose a young eag@@ les growing up in the chicken farm , but then released into freedom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the m@@ lower band introduced a musical with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Eagle in the chicken farm &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmer Arnold found a strange egg and let it hat@@ ch from his chi@@ ckens .
instead of a hen @-@ knot@@ ting , a small eagle came out .
but the hope of making a chicken out of him fell , and the eagle was spreading his wings on a high mountain .
after that the classes showed three and four in the study of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken dance .
the h@@ ens d@@ anced with the young go@@ ck@@ ons who wore cylinders to make the bet .
the Eagle stands for integration , said Schul@@ leiter An@@ geli@@ ka S@@ itte .
the kit@@ ten is different from the other k@@ itt@@ ens ( chi@@ cks ) , but belongs to it .
but he will never be like a chicken .
his destiny is to be free .
she wished all four @-@ four@@ ths that he felt accepted in his new school .
this was followed by thanks to the colleagues , former head of school Michael Müller , who always jumps back to instruc@@ tional subjects , and the parent representatives .
the D@@ ump@@ kin period is now over , declared class teacher Sophi@@ a Schumacher .
she was leaving her students only very reluc@@ t@@ antly after two years because it had been a really great time .
after all , she was able to rely on the four @-@ door hat@@ ers .
finally , all students left a song of summer time and holiday time .
there was great joy in the children .
eight first pupils are already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians were imprisoned for illegal camps in Greece , sharing the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , c@@ iting from television .
in the morning of August 1 , a group of illegal immigrants was arrested in Si@@ th@@ onia , including the two Bulg@@ arians .
on the same day , they were released , while an investigation is underway .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were released later .
the Greek authorities have tigh@@ tened control of the free camp and place everyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose , considerable fin@@ es .
controls are continued throughout the season .
the ministry said that the court can impose a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what those affected must now know
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do Diesel drivers need to participate in the action ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
at the diesel peak , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group have offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars .
they should improve the emission characteristics of cars of the E@@ TS 5 and some Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are excluded .
Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in from the ACE Auto Club Europe gives assessments :
is the new action mandatory ?
no , the software updates are voluntary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the obligatory updates only apply to vehicles that have che@@ ating software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the re@@ armament has ordered the Federal Aviation Office ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
the manufacturers announced a spe@@ edy implementation in the coming months , but also called no exact date .
Daimler advised to write to any affected person .
if an inspection is due anyway , this will be done in its framework .
how long will the conver@@ sions be drawn up altogether ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ an@@ in .
this depends on the commitment of the manufacturers as well as from political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for we have seen , voluntarily the car manufacturers do not act on the subject of the environment up to now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should the update take ?
the conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming it could be to get an appointment .
what do drivers do not drive cars from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group ?
the ACE tells you to wait .
presumably foreign manufacturers would follow , so S@@ met@@ an@@ in .
is there a massive price decline of Euro 4 cars now ?
the ACE is afraid of that .
but even in the regions where the b@@ ans are threatening .
so far there is no loss of value for older diesel in rural areas .
the ACE encourages to wait for a sale .
ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
the first prize @-@ giving ceremony under President Tru@@ mp promises to be political .
one of the winners doesn &apos;t want to come - out of protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) gets the first ra@@ pper one of the cov@@ eted awards of the renowned Kennedy Center .
singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the choreograph@@ er Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) became the honored .
the awards will be handed over at the beginning of December .
traditionally , US President Donald Tru@@ mp will hold a reception and together with his wife Mel@@ ania will participate in the award ceremony .
the winner of Le@@ ar , which has been announced with progressive TV series , has already announced that it will not be possible to participate in the gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this pres@@ idency has decided to completely negl@@ ect the arts and human rights - even to depri@@ ve them of the means - and that stra@@ ined me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an emphasized that she will use Tru@@ mp to clarify her point of view .
the Kennedy Center named after former president John F. Kennedy is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital .
previous award winners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing .
we make the city worth living
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ la@@ chs Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , goes to retirement next year .
the place is already written out - but suitable candidates are rare .
W@@ acker has been a city engineer for 31 years .
and the work still makes him great fun as he communic@@ ates in the press conference .
he reports on varied , but demanding tasks waiting for his successor .
at the same time , it is surprising that no application has yet fulfilled the requirements profile .
the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the next possible time .
in compliance with regular periods of notice , there should still be enough time for a revision .
since Has@@ lach is acting as a lower civil authority for the management community , the applicant has to present relevant certificates .
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
if they would not be able to fill them out again , the citizens would have to travel to Off@@ enburg for advice .
but citizen &apos;s proximity is important to the city and itself , says W@@ acker , who reports about a good working climate and good atmosphere between the authorities and citizens .
in more than 30 years in ministry , some important projects have accumulated , looking back on the W@@ acker with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city worth living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is confident about the construction office and its employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : the transformation of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen@@ park@@ platz are about to be initiated .
the Kin@@ zig bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , also the stadium restoration is still subject .
the latter alone will beat about 1.5 million euros , &quot; if we do it right , &quot; W@@ acker estimates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , great tasks await my successor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
in terms of design , there is great le@@ e@@ way for a city master builder .
with Has@@ la@@ ch &apos;s own yard and hor@@ tic@@ ultur@@ ist you can react very flexibly to many things .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces is often praised by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the old@@ town as an ensemble stands under monument protection , it is important to &quot; have an eye for what fits into it &quot; when new buildings are approved , the out@@ going city master emphasizes .
anyway , the Stadt@@ bau@@ mer has a high level of responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is a builder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end everything goes over my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he can count on long@@ standing employees in the event of supervision and coordination : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been on board for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) has been working for 15 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also , that his successor will remain long , W@@ acker wishes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good company climate but also for the further design of the city .
according to information from the town of Has@@ lach , anyone who wants to be able to study Roland W@@ acker should have a completed degree as a graduate engineer or Bachelor &apos;s degree in architecture and have good expertise in the areas of construction and planning law .
the Stadt@@ bau@@ amt undergo high and civil engineering , construction gui@@ deline planning , scale renovation , management of municipal property , municipal enterprise yard with building yard and urban gar@@ dener , as well as the Lower Building Law Office including monument protection .
bicycle to the leader@@ board : closed on the south road
according to the police , the previously unknown perpetr@@ ators had thrown the blue bicycle from the rail@@ road crossing in the area of the Le@@ af@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) onto the wires .
these were so badly damaged that the freight train approaching had to be stopped .
investig@@ ators go out of two male offen@@ ders and have been searching for them since the night hours .
near the scene of the crime there were witnessed a ro@@ dless Roll@@ er- and a bike @-@ rider .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a year of Laus@@ itz@@ ring , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said E@@ BB @-@ spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch on the AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpetr@@ ators or the perpetr@@ ators would have put themselves into great danger , and also endangered railway traffic .
in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the installation , as well as the delay time and the cost of rail transport , the railway customers could also get to the offen@@ ders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; considerable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum goes out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damage was repaired on Friday afternoon , the rail traffic on the south railway line could be led without any obstruc@@ tions .
nearly ten passenger trains dropped off Friday morning , two of them covered distance traffic .
freight trains did not fall out , but they had no delay .
according to Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch some 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate may help to allevi@@ ate IB@@ D ( inflammation of the bow@@ el )
red meat and chocolate may sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
but a new study says exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients suffering from inflammatory bow@@ el diseases .
the incur@@ able condition affecting around 1.3 million in the United States and 300@@ ,000 in the United States causes stomach cr@@ amping and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ rent or bloody diarr@@ ho@@ ea , loss of weight and extreme ti@@ redness .
while those affected are normally advised to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms , researchers found at the Washington University that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant intest@@ ine .
the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells in the gut are pat@@ rolling in order to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in the food are not penet@@ rating into the body .
cells capable of tri@@ g@@ gering inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging any sensitive tissue .
if the equilibrium is too far towards inflammation , it can result in an inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
experiments have shown that a type of tolerance @-@ promoting immune cell is found in mice carrying a certain bacter@@ ium in their intest@@ ines .
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have a connection between a species of bacteria - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice had in their food , the more they had of these immune cells . &quot;
it suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and a diet rich in tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han promotes toler@@ ant , less inflammatory bow@@ el mi@@ lie@@ us , if the same system is also involved in humans .
the post @-@ doctoral candidate Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan was investigating a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found out that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same clan , but who was separate , did not .
it assumed that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , which normally live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract .
the mice of the mice were DNA sequ@@ enced and six bacterial species found in mice with the immune cells were found , but without them missing in mice .
mice were raised in a sterile environment so that an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome was missing and they did not develop this type of immune cells , and they received L. reu@@ ter@@ i and immune cells .
in order to understand how the bacteria propag@@ ate to the immune system , researchers L. reu@@ ter@@ i were able to grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of liquids - without the bacteria - to im@@ mature immune cells isolated from mice .
the immune cells developed to the tolerance @-@ promoting cells .
when the active component was puri@@ fied from the liquid , it proved to be a by @-@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism , which is known as an in@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid .
if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the feed of the mice , the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han levels were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan declared that people have the same toler@@ ant cells as mice and that most of us protect L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our gastro@@ intestinal tract .
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote , as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can lead to an expansion of this population . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has committed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
at Manchester United , N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic wrote a &quot; genius , &quot; Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid @-@ field player on Wednesday evening had his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria .
the 40 million Po@@ und signature from Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pr@@ el@@ ude game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup against Real Madrid starts Tuesday , and impressed in the pen role when people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira mar@@ ched at will .
M@@ atic , however , had been excluded from the pro@@ visi@@ oning Asia tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes , giving M@@ our@@ in@@ ho to improve before the premi@@ er of the premi@@ er league season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will help him sooner than later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lin@@ del of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u also started in Avi@@ va Stadium , when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho formed his start @-@ up for the start of the season .
the Independent stated this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho still had three further commitments , but insist@@ ed that the club had already done a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfill three of its four priority commitments .
&quot; three of four to get , for that I thank the association , &quot; he added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four , but they have made great effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pilots flew from Seattle in Washington State Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in US state Mich@@ ig@@ an and moved in the form of a Dream@@ liner over the US , which is several thousand kilometers .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
the radar screen was the form of a Dream@@ liner .
the whole was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had previously made such advertising .
thus the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing @-@ logo were painted in the sky .
new heart@@ beat for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as the wind turns : as Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still SPD boss , S &amp; D prime ministers always looked after elections with a certain concern for Berlin .
nothing but a bon@@ fire from the party central , but no head@@ wind from the Bund - thus lau@@ ded the most important desire of the elec@@ tive fighters .
since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has changed fundamentally .
since then , the employees of Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus have observed with increasing horror the events in the provincial capitals of the SPD .
what Schulz has gotten from there since the beginning of the year would not be described in the approach with head@@ wind .
there were cr@@ ates .
and one by one .
after the surprising conclusion of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against coalition of the SPD and the Gre@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this once more shows : red @-@ green can simply not go@@ vern reliably , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber to the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the surprising fraction of a Gre@@ ens MP has pl@@ ung@@ ed the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .
five months before the Sunday election , his red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ voice majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green Party executive Michael Kell@@ ner called on the back@@ sliding down @-@ to @-@ Saxon Green Party El@@ ke T@@ westen to give back their mandate .
the transition to the CD@@ U means a clear distortion of the voters &apos; welcome .
&quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ ke T@@ westen must immediately give back its mandate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Federal President and election leader of the Green Party of Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must not be true at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an SPD election fighter si@@ ghs when the new Hi@@ ban message reaches the party centre on Friday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l , the SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , is there after the emergence of the green de@@ pu@@ ties of El@@ ke T@@ westen there to the CD@@ U without his own ruling majority .
it is the provisional cul@@ mination of a whole series of big and small crises in the SPD national feder@@ ations .
and no one knows what comes next .
the Mis@@ ère began with the un@@ expect@@ edly clear defeat at the Saarland election in March .
a blue eye , more did not , cal@@ med up the comrades at that time .
according to the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia everything will be different .
then it became - and everything became much worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to the tum@@ ble , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te ble@@ w the party smoothly .
the comrades advanced lab@@ ori@@ ously in the weeks afterwards .
then , when they had just sli@@ pped new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit was headed by Hamburg .
and with him came the next grav@@ ure .
mayor Olaf Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD deputy , lost his Nim@@ bus on that weekend because he was in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city was burning .
and because in crisis communication he did so pretty much wrong with what to do wrong .
since then , Sch@@ olz fought for his political survival .
now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
because of the VW Pass@@ enger and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has been critic@@ ised for quite some time .
the mi@@ ese survey values were added .
nonetheless , or perhaps because of that , Wei@@ l tried to set accents in the Bund over the past few weeks .
the efforts of the former mayor of Hanover , to expand his power in Berlin , did not hide his comrades in the environment of Martin Schulz .
they let him be granted , because they promised to stabili@@ se the party from Wei@@ l .
now the exact opposite could happen .
in doing so , Wei@@ l is not responsible for the party @-@ internal co@@ er@@ ci@@ on of the Lower Saxony Green Party .
and Schulz is not at all .
for the time being , comrades try to keep their own ranks closed .
their anger is directed against the Gre@@ ens , and here above all on the back@@ sliding parliam@@ ent@@ arian T@@ westen there .
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic , as Ms. T@@ westen combined their own career interests above the interests of everyone else , &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , head of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) .
Ms. T@@ westen there was not elected as a direct candidate for her person , but on the country list of the Lower Saxony Green Party , so the Lower Saxon parliament continued .
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , acc@@ uses an &quot; un@@ democratic manoeu@@ vre . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the voters four years ago was clear : the people have made Stephan Wei@@ l as Prime Minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as top candidate to the Bundestag election , the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the personal career of a future CD@@ U MEPs fal@@ si@@ fies the election result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he asked to clarify the background .
I want to know if there have been more or there has been further commitments from the CD@@ U Niedersachsen .
funding Pro@@ cu@@ rement for local centre III
who wants to rehabil@@ itate his house in the years can soon get support from the country .
in addition , Mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives of St@@ eg city development were informed on Wednesday .
at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ in@@ dler gave a review of what happened so far .
since 1991 , there have been re@@ development areas in sensi@@ tivities .
at that time , in the re@@ development area I from 1991 to 2004 , the Land of Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding amount .
in the re@@ development area II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still 60 percent .
for Sch@@ in@@ dler , the existing renov@@ ations are a &quot; success project &quot; - it is ultimately important to promote interior development , and not only to open up new areas of construction .
on April 4 , the government pres@@ i@@ dium of Karlsruhe obtained the information that there will be a remedi@@ ation zone III .
the funding amount amounts to 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 euros , of which 500@@ ,000 euros from the country , the rest of the community felt .
how does a san@@ itation area come about ?
one will , as Sch@@ in@@ dler continue to investigate , where the &quot; really old &quot; homes are .
however , it also plays a role as to whether in the planned area there is any interest in rehabil@@ itating .
if necessary , the boundaries could then shift again .
on Wednesday evening , the bridge was represented by Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Keller presented the contents of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social Town &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; federal state programme , in which the renov@@ ations would be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the core of the program is the rev@@ ital@@ isation of inner cities , improving housing and working conditions , and maintaining and expanding infrastructure .
the measures would be carried out obj@@ ectively , that is per plot .
the re@@ development area would then finally be defined as a set of rules .
the eligi@@ bility period for the funds has been running since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
until September this year , however , the survey would only take place once again , in the framework of which the participants of the rehabilitation project got a questionnaire to fill out .
in November or December , the order intake should be carried out as soon as possible , so that the refur@@ bish@@ ment can begin next year .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann subsequently explained that every Commune had to carry out the aforementioned preliminary examinations .
it is about evaluating and deciding when it is to be remedi@@ ed and to what extent .
for the respective property there is also an improvement in the land register .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come even after sensi@@ bilities and make himself a picture of the situation , she promised .
Got@@ zel emphas@@ ised that the project was a key success factor for the project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , there will be questionn@@ aires sent to citizens in the coming weeks and be filled in until the end of the summer holidays . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; building and property sheet &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which it works , among other things , about the structural condition and the renovation prospects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the gray questionnaire , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hou@@ se@@ - and H@@ ousing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; information about size , distribution and residents of a residential space can be made . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; arc &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is only to be filled if business premises are run in the building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it must be noted that Got@@ zel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding .
moreover , new building measures are not eligible .
Sch@@ in@@ dler continued to emphas@@ ise that the distribution of funding according to the &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; - whoever comes first , first ad@@ mon@@ ishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one could not reserve funding for later &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; finally photos from the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Center kern II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were shown to make the present a refur@@ bish@@ ment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
British invent@@ or sets himself a micro@@ chip to get into house and car with a hand movement
a British invent@@ or is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his front door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement .
Steven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , a consult@@ ative an@@ aes@@ th@@ esi@@ ologist at the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to make sure that the implant procedure is performed according to medical standards .
the technology resembles a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and takes only 30 seconds .
Mr. Nor@@ th@@ am also wants to change the locks on houses and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip , all for an additional cost of £ 300 per lock .
the married father of one has now built in both at home and with his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which starts when his hand is at the helm .
the cost costs of the White House cost the tax@@ pay@@ ers thousands
the White House &apos;s decision to fly a marine helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month costs tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the military &apos;s information left to the TI@@ ME Magazine , up to $ 24@@ ,000 .
the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the cent@@ re@@ piece of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programmes .
President Donald Tru@@ mp , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries .
the helicopter , which was made in Connec@@ tic@@ ut , was displayed next to a yacht from Ma@@ ine , a fire@@ man from Wis@@ cons@@ in and a forkli@@ ft from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
the White House Military Office required the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary arrangement or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the records of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with a high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event to his supervis@@ or , the deputy naval commander for aviation .
the news showed that the helicopter arrived at the South La@@ wn on July 17 at 3 o &apos;clock in the morning and so long remained until the lawn had been vac@@ ated between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on that evening .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed , due to the limitation of the service hours a second crew would be required for the return flight .
the original flight crew was during the event with the helicopter while the security personnel of the unit stayed on the ground during the time on the plane .
the records provided by the TI@@ ME did not reveal whether a second flight was ultimately required .
the H@@ atch Act for@@ bi@@ ds federal states to use state property for political purposes .
records indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 has asked if the event could viol@@ ate the destination .
&quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; the commander wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it sounds like you are locked up , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; answered the deputy commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the event &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but even official events have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the president gave an impetus for reform of health reform which was in progress in the Senate and he propag@@ ated the efforts to cur@@ b government regulations .
the use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One is hardly a new phenomenon .
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for the journey .
but to demand their use only for a photo surgery is unusual .
Tru@@ mp conducted an investigation in February when the presidential jet appeared in front of the background of his first campaign rally in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of news that compl@@ ained about the use of the presidential jet by its predecessor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House is inspired by the show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 states , produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the deputy secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws often carry out training flights in the Washington and South La@@ wn areas to set the US President in the White House with precise centimet@@ ers .
when Tru@@ mp was on the G@@ 20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 conducted 58 exercise land@@ ings in the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event counted at the training needs of flight crew for the month , said an official . &quot; &quot; &quot;
helicop@@ ters also flew 11 hours on that day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions . &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pay@@ ers did not take the load for any of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man for Si@@ kor@@ sky said that the company had not been involved in putting the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not have budget desig@@ nations for presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to the U.S. Department of Defense for the 2017 fiscal year , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per flight .
records of the unit list the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers based on estimates for reimbur@@ sement rates is most mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual funds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a RA@@ ND study in 2015 , the reimbur@@ sement rates for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but take into account the cost of fuel , maintenance and conclusion of the contract .
at that time , the former spokes@@ man of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of helicop@@ ters for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present things this week , which are produced in America , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ tic@@ ut are very proud to contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds if not even thousands of people are dependent on it .
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is of course appropriate to highlight that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it wasn &apos;t clear whether Tru@@ mp was inter@@ acting with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire bri@@ g@@ ade car .
in the White House , Tru@@ mp appointed representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and sh@@ one with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the president , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have three of it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss a tri@@ cky task
leader of the second tennis league will compete in the third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
the TC Blue @-@ White Ne@@ uss will be appearing tomorrow at 11 a.m. in Kiel at the third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
despite five games of still flaw@@ less balance , the leader of the second tennis league made the sense of reality .
team Princip@@ al Mari@@ us Z@@ ay certainly has respect for the opponent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team that always plays in quite a similar formation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially at the rear positions I find the team very good . &quot;
imports from the high north mainly provide class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
&quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even point to interventions in the Davis Cup .
and they are also strong in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay with a view to Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören und Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas B@@ jer@@ ry ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be difficult for us as usual . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you also need a good portion of luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser team for the trip to the high North stands practically .
his debut for blue @-@ white could be Maxim@@ e Jan@@ vier .

how America can harm O@@ MV
Donald Tru@@ mp didn &apos;t really feel happy when he put his signature under the law on Wednesday evening to tigh@@ ten the sanctions against Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his ha@@ ste to en@@ act the law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Congress a few un@@ constitutional provisions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels hur@@ led against U.S. advance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , the draft looks forward to punish European companies that will help the Russians build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then investors have been disturbed by the local O@@ MV , which co @-@ financed the construction of the Russian Ost@@ ro@@ Spirit North Stream 2 together with other European companies .
the dr@@ one is enormous .
however , it is too early for an estim@@ ation of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil company .
in fact Donald Tru@@ mp would have to resur@@ rec@@ t the sanctions as an executive order .
twelve weapons are at their disposal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has seen what the Group could rep@@ el and which could really hurt him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nar@@ cos Staff@@ el 3 Tra@@ iler : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar , the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is moved into the center of the Hit@@ tite series from Net@@ fli@@ x
despite the second season of Nar@@ co , the Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar K@@ iller , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x is not over yet .
the three and four seasons were already confirmed by the streaming service , the first got their first trailer and showed the latest vil@@ la@@ ins of the show .
with the third season , the DE@@ A has focused its attention on the rich@@ est organization of drug traffi@@ cking in the world : the Kart@@ ell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; led by four powerful god@@ parents , they operate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like Fort@@ une 500 companies &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only with more national bri@@ ber@@ y and violent actions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Al@@ c@@ azar ) is the leader of the cart@@ el , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , P@@ ach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) commands the Mexican connection , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is located in New York .

role Back@@ wards : the City introduces 46 kitchen aids
the city organis@@ es the K@@ ita @-@ lunch itself again .
with fixed contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team .
in the municipal day@@ care centers , the clock is turned back .
on 1 September the city of Kre@@ feld takes over the food supply in the municipal children &apos;s day@@ care facilities ( Kit@@ as ) again in self @-@ control .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ ance , deputy head of youth aid , this is good news : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were all very pleased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cooking will continue to be out of the house : a cat@@ erer under@@ takes this task and delivers freshly cooked refriger@@ ated .
the city runs 46 kinder@@ gar@@ tens in the Kre@@ feld region , in 44 the children get a hot meal at lunch@@ time .
in the past kit@@ eline year 2,@@ 800 children sat at the tables , and the need is growing steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , not only children who are cared for 45 week@@ days in the K@@ ita are eating lunch , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pom@@ mer@@ ía explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour care when children stay until 2 pm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 full @-@ time professionals from 1 September kitchen service : they warm up the delivered food , supplement them with salad , raw vegetables and fruit , por@@ tioning the meal individually , give away food , clean , rin@@ se and clean the kitchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; employees are permanently assigned to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ita &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ ance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the size - there are two groups as well as seven units - decide on the ho@@ ur@@ ly scale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the kitchen assistants now belong to the K@@ ita team , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ ance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much more involved and it is easier for the itali@@ zation to implement ped@@ ago@@ gical concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s why it &apos;s all about eating heal@@ th@@ ily and cooking classes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the children should help prepare food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen force to the team is reasonable .
also for the children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have a known force in the K@@ ita , a person familiar to them and not constantly changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
cleaning up the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - up to now also the task of the kitchen staff - will be done by special cleaning personnel in the future .
this variation - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - besides the quality improvement of the kitchen performance , has also the charm that it has issued in the cost comparison between own @-@ control and foreign lending for the city as the most economic one , it is called the Press Office .
and that , although 46 part @-@ time forces are re @-@ set .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours are not so much in weight with around 750 people in the education sector , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afgh@@ an democracy depends on the political role of women , says UN
elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the head of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ ek , MD Director of Mission of the United Nations , said that hundreds of women will be candidates in the provinces . three women are candidates for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
elections can only be really representative and credi@@ ble if women participate fully and be included in all parts of the election process .
elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections take place on April 5 .
the Taliban issued threats against a choice process , which coinci@@ ded with the transition from international combat operations to an advisory role .
this year the elections for the first time will hand over the power peac@@ efully from a democr@@ atically elected government to the next .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , a strong role for women will intensi@@ fy the democratic success of Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Afgh@@ an Independent El@@ ection Commission reports that 1.2 million women from a total registered 3.6 million voters are registered .

men try to ro@@ b 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl
two young men aged 19 and 23 are supposed to have tried on Thursday to depri@@ ve a 13 @-@ year old girl .
according to the police , the men of the 13 @-@ year @-@ old talked to friends at the Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ straße at 2 : 55 p.m. , because they wanted to phone the girl &apos;s mobile phone .
but the 13 @-@ year @-@ old refused the request and went on with her friends .
then one of the perpetr@@ ators tried to attack the mobile phone and the girl &apos;s necklace , which however failed .
without prey , the duo fled .
the two young men could later be arrested by the police .
the investigations run .
G@@ MB concern about investment in Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glasgow
a union would like to make certain commitments to the long @-@ term commitment to production at its Glasgow factory in Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s managers .
G@@ MB Scotland said that the company was silent about the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross site .
more than 500 employees work in the factory , which , in addition to other products , produces hob@@ no@@ bs and rich tea bis@@ cuits .
in recent years Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ di said he has invested more than 5 million pounds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that employees and trade union representatives would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experience first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a letter to the company manager of the company , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s insist@@ ed on &quot; expressing concerns that funding for the modernization of production lines would not be pushed forward . &quot;
G@@ MB Senior Manager Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy said : &quot; the fact that we can &apos;t win clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross affects our members deeply .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; generations of families have worked here and the labour forces concentrated heavily on the local community and the Greater Manchester region , an important pillar for decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
hence , under the perspective of jobs , wages and prosperity , and against the backdrop of the Bre@@ x@@ it , the increasing cost of living and the chronic decline of production , the eastern end of Glasgow is urgently a flour@@ ishing production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ woman from Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Fili@@ al manager at T@@ oll@@ cross yesterday received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will react directly to this because we appreciate the ongoing commitment to employees and trade union representatives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross where some questions were openly discussed .
we discussed with the employees that we , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and in@@ secure economic climate , are constantly checking our business - and that applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years , we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross site , particularly in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we recognise the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production site . if our operations change at the location , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
PS@@ G Barcelona warned against N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?
the page of La Liga may regret its interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not fail in their persecution by N@@ ey@@ mar after giving an offer of £ 18@@ 9 million to release his release clause , but did they warn Barcelona three years before the record of the world record ?
the sensational base has heated the transfer window in the summer , as the League 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United for 89 million pounds in the last season .
after finishing , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest @-@ paid professional ath@@ lete in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500@@ ,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way outside , although there is a source close to the Catal@@ ans Executive Board that the club has always given its best to take care of him since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 .
but was the football world warned about this prospect three years ago by the PS@@ G president ?
when Manchester City in 2014 was interested in signing Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a severe warning for each club , who wanted to sign one of PS@@ G &apos;s best players .
&quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players , we &apos;ll face them in opposition , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi .
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to sign one of our players , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , whereby the Spanish society expressed interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer .
PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to travel in any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar .
sco@@ oter tos@@ sed and damaged
in the night of Friday on Saturday , an unknown killer has deliberately turned down a sco@@ oter in the Königs@@ feld street in front of the property number 30 and thus caused damage to the vehicle &apos;s disgu@@ ise of more than 200 euros .
the police Sch@@ ram@@ berg , phone 07@@ 4@@ 22 / 27 01 @-@ 0 , ask for notes .
police witnesses are searching for an accident on the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese .
because he met a car in his lane , the driver of a VW Tour@@ an had to do@@ dge and tou@@ red the lead .
on Thursday evening , the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ L@@ occ@@ um was driving on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au in the direction of Le@@ ese on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au .
in the area of the b@@ ypass of Stol@@ zen@@ au , a car met him in his lane so that he had to turn right .
the Tour@@ an driver tou@@ red the lead plane .
at the passenger car , material damage was created .
the driver of the forthcoming passenger car , a Mercedes Benz , over@@ took a truck and continued his journey without wor@@ rying about the traffic accident .
according to the accident victims , it can be good that the Merc@@ ed@@ es@@ driver did not notice the accident at all .

interview : &quot; Spar@@ row Spar@@ rows &quot; reports pop@@ e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Report on the ab@@ uses is reli@@ eved by Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
that means author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen takes care of discussions .
Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokes@@ man for the reform movement , &quot; We are a church , &quot; after publication in comparison with the German press agency , he acquired an ap@@ ology from the former bishop of Regensburg and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller , as well as by the cathedral cap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of Pope Bene@@ dict XVI .
it would be very useful to the pres@@ tige of the Catholic Church if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret about their own om@@ is@@ sions or their false app@@ rais@@ al of the processes at that time .
the Vatican &apos;s newspaper &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano , &quot; on the other hand , critic@@ ised that in reporting on violence against the cathedral @-@ cats , &quot; double standards &quot; would be measured .
regarding the attacks in Regensburg , no one doub@@ ted that it was &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful deeds &quot; that would have been punished and prevented in the future ; however , the &quot; degree of media manipulation &quot; was striking , as the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the National Italian Bio@@ ethics committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of the everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep that for normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn and Tax@@ is said in an interview with Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are happy to go to the church and this is a dev@@ our@@ ing fres@@ her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she also pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pun@@ ches have been a very normal educational tool , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be done with che@@ ek@@ y children , as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is unfair to apply today &apos;s standards to previous decades , as the world has changed .
in connection with the reports on abuse of abuse , pop@@ e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared .
completely wrong , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who wrote to R@@ atz@@ inger the &quot; My brother of the pop@@ e &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take care of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly is written in the 440 @-@ page report that the lawyer Ulrich Weber submitted by the dioc@@ ese Regensburg to the En@@ ligh@@ tenment ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s , 5@@ 47 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; became victims of attacks , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ atzen sexually ab@@ used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the final report it is said to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in summary , it can be stated that in many cases Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister has used forms of physical and psychological violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially with high emotion@@ ality , the pun@@ ish@@ ings for the pupils could also be more intense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast to numerous other defend@@ ants , however , many victims have appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases even have positive memories with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen ( Bad R@@ atz@@ inger ) is reli@@ eved .
Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; In@@ ci@@ dents of Viol@@ ence of Viol@@ ence at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , &quot; is a contradic@@ tory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
on the one hand , many students emphas@@ ise his &quot; humanity . &quot;
on the other hand , he also appears as a chol@@ eric and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , which became tangible to the public if a cathedral spar@@ row didn &apos;t bring top performance musi@@ cally .
how do you evaluate this final report as a bi@@ ograph@@ er ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger appears at all in it .
there are eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly acqu@@ itted of any suspici@@ on of complic@@ ity or co @-@ knowledge in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the exc@@ esses of violence at the pre @-@ school were also outside his sphere of influence .
you can , at best , be accused of having experienced it too late or not having taken initial indications seriously enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um , on which he worked , was perceived as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rede@@ mption &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; better world &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger give a very excellent testimony , describing him as &quot; warm @-@ hear@@ ted , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; as extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher who regularly provided the boys with cakes , bis@@ cuits and sweets and &quot; always surrounded by grapes of children . &quot;
only a minority is compl@@ aining about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and his high emotion@@ ality , which has also led to floo@@ d@@ folds .
the fact that he was not only cra@@ cking with chairs and throwing the key@@ ring on the ground , but also distributed ear cow@@ ards and over@@ looked all too nau@@ gh@@ ty boys on the hair or ears , he himself admitted years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it .
to his salvation , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the time , the 1960s and 1970s , at both parents and teachers .
do you also know such breeding methods ?
of course , I think every one of us who was born before 1968 .
I also experienced this in a secular school , a state gymn@@ asi@@ um .
compared to what actually happened in this report , namely the terrible sexual abuse and the violent exc@@ esses at the pre @-@ school , these are certainly bag@@ at@@ ellen .
one wonders if it doesn &apos;t have to do with his fame and his role as a brother of Bene@@ dict XVI , that many media have just fallen on him .
in the Bavarian pop@@ e many who have never understood him are still working di@@ lig@@ ently .
but the truth is that the report is reli@@ eved by Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
in the media , in connection with the report , there was much talk about the issue of abuse at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger committed in the final report any involvement or co @-@ knowledge with regard to sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : quite clearly no .
not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted themselves to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were initiated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have never dar@@ ed to talk about it with my father or mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one affected representative for the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing for me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real problem with the education of sexual abuse was , however , that most victims are silent .
if they didn &apos;t even trust parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then definitely not a ch@@ oral leader , who would have been a colleague of the perpetr@@ ators professionally .
how do the Spar@@ kl@@ inger pupils judge R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role with regard to the mis@@ use cases ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ able student expressed it this way : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... not a case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) had had timely insights and could have stopped the respective perpetr@@ ator .
I think it ... also for really absurd to assume that ... Bu@@ ilt are more insist@@ ent , or more clearly or more open than their parents , dormit@@ ory leaders , trust teachers , etc .
that you talk to him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that students and / or their surroundings were familiar with it could not be confirmed in the context of the study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as for sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus acqu@@ itted of any co @-@ knowledge .
it cannot be accused of preventing or displaying it .
therefore there is no reason to associate your good name with these vile crimes , as unfortunately happened in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the media , much of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violent exc@@ esses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was to be read among the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former dom@@ ici@@ le master Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looking away &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he have to live with this reproach ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : it &apos;s the big problem that everything is mixed and mixed up in the coverage of a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and violent exc@@ esses and somewhere in the middle , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but this is precisely the mis@@ use of the report .
there is a clean separation between the pre @-@ school and the gymn@@ asi@@ um of the cathedral @-@ cats , between sexual abuse and violent exc@@ esses as well as , we say , other alleg@@ ations .
in addition , the report covers incidents of the period since 1945 , thus also from four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not choir director of the cathedral @-@ cats .
all the horrible test ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases in which children of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were pun@@ ched and portra@@ yed and suffered terri@@ bly , all took place at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions have prevailed .
but with them , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger didn &apos;t have anything to do , because he only got to face the boys when they were already on the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on this , as most witnesses stress , the theme &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pres@@ ch@@ ool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tab@@ oo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was only happy to escape and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heavenly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what was different on the Cathedral Physi@@ cal gymn@@ asi@@ um ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : although there was discipline , there was no sa@@ di@@ stic violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report concludes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many victims appreciate the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases even have positive memories with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this way , at most , the accus@@ ation remains to be looked away .
but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre @-@ school .
the first time in 1970 @-@ 71 , when he had just begun to establish himself , and of his predec@@ essors at a school where he was not working and responsible ( so the witness ) didn &apos;t want to hear anything , and then again around 1993 .
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently start the ears before the states ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Cathedral Physi@@ cal gymn@@ asi@@ um , which the report even re@@ produces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this he points out that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in the pre @-@ school the punishment will continue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even in the face of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent action .
that was , of course , at a time when legal clarity had long been forbidden in Bavaria as a criminal off@@ ence .
before that , they took place in a legal grey area , as everyone of us knows .
it was also difficult for him to assess where the victims were perhaps exagger@@ ated or dram@@ ati@@ zed and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded .
but you can &apos;t say that he always looked away .
this is just not true .
only in 1980 the re@@ pris@@ ings of schools were officially aboli@@ shed in Bavaria .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn and Tax@@ is claimed that it was unfair to apply today &apos;s ped@@ ago@@ gical standards to time .
how do you see it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we are talking about the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fall@@ out of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; that is , the danger of evaluating the past according to today &apos;s moral standards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the princess is right .
but this , of course , does not apply to sexual abuse , which at all times was h@@ ein@@ ous and also not for what was broken in the pre @-@ school of ad@@ vers@@ ity and violence on innocent children &apos;s souls , that goes far beyond what was done at that time .
that &apos;s all aw@@ ful and I &apos;m glad that it will finally work .
but at the same time I have to take shelter from Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because all this had nothing to do with him .
its means of discipline and punishment , so to draw ear @-@ hol@@ dings and hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .
when physical pun@@ ish@@ ments were then banned , it adher@@ ed strictly to it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what picture of his time in Regensburg has played Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the talks with you for the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of the pop@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
did the subject of Prü@@ m punishment come into speech ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , that is , Pope Bene@@ dict XVI . , from his perspective , the cathedral @-@ cats only played a secondary role .
nevertheless , I did not at all mean that he led a strict regi@@ ment there .
but even this must be said once : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without the demand of unconditional discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world tran@@ ce , true cultural ambass@@ adors of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with bis@@ cuits and cand@@ y only one does not make any big singers and before every success , no matter what area , but always discipline , passion and overcoming @-@ overcoming .
what kind of people have you experienced by Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during the talks on their book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : through work on the book and beyond , I have met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really well and again and again experienced as wonderful , humor@@ ous , basic , deeply believing and heart @-@ good people , one cannot imagine that he could do just a fly .
I get regular contact with , how many former cathedral @-@ cats still today , 23 years after his en@@ ery , regularly contact him , visit him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of their family .
those who have not forgiven him until today , that he once was strictly speaking to them , are thus clearly in the minority .
most of the cathedral @-@ cats are grateful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music .
and that he is always a good fa@@ ther@@ ly teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also a lovely respect person , to which they still look up today and who are down@@ right dish@@ on@@ our@@ ing them .
and please , again quite clearly : everything you submit to it is educational methods that were on the order of the day .
we can be happy that we have long over@@ came this time .
but it is most unfair to make a man just because he is prominent and has a more prominent brother to become a medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
there is the evil intent behind it , too obvious .
for the report , which was just published , reli@@ eves him .
now the insur@@ rec@@ tion@@ ist would command a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who had acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bavaria , and perhaps Germany , nobody would know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally in peace .
