<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four cards that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irren-Anstalt, where young people should meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A crypt chapel, where it is now dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Farmers cultivate the former cause of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories on days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It's annoying when maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everybody knows that, who had to get upset, because the car-navigation system showed a green meadow instead of a bypass road.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historic maps of the Bavarian Bavaria-Atlases, an offer of the Geoportal Bavaria of the state government, are anything but current - but it is very enlightening.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities in the spread-area of Munich's Mercury have changed since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern-Atlas is a patchwork that is not recognized as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">The large overview map has been incorporated into more detailed maps for cities and municipalities, so-called documents.</seg>
<seg id="13">These were created according to the Bayerische Vermessungsverwaltung between 1810 and 1864 and originates from the first surveying in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your principal: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French military commander occupied Bavaria since the spring 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even if French troops finally deported with the peace of Lunéville on 9 February 1801: it was the present neighbours who created the idea of an area-wide Bavaria map.</seg>
<seg id="18">Elector Max IV Joseph drove the project forward, founded the "Topographische Bureau" - and thus the Bayerische surveying administration.</seg>
<seg id="19">The position sheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and is to be found like all others on the website of the Bavarian State Library.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison Early / Today is most impressive in the example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">One example is subsendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was born 21 years after the creation of the map, that is, in 1877, as the Munich district.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, Untersendling is located in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along the today's Plinganserstraße, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the revolt of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today the Westpark is, one sees nothing but fields - at first sight: in zooming a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears: handwritten numbered plots of the so-called "primordial" from which the base tax was derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "small plots there are no longer occupied by farmers, but farmers of the plant" "" "land in the sun" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">Theresienwiese, the venue of the Oktoberfest since 1810, was in fact a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete jungle.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "in the area of the present district Au-Haidhausen one reads not only the street name" "" "at Gasteig" "" "or from the height" Auf der Lüften "" "" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt" "" "in the area of today's Au-Haidhausen area." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße, one once locked people with delusions.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "in 1858 / 59 the Munich-Kreis-Irrenanstalt" "" "Auf der Auer Lüften" "" "was created." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872, Dr. Bernhard of Gudden headed the institution - the psychiatrist, who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "he was advanced for his time and finished for example the ankering of so-called Irren." ""</seg>
<seg id="36">Moreover, he forbids the personnel to use force against the occupants, "says Hermann William, head of the Museum Haidhausen who has engaged in an exhibition with the institution.</seg>
<seg id="37">Initially there was room for 280 patients, later expanded to 500 places.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the rotary mill in hair 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">Isar-Amper-Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="40">Young people meet in the area of the former Auer Anstalt in the Munich-based Salesianum.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with training facilities.</seg>
<seg id="42">West is the football field of TSV München Ost, east of residential buildings from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "in 2015, the children's house" "" "Casa Don Bosco" "" "was built in an architectural resemblance to the original building of the Irrenia, which had been destroyed during the Second World War by bombing raids." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "the Marienplatz was listed as" "" "Main Square" "" "in 1856, the Kaufinger Street was called" "" "Kaufinger Gasse" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War brought a decisive change also in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The Allied bombings broke many holes in the city centre in December 1944.</seg>
<seg id="47">A large one remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business houses and a chapel from the Middle Ages, once stood at the Marienhof, where these days work and on April 5, 2017 the groundbreaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn commuter route takes place.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider you can compare the old Munich-map with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Ombudsman publishes Travel Warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the Advancement of Farms has issued a warning for coloured people who are travelling to Missouri because of discriminatory policies and racist attacks on the state.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAPACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which is to enter into force by 28 August 2017, calls for special attention to afro-American travelers, visitors and Missourians, as a series of questionable, race-based incidents seem to occur throughout the state and be noted here," says the Group.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently adopted law of Missouri, which makes it harder for people to win discrimination, as well as the law enforcement authorities who disproportionately target minorities, prompted the group to issue travel warnings, said the NAPACP.</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "they have violations of civil rights that happen to people." ""</seg>
<seg id="55">They are halted because of their skin colour, they will be beaten or killed, "said the President of Missouri NAPACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "we hear discomfort in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group cited allegations such as racist relocation against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died in dubious circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no more gasoline during the trip and was taken into custody by the Missouri police without blaming a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also points to a recent report of the Missouri General Attorney General, which shows that black motorists in the state are 75 percent more common than whites.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," "" "said Chapel." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "people need to be willing to take advantage of it or let the relatives know that they travel through the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the hate crime report programme of the FBI, which classifies the state as regards the number of such injuries to the 16th place of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">"" "" "" "travel warnings are also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to accuse a company on account of housing or employment discrimination." ""</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, after the states had adopted immigration laws that would bind local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for immigration infringements.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but lately interest groups have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">Fence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fischbacher Weidezvn project is a successful project and will continue next year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Members of Parliament Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac have obtained a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">Representatives of the Fisherbach CDU local association together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies met with the rectomenhof of the Schwendemann family.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann granted first insight into his farm in which he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 milk cows and as many young kittens and houses in five apartments Feriengaeste.</seg>
<seg id="72">"" "the" "" "Black Forest" "" "is the alternative marketing path for him for the milk of his cows," "" "Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="73">Only Regionales are at the table of the Feriengaeste.</seg>
<seg id="74">Since he is also BLHV Chairman of Fischerbach, he called the fence project as "essential."</seg>
<seg id="75">I cannot manage on such steep faces.</seg>
<seg id="76">The grassland area is prepared for a lot of work, and much has to be handled with the brushcutter.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "we have to fight with the conditions and topography here," "" "said Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003, he took over the parental operation and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertiliser, even if he does not carry out a bio-operation.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "for mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear that" "" "the Commune has recognised the importance of the fence project and is glad about the leadership development." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">At the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">It is hoped that the reforestation of the surfaces could be pulled out for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the biggest treasure we have is the people working in agriculture and thinking about how they continue their operation," "" "the mayor stressed." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often criticised because of funding</seg>
<seg id="84">A total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013 via the fence construction.</seg>
<seg id="85">The area of disclosure amounts to 40 hectares which may not be explored until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Half of the total costs in the amount of 71 500 euros were promoted by leader, a quarter carried the municipality of Fischerbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">The farmers thus remained 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of electric fence.</seg>
<seg id="88">"" "" "" "the big advantage is the durability of the fences," "" "said Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "Kordula Kovac stressed:" "" "you are doing a really good job without farmers and landwives." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "Peter Weiss has also stood firm:" "" "the best food is produced here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landschaftspflege Directive (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows state funding of pasture-fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is to keep the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The prerequisite is the presence of a subsidy specified by the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">In addition, the enclosed area should not be poor (slope inclination above 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by the afforestation.</seg>
<seg id="95">For the Fischerbacher willow fence project 2018, the application of eight participants with 24 parcels, which would like to build nearly 16 kilometres fence, is currently underway.</seg>
<seg id="96">The accounting area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112,000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump sees the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">Americans like these as well as any other - therefore the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Firos Square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump Regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated argument with Jim Acosta from CNN on the president's proposals to drastically restrict legal migration to the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To stay fair, Miller was not attacking the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and liberty-imitators would have smoothed him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he reached its significance, and in particular the importance attributed to it, when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the monument was completed, was added to its base.</seg>
<seg id="105">When Miller bought Acosta, "I don't want to go down here for a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">"" "the poem you refer to, which was later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is factually correct, but as he formulated it, it is not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporaneous response to the vibrating words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your weary, your poor, / your oppressed masses, who yearn to breathe freely, the miserable rubbish of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">"" "there was never a time when the" "" "elemental waste" "" "on our screens was better to see." ""</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the meaning of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural conflict: it is indeed a conflict about the meaning of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who started to place her words on the basis after her death - knew very well that she had completed a highly political story.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture was to show the connections between French and American republicanism by portraying the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classic portrayal.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a quite different name: mother of exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The combination of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on the American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus was changing the meaning of the statue, the people of the right wing wanted to change it for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great cry of Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anyone but rather an early Neoconservative to bring the American flame to the world's umnachted world: "Lady Liberty is going on.</seg>
<seg id="119">It should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">"" "the torch should not enlighten the way to the United States." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="121">Rather unusual is Limbaugh here something startled.</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is quite a question of the standpoint of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative deed of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted, eleventh, but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the deck of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And that is, of course, not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to recognize.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch should not enlighten the way, but ignite the hatred that is their only source of power.</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championship 2017: Neil Black praised Scottish members of the UK Team</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots were part of the team of Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="130">"" "the performance director of the United Kingdom's athletics track, Neil Black, says that the 16 member contingent of the world championship leader will make a massive contribution to the team." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="137">And also with the type at the corner of the road.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Buttier- competing against Sir Mo Farah on the 5000 m track, while Eilidh Doyle was chosen by the team captain.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "" "" "Eilidh is rather modest." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "her captain's speech was incredible," "" "said Black." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.</seg>
<seg id="143">"" "the passion and the real feeling that Eilidh brought in quite naturally were great." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="144">The Commonwealth Silver medal winner, which will compete at its fifth world championships at the 400 m hurdles, says it is "incredible" that 16 Scots are in the British squad.</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total of athletes at the World Championship has been seven, which have been reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The middle distance runner Muir carries on this road and last year has set five British and two European records.</seg>
<seg id="147">It will take part at the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs.</seg>
<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman to watch for a great season, which included the victory in the British Team Trials and Anniversary Games.</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle appeals to her first World Championships when the only other Scotsman in Team Lee McConnell was.</seg>
<seg id="150">The team captain says that they are "enormously proud" about the fact that many of their compatriots do not only belong to the team, but in some cases also be involved with medals and the finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">"being special about team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honor anyway, but knowing that my teammate colleagues voted for me and chose me, makes it something very special for me," she added.</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously I am very proud of all the Scots that belong to the team.</seg>
<seg id="153">It shows only how far we have come.</seg>
<seg id="154">And they are here as well-established athletes, athletes, who want to climb to Podium.</seg>
<seg id="155">What about my speech as captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think she went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home championships.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to rely on this kind of home support and benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion.</seg>

<seg id="160">Blocking Critics on Facebook: do not concern yourself with a public office if you cannot tolerate the heals of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington but it didn't take long until the newspapers hit him because of everything, from domestic politics to his political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He knocked at the critique, sure.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not silence his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "for in 1783, Washington said:" "" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and mute, we are led like sheep to slaughter." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hog's employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their views on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union was therefore accused of it at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The Governor's staff dismissed the complaint as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a counter-reaction with "Na, and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"" "" "" "it's just Facebook," "" "said many people." ""</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is particularly important if it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governor in an overpowering democratic state that is amazingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest consent of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his State and strict adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skilful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and to end his hairy head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore the blocking of persons coming to the Governor's side - which is a public forum that is designated as official and of employees paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the acts of the governor and argued that blocking the commentary was nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people swinging online the whip.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post talked to some of the real people that were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are only genuine people speaking with their chosen leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, no trolls.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not professional.</seg>
<seg id="184">The pastor recited the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked for hate crimes.</seg>
<seg id="186">"" "" "" "I commented courteously that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other news," "" "she wrote in the commentary area of the news broadcast" "" "The Post." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="187">"" "" "" "I don't really appreciate this idea when a number of people take a stand on the same theme, then they are ignored by some rather than a so-called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "what the staff of the governor described as" "" "concentrated spam-attack" "" "would probably call" "" "intercession" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in previous times when you have done the same that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical articles or to arrest and silence demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="191">But that's exactly what happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official to criticise Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is accused of Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this issue was last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County finally injured the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a voter from her Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky Gouverneur Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit to the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">It should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time of Washington, the time of the affordable car had a similar effect as the internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letters smashed to his leadership.</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then, Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">The people who used pseudonyms such as "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius" and "Poretius," wrote letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions.</seg>
<seg id="202">Petitions, which criticized his position on the contract of Amity, trade and shipping with Britain, overwhelmed his ministry, according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of George Washington Project.</seg>

<seg id="440">One day after being accused of 15 states, Scott Pruitt, head of the Environmental Protection Authority, withdrew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era in order to reduce emissions of smoke-causing pollutants.</seg>
<seg id="441">Pruitt presented the change when his agency proved to meet the needs of the state environmental authorities more responsive to previous administrations.</seg>

<seg id="466">750 years of St. Hilarius Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the Bergkirche, the old cemetery area in Tumbes will be invited to a serenade on Sunday, July 16 at 16.30.</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historical St. Hilarius plant is a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">Visitors to the sixth Benefiz serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and sponsors of tumours to their concerns.</seg>
<seg id="470">"" "Walter Martini emphasizes:" "" "it is a unique village jewel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267 the St. Hilarion chapel was first mentioned in records in the Wuerttemberg Documentation book: Graf Hermann von Sulz sold the mountain with the parish church of Tumfingen and the Vogtland "at Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">According to the wording of the document, on the Tumour hill, except for the former parish church, there was also a noble court belonging to which the church or the patron was right and not vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were also people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">As from the description of the Freudenstadt Oberamt, dating back to 1858, it was next to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still visible today in the townscape of tumors, the "mountain" of the third, the noble settlement nucleus of the village.</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps of the period around the year 1600 all confirm these historical facts.</seg>
<seg id="476">The right of patronage arose from the early medieval church law.</seg>
<seg id="477">A master who built a church and occupied with a pastor remained the owner of this church and could also bequeathed this church.</seg>
<seg id="478">Associated with this was the right to appoint a pastor or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The Greatest of the two were destroyed in 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly created bell sounded for the first time in 1692, but had to be handed over later during the Second World War in 1942.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648) the windows were hammered and the bells were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaky.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796, French troops camped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">Remains of the church threatened in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869 the tumlinger Hilarius cemetery was also used as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was expanded and the Hilarion church was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the church tower could be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="490">During the New Year's Eve 1834 a storm broke the bell tower and half collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="491">In order to prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the tower-tower still existing today was preserved as a witness of the 750-year-old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">Today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem maintain the Hilarius plant as the successor of Dieter Dockhorn.</seg>
<seg id="494">The organisers invite the friends and sponsors of Tumours on Sunday, July 16, for the sixth serenade at the old cemetery for St. Hilarion chapel.</seg>
<seg id="495">It is designed by the Combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with words by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.</seg>

<seg id="509">Within this concentration zone construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes the exclusion of wind power utilization for the rest of the city.</seg>

<seg id="522">With the construction of the four wind turbines, the electricity needs of some 11 400 households will be met - equivalent to roughly one-fifth of the electricity needs of all four-legged households.</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW re wants to invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">Last summer, Viersens town council gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines in the Linnich wind park near Aachen, as well as a participation in a wind turbine in Übach-Palenberg in the Kreis Heinsberg.</seg>

<seg id="540">The municipal administration and commercial association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.</seg>
<seg id="541">The Gewerbeverein and the city thus enter a further stage of the project "Attractive inner city."</seg>

<seg id="684">Quantity: usually in Steinfurt in the furniture exchange, once a week I help out in Greven in the furniture bridge.</seg>
<seg id="685">And I worked at the school already in the open full day.</seg>
<seg id="686">What are your experiences with it?</seg>
<seg id="687">Quantity: it's a beautiful, wide spectrum that I see here.</seg>
<seg id="688">I have to do with different people, with youths, with refugees, with young adults.</seg>
<seg id="689">They are now 26 years, so a late-called volunteer.</seg>
<seg id="690">How does that come about?</seg>
<seg id="691">Quantity: I made A-Levels.</seg>
<seg id="692">And then a civil engineer studies, let's say, successfully aborted.</seg>
<seg id="693">I realized for myself that it is wrong for me and I want to do something different with people.</seg>
<seg id="694">And then I asked myself what you do.</seg>
<seg id="695">Do a social year, there's an insight, there you can see how it is on the spot, at the focal point maybe also, really.</seg>
<seg id="696">And was it that way?</seg>
<seg id="697">Lot: I have collected great impressions.</seg>
<seg id="698">In the winter semester, I will start my studies in social engineering.</seg>

<seg id="702">It always depends where you do your FSJ.</seg>
<seg id="703">You can do it from the retirement home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work.</seg>
<seg id="704">With me it was very varied.</seg>

<seg id="759">The proposal envisages that the investor signalizes that in this respect it is not possible to throw a billet between legs, to determine that both the semitrailer and the structure of the environment - which reduces the height and makes the construction more economical - would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="760">Needless to say, not only Wilfried Sohmer thinks, is this addition.</seg>

<seg id="904">The work on the three bridges on the highway 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is proceeding well.</seg>

<seg id="908">The building is scheduled for October and Leicht is sure that the schedule will be respected.</seg>
<seg id="909">The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads across the Trombach.</seg>
<seg id="910">It is an arch bridge made of concrete, covered with red Buntsandstein and has a total length of 4.80 meters.</seg>
<seg id="911">It was built in 1900.</seg>
<seg id="912">Like the other two bridges, it has now come into the years.</seg>
<seg id="913">To ensure stability and road safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly restructured.</seg>
<seg id="914">The other two bridges lead over the Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="915">They are made of red Buntsandstein.</seg>
<seg id="916">Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, respectively 10,60 metres long.</seg>
<seg id="917">The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach has now received a 1.30 metre wide and seven tons weighted bridge cap on Wednesday morning on the north side.</seg>
<seg id="918">This is a marginal fixing, which is also used as operating path.</seg>
<seg id="919">On the southern part of the bridge, a bridge cap of 2.20 metres wide is to be used on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="920">Then the pedestrian walkway is to run.</seg>
<seg id="921">The special thing is that these are finished parts, a patent of the Schramberger company Dizwo.</seg>
<seg id="922">The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps.</seg>
<seg id="923">A special feeling of tact has required the laying of cables through the building in Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="924">Because there is also a fibre-optic cable, to which many companies are connected.</seg>
<seg id="925">The residents were informed about the project in advance of the work.</seg>
<seg id="926">In addition, fish and crayfish had to be fished off first.</seg>

<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unimpeded issues of European football clubs will not disturb Neymars world record transfer from Barcelona to the Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Any consequences will come to Paris Saint-Germain of the UEFA, as the guiding organisation that oversees the European game has the power to forbid teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Financial Fair Play rules, launched in 2011 by the UEFA, mean that PSG will eventually prove that the transfer from Neymar has been financed without major losses.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to extract the Brazilian from its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary which will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars move to France.</seg>

<seg id="1128">Publishers are allowed to spend a lot of money on the purchase of players, but must deal with legitimate sources of revenue that allow them to break even point in their soccer-related business.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA President in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that clubs, who had taken enormous debts in their quest for success, effectively cheated and risked to ruin themselves when banks or proprietors withdrew their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011, FFP shifted from concentrating on the debts of clubs to monitor their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model, originally used by Roman Abramovich in Chelsea in 2003, bought a club with potential and then invested strongly to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder matter.</seg>
<seg id="1133">During the current three-year FFP expiration period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of EUR 30 million.</seg>
<seg id="1134">And although Platini has fallen from the presidency in 2015, his successor, Aleksander Ceferin, continues to be deterred by excessive expenses.</seg>

<seg id="1138">The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has hit the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, owned by Manchester City, with the toughest sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">The PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (at that time 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players.</seg>
<seg id="1140">The UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outsmart their financial view by raising their revenue from companies associated with the owners of clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a catarian business could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsoring should exceed the standard market rates, UEFA would not be considered legitimate revenues.</seg>
<seg id="1142">This was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the PSA sponsorship of the Qatar Tourism Authority has been sewn up.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that part of the PSG Payments to Neymar could come about payments from the Organization Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But by 2022, PSG and Qatar have argued that Neymar won the World Cup and that such maneuver could be easily detected for the UEFA regulatory authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1145">The previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be more attentive to respecting each attempt to circumvent the rules.</seg>
<seg id="1146">The UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymar's transfer, on Thursday the people familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1147">They spoke of the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press as they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>

<seg id="1198">Now, "Comrade Detective" on Amazon commemorates another kind of nostalgia: to revive the Cold War by "The Americans," to the film "Atomic Blonde" and even to "GLOW" with its east-west wrestling iconography.</seg>

<seg id="1317">Living the big life: mezzanine and clever design tricks have turned this small Earls Court home into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, reduced himself from a big house in Knightsbridge to Earls Court apartment in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that I lived in a much larger room with my ex in Knightsbridge," says Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"" "" "" "I looked for something comparable to my price." ""</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and she had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"" "I fell in love with her and made an offer this day." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot has been completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne storage space and an mezzanine to make use of the spacious ceiling height optimally.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.</seg>
<seg id="1327">That was my request, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose, she instructed the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed of Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 foot high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms over each other, so that the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate level in which one could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively to solve the task.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"" "" "" "the steel works are quite complicated," "" "he explains." ""</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "we had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked on top of each other without having to bend us." ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">"" "it wasn't just about building a simple platform, but to create the steel so that it had the right height for the function at the top or bottom." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms at full height above each other - with a lot of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine, a classic copper glazing window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">At both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to make it work longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen, the mirror feels like a window into another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all the seating and glasses of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">Through the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Collapsible kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"" "" "" "a bit of engineering art went inside," "" "explains Erfan from the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door." ""</seg>
<seg id="1345">"" "" "" "it is very important, so when you push the door forward, it glides very easily." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to gain an additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"" "" "" "at the end of the day, you will sell the land - or how your property is appreciated," "" "says Erfan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1348">"" "" "" "in a rudimentary form a real estate agent will enter and a calculation based on the size of the floor will be carried out." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they have managed to enlarge the floor area and at the same time use high-quality materials giving the room its luxurious benefit.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"" "" "" "the materials are the things that you touch and help create an emotional bond in a home," "" "says Erfan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "" "" "you do not love the electrical sockets in the walls." ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">These are important, but they do not play with your heart. "</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that a flat can be transformed by a good design and increased square footage of some standard into something completely amazing.</seg>
<seg id="1354">In fact, like Joanne, you could decide to not leave it.</seg>
<seg id="1355">Brothers fight for a $500 million real estate empire</seg>
<seg id="1356">Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty in a debate because of one of Victorias's biggest real estate agents worth over $500 million.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The former director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors from his younger brother Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1358">Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014, but a sharp debate on separation takes place in the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Together with her mother Anna, the brothers have accumulated 38 real estate worth more than half a billion dollars, since the family purchased a business in Smith Street, Collingwood since 1973.</seg>
<seg id="1360">The Westco jeans company founded jeans there and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores.</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1362">This money has been invested in real estate, and De Lutis's portfolio now includes offices in the city center, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt. Buller as well as shopping centres in the suburbs.</seg>
<seg id="1363">Following an agreement with her deceased father, Colin - by Paul as "the main operator and the dominant personality" is described in the De Lutis family - about two-thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one third.</seg>
<seg id="1364">A court record states that this means that Colin owns property worth $316 million and Paul valued at a value of 176 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"" "" "" "the divisions proposed by Colin have left him with what I thought for the best objects," "" "he wrote in 2015 in a first affidavit." ""</seg>
<seg id="1367">Last Friday, after several failed negotiations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice took place.</seg>
<seg id="1368">The brothers now also struggle for control of the existing business - of which Colin, like Paul asserts, has excluded him.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Colin argues that this is not true, but suggests Paul to incompetently manage some possessions.</seg>
<seg id="1370">In an early Affidavit that was filed by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="1371">"" "" "" "my Italian inheritance dictates that the family is the most important priority," "" "he wrote." ""</seg>
<seg id="1372">The costs rise in the event, with hundreds of pages with Affidavits, emails and reports from companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, among them Allan Myers, QC, and from both parties held law firms.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Ms. De Lutis and her deceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delicatessen stores from the late 1950s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="1374">They used the security to buy the collingwood property in which Colin opened the family's first jeans shop.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Colin says that he began Westco there when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old)."</seg>
<seg id="1376">Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass on their property to their sons benevolently.</seg>
<seg id="1377">"" "" "" "Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court," "" "she wrote." ""</seg>
<seg id="1378">Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies, with Colin claimed that Mark had paid $10 million while leaving the company and Luke 26 million.</seg>
<seg id="1379">"" "both Luke and Mark are," "" "Paul says," "" "has become bitter about the conditions of their financial separation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1380">Colin held back very well, although he was a former AFL member of the AFL and after a biography of the year 2015 by Eddie McGuire the best friend of television stars.</seg>
<seg id="1381">Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1382">"" "only Colin answered by SMS to say" "" "I can really not say much," "" "because the case is before the courts." ""</seg>

<seg id="1388">Trumps new Chief of Staff plans to limit the president's media abstinence.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Politico reports that the White House's new Chief of Staff plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more consistent track.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the White House's new Chief of Staff, met with leading employees on his first day of work, he posed a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House, which he wanted to repair: bad information that was thrown into the president's hands.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told the staff that information should flow through him - whether on paper or in mailings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame trucks by monitoring his media diet.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumps relationship to television ranges back decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"" "" "" "if candidate Trump was angry for unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting of jobs that were to convince," "" "said former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg against Politico in February." ""</seg>
<seg id="1399">"" "Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote in the time that" "" "the key to keep Trumps Twitter custom under control, according to six former electoral campaigns, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1400">Alright.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps Twitter custom ever was "under control" is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Maybe these campaign officials know something we don't know, that Trumps tweets wouldn't have contained even more combustible materials without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about tweets that Trump didn't broadcast.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his co-workers manage to keep him away from him a few times, then their efforts paid off.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently forestalled that Trump causes controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">Part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, always try to put forward their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may promote their views of the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Politico - focused entirely on this story - reported in May on the predilection of the advisers to provide doubtful information to the president for strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldsmith:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"" "" "" "current and former Trump officials say that Trump can respond to negative press cuts, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he is able to figure out where they come from." ""</seg>
<seg id="1410">This was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone was malicious in writing a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh, "being the source behind a pile of leaks" in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for chicanes or that he offered no concrete evidence, or that he has expressed false allegations in the past and has revoked it.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and started asking staff about Walsh. "</seg>
<seg id="1413">"" "gold-makers added that the former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and General Secretary of the White House, Rob Porter," "" "tried to implement a system in order to manage and document the paperwork that Trump receives." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did it work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove himself as an effective manager as Priebus, but Trump still is his impulsive self, and his advisors are still striving for influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">These immutable factors make Kellys Mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1449">In the fall of 2014, in view of the dramatic rising numbers of refugees coming to the district, the hotel building was offered as a collective accommodation, which provided controversial discussions.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the housing of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">The decision was not undisputed at that time in the Council.</seg>
<seg id="1452">But above all, Freudenstadt's mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and at that time spoke of serious interested parties in the house.</seg>
<seg id="1453">He should keep right.</seg>

<seg id="1521">The colossus heavy and 5800 square kilometers of large colossus now drifts to the north and will probably take two or three years until it is melted.</seg>
<seg id="1522">With 175 kilometers of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers, it is one of the largest ice giants that researchers have registered in the past three decades.</seg>
<seg id="1523">There is no danger to people from him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">According to researchers, the extent to which climate change has played a role in the decline of the iceberg is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1525">In total, however, for some 30 years there has been a series of unusual breakthroughs of ice-tufts in the region, writes the US Research Center for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) in a factual background.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now broken Koloss was a part of the Larsen-C Schelhagus so far.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelfeira floats on the sea and is fed by big glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It therefore grows further into the sea and breaks regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelhagus lies south of South America almost at the head of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">North of this ice shelf the balance of waxes and breakages was disturbed several years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">A complete horseshoe is broken there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There's a lot to say that the Larsen-C-Schelhagus is in danger, as the front edge has never withdrawn as far as it is currently.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the ice sheet stands under tension and can be discarded if a piece is collapsed at a key point.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of Schelfeira and Eisberg does not increase sea level because they float on the water and ice as much water as it results in the melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase sea level, but only to a lesser degree, writes the British research project for the observation of Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">According to AWI, the Larsen-C Schelfeira is the fourth largest horseshoe of Antarctica with nearly 50 000 square kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="1539">At the transition from the mainland, it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean approximately 200 meters.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural occurrence and we have no direct connection to climate change, the ice shield now comes into a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary of the British Swansea University.</seg>
<seg id="1542">"" "" "" "this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the records," "" "he also confirmed." ""</seg>
<seg id="1543">Among scientists is controversial whether the Larsen-C-Schelhagus would now grow back or go back in the long term and possibly collide, said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added: "our models say that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even if these explorers do not decline this gigantic iceberg to climate change, many ice caves in the Antarctic Peninsula have fallen apart during the past decades.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long tip of the Antarctica extends towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to data from the British Antarctic Survey, the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The increase in temperature has contributed to the decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed around three degrees over the last 50 years and is therefore one of the areas where the temperature is fastest.</seg>
<seg id="1550">CDU wants to get home tariff at the staff</seg>
<seg id="1551">Because it becomes more and more difficult to occupy vacant places, the CDU demands to step out of the employer association to become more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="1552">It was only shortly before the summer break that the Cretaceous Group inked 41 new jobs in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1553">More than 1100 employees and officials are working for the district administration in Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Now, 17 trainees have had their first working day.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The teaching positions in the circle are obviously very sought after.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Around 620 applications were recorded for the places to be awarded this year.</seg>
<seg id="1557">However, the circle is still lacking to handle the increased demands and tasks.</seg>
<seg id="1558">At the moment there are still 50 unoccupied places in the Mettmann District.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Among other things, we are looking for doctors and engineers as well as general administration personnel.</seg>
<seg id="1560">The CDU, together with the FDP and the UWG, wants to take the initiative jointly with the FDP and the UWG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1561">According to the wishes of the parties, the administration aims to develop a concept for recruiting personnel and personnel development. "</seg>
<seg id="1562">The aim is to not only cover short-term needs for skilled workers, but to counteract the future-oriented application shortage, that is to say.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The overall concept should be oriented inside and outside, show concrete measures for beginners and include an education offensive, demand CDU, FDP and UWG.</seg>
<seg id="1564">This sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you didn't know before.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other towns advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">"" "the speech is of a real" "" "competition of the public employers" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1568">There is a high number of employees who leave the service due to illness or age.</seg>
<seg id="1569">It is time for action so that no more jobs will remain unoccupied.</seg>
<seg id="1570">But Klaus-Dieter's people, leader of the CDU, go beyond the joint request with his party.</seg>
<seg id="1571">He already caused a big surprise in the spinning day, when he openly questioned the cost coverage and baffled the rest of the parties.</seg>
<seg id="1572">"" "" "" "people want all possibilities to be reviewed which allow a withdrawal from the local employers" association. "" "</seg>

<seg id="1574">In this way, the CDU tries to pay better the employees and officials as it actually envisages the tariff for the public service.</seg>
<seg id="1575">The salaries are currently prescribed exactly, increases or more money are only available when you switch to a higher tier oriented to professional years.</seg>
<seg id="1576">But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="1577">Only a few weeks ago new premises had to be established in which employees concerned about the provisions of the new Prostitution Act.</seg>

<seg id="1579">Italy sharpens the tone to NGO migrants rescue boats</seg>
<seg id="1580">"" "" "" "Italy has warned NGOs that use lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean, warned that they are not allowed to continue this unless they comply with new rules for their operations." ""</seg>
<seg id="1581">"if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue," said interior minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.</seg>
<seg id="1582">Minnitis alert came a day after the Italian authorities had seized a boat from the German relief organisation 'Jugend retention' because their crew worked effectively with human traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="1583">The relief organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to comment on the allegations of the Italian prosecutor, Ambrogio Cartosio.</seg>
<seg id="1584">"" "" "" "we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," "" "said the organization in a statement on social media." ""</seg>
<seg id="1585">"" "" "" "we can only judge all accusations that are currently charged, after collecting all information and assessing the situation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1586">The Italian authorities had supervised the boat from 'Jugend retention', the Iuventa, since October.</seg>
<seg id="1587">It is thought that his crew takes dinghy migrants on board, delivered directly by human traffickers and that smugglers can shut down so that the ships can be used again.</seg>
<seg id="1588">At least one such meeting was reportedly staged only 1.3 miles in front of the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's acts, whose content was published by Italian media.</seg>
<seg id="1589">The occupation is suspected of taking over the authority of the Italian coastguard who oversees rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Under the Code of Conduct, boats such as Iuventa must, above all, have an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Only three of the nine NGOs who are involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to abide by the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.</seg>
<seg id="1592">"" "the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable, as they would not bring" "" "major changes or disabilities" "" "to their rescue operations." ""</seg>
<seg id="1593">Among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel laureate organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).</seg>
<seg id="1594">"" "" "" "in the meantime, Minniti said that the number of migrants who arrived after the rescue measures in Italy had declined sharply in recent weeks, which resulted in the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguard and the cooperation with local mayors." ""</seg>

<seg id="1599">Three friendly guides were available for this.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The accommodation in the Wachenheimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.</seg>
<seg id="1601">The castle and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome addition.</seg>
<seg id="1602">The first tour led to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim during hot summer temperatures along the vineyards.</seg>
<seg id="1603">There were viewpoints, partly on towers, from which one could see far above the Pfälzer Wald and the upstream plains.</seg>
<seg id="1604">In between there were always longer ascents, for the long trials rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1605">On the second day went to Bad Dürkheim to Saline and to the folk festival Wurstmarkt.</seg>
<seg id="1606">Again there was a lookout point at the lookout spot, connected by "floated" Trials and moderate ascents.</seg>
<seg id="1607">On the last two days many meters of altitude have been announced.</seg>

<seg id="1612">Console instead of lawn - Bundesliga tires for e-sport</seg>
<seg id="1613">Will the sports stars sit in front of computer consoles in the future instead of being skinny in wind and weather over the stadium racing?</seg>
<seg id="1614">Fact is: e-sport has long become a serious business, become a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gauges included.</seg>
<seg id="1615">The first Afghans have also recognized this, which are increasingly involved in this area.</seg>
<seg id="1616">The beginning of 2015 was the VfL Wolfsburg, later on the FC Schalke 04 and last of the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an e-sport department in mid-July and took up two pros for the FIFA 17 computer game.</seg>
<seg id="1617">"we hope to inspire whole new young target groups for the VfB," says CEO Jochen Röttger.</seg>
<seg id="1618">"" "he is certain that there are still some clubs on this train." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1619">Next weekend, the FIFA World Cup in London organizes the first "Interactive Club World Cup," where gamers of different clubs compete against each other.</seg>
<seg id="1620">In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or PSV Eindhoven qualify.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Also Robin Dutt sees great potential in e-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1622">The ex-coach of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen currently advises an agency for virtual football players.</seg>
<seg id="1623">"real football must be dealt with particularly with the 14 to 30-year-olds that young people still go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="1624">And: the clubs tried to conquer all sorts of markets, especially the Asian ones.</seg>
<seg id="1625">With prominent e-sportsmen under contract, one could be present online much more frequently in these markets than once a year to send the German government to Asia.</seg>
<seg id="1626">What is it all about?</seg>
<seg id="1627">In the E-sport computer games like "League Of Legends," "Dota 2," "Counterstrike" or the football-simulation FIFA are contested at competition level.</seg>
<seg id="1628">As in normal sport, they have long established leagues in which the professionals race against each other.</seg>
<seg id="1629">And in Asia's 2022 e-sport is already part of the official programme.</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it a real sport in general?</seg>
<seg id="1631">For many, the idea is certainly getting used to.</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Frobail has also been dealing with the question for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="1633">For the professor at the German Sport University in Cologne, e-sport is a sport because he is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that can be found in classical sport - for example, increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.</seg>
<seg id="1634">In addition, it needs cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding and rapid response.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Professional gamers should train their bodies not only at the console but also on their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="1636">"" "" "" "the fit player is a good player." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1637">"" "but it also sees problems:" "" "doping becomes more and more a topic." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1638">Controls were difficult to carry on when playing online, and in the scene the structures of classic sport lacked.</seg>
<seg id="1639">The scientists clearly highlight the high integrative effect of e-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1640">The players are on the international road, that's like a big global family, there are no cross-cultural barriers.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A study conducted by the Deloitte business consultancy and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth in e-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1642">In 2016, 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany, mainly via advertising, sponsoring and big tournaments.</seg>
<seg id="1643">Sales are expected to reach 130 million in three years.</seg>
<seg id="1644">This is little against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the Bundesliga.</seg>
<seg id="1645">However, "e-sport" is no longer far from other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey, "writes the Deloitte advisers.</seg>
<seg id="1646">Internationally, many countries are already on the move.</seg>

<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, expert in the CRIEPPAM agricultural research institute in Provence, said: "the lavender in Provence is effectively compromised because in recent years the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change, which in spring brought much less rain and in autumn a lot more.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has an impact on the life of lavender.</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist highlights the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The staff of the weekly newspaper Riodoce usually meet on Wednesdays to check their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the State of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and ceaseless drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">They were told that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-level journalists are discussing what is more secure: they are supposed to take their children into the office, which in 2009 were the target of an attack with grenades, or leave them home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words on a tablet at the front of the room: opponents, Neutral, Allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is needed, perceptions and gut feelings.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of standing on the salary list of the government or cartels, a catalog of criminals who make the Chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no rest from violence, and while the corpses are accumulating throughout the country, there are more and more journalists: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto resigned in December 2012. 589 are after attacks and threats under federal law and until now there have been at least seven dead in seven states this year.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter is their editor and inspirator by Riodoce, co-founder of Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist," "" "wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence is felt deep, although his presence is present everywhere - a great picture of Valdez, which shows his middle finger with the word "Justice," hangs on the facade of the Feodoce building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear t-shirts which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although a special Attorney Office was established in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists, it has initiated only two criminal proceedings, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most of the thousands of murders linked to drug trafficking and organised crime every year, journalists are rarely placed in court.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are inconsolete and although the terrain is now even more traitor.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting for discussion of security has little benefit, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "as long as we don't know why, we mistrust everyone." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of 15 May Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the provincial capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "Twelve river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumours tend to fly freely in culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the subject of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzman's arrest last year and the delivery to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country as rival factions are fighting here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa one or more people are shot on the street every day or that the cemetery full of decorated, two-storey mausoleums for drug kings, which are larger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of tranquility when only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable harbours and drug trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, broke the blame for not protecting his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First of all, in February the publication of an interview with Damascus Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel fractions in the war with Guzman's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This release may have annoyed the children, suspected gangsters also bought each copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper kiosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second mistake was to not force Valdez after seizing another newspaper that had published the same story to leave the country for its own security.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and its killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived for so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he was always there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to establish Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars in equity.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "in Sinaloa," "" "it was impossible to run journalism without encountering the drugs problem," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1847">Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for the courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved being able to publish hard-hitting research without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dared to deal with.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria Moors-Cabot Prize" for her coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the protection of journalists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drug history, wherever she led.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He volunteered to be afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"" "" "" "I want to live on," "" "he said at the time of the CPJ distinction." ""</seg>
<seg id="1853">"" "drug trafficking in Sinaloa" "" "is a way of life," "" "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV." ""</seg>

<seg id="1856">The Feodoce team misses Valdez, the spawn-bird, who could curse like a dockworker, a friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guiabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit on the same table there.</seg>
<seg id="1860">"" "now they ask," "" "Was his love of the routine be his destruction?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how they can best do their job and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"you don't like it when you deal with their women, their children, their clean stores, their sneezing runways to move drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells incorrectly, stay away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">The anger is, said the publisher of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal that "smells a sense that can be fooled... and then the thing happened to Javier."</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other countries where a toxic blend of lucrative smuggling, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape changes constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the space where the staff of Riodoce met for safety training, no cell phones suddenly were allowed. days before it became known that Spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside two policemen were looking for protection against the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a mid-range district of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the joke, some of the reporters asked themselves if these officers belong to the 50 percent of the police officers whom the governor himself called not trustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It has been months since the reporters have gone into the mountain landscape where drug gangs are de facto under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the edition of this week, Riodoce was staring on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former known Boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé to the state spending that focused on the home town of the governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group living in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the prosecutor's office, kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was kidnapped, or what happened, so be caution when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favorite local drug dealer and government.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belonged to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which almost conquered all the political levels almost the whole century.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently several PRI governors were accused of high-caliber cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this pub, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military assault.</seg>
<seg id="1883">Only a few months earlier, the readers of Valdez were considered the best informed source of the kidnapping.</seg>

<seg id="1886">The office of Valdez has been redevoted to the storage room for signs and stickers which protest against the murder of journalists, because the employees have become something they never expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and went next morning to a demonstration for another journalist for the office of the prosecutor.</seg>

<seg id="1890">Journalists have become more vocal all over the country by writing in organized protests "SOS Press" on walkways and buildings.</seg>
<seg id="1891">On that day, director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries to raise international support for the Valdez case.</seg>
<seg id="1892">During a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to spy on journalists and kill them because they told the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">Since then she has asked her to be subdivided again by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">"" "Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime, involved government officials and a valid society." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1931">He met what seemed to be out of place from the surrounding rock, and decided to take a closer look.</seg>

<seg id="1942">The astonishing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and armor over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the counter-shading, a widespread defence method in the animal kingdom, which means that the tip of the creature was darker than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the shadowing is common, the results are surprising as the size of Borealopelta by far exceeds that of today living animals.</seg>

<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also indicates that the skin of the dinosaur was bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to investigate the animal on clues about his life, including his preserved intestinal content, to find out what it had eaten as his last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, got into a river and driven out into the sea, where he sank on the back to the bottom of the sea.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At that time Alberta was as warm as South Florida today, and rivers and oceans probably farther farther inland than they are today.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"" "" "" "this dosdoser is really remarkable, because it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin but also preserves in three dimensions and preserves the original form of the animal," "" "said Brown." ""</seg>

<seg id="1955">The Cretaceous period was a time when huge thermal diodes, carnivorous dinosaurs standing on two legs crossed the earth.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the King of them, who lived Tyrannosaurus Rex, millions of years to Borealopelta, the armoured dinosaur was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">This includes the acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11,5 m) long, six tons of heavy monster.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the professional journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta sank after death in the sea and was mumiated in mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he arrived at the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum, it is the best armoured dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long tips protruding from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armored herbivores have been swept through the western Canada until a flooded river floods into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the undersea equipment of the dinosaur kept its armor in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remains of this special specimen are preserved so well that the house stallions still cover bumpy armoured plates along the dinosaur.</seg>
<seg id="1966">As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as rare as winning the Lotto.</seg>

<seg id="1974">At the Stuttgart-München (A8) motorway, about 20 people were injured during a massacre of around 20 people on Thursday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="1975">According to the police, at 5 pm there were about 30 cars between the connecting offices Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (County Aichach-Friedberg) during a thunderstorm, almost 30 vehicles, among them trucks, crashed into each other.</seg>

<seg id="1986">Deutsche Bahn: company tests "comfort check-in"</seg>
<seg id="1987">It is a moment that almost everyone has already experienced: nothing surprising is in the train and sleeps.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Or one is deepened into his work and has just a brilliant mind.</seg>
<seg id="1989">And then: buffer.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Comes the conductor and arouses an unsuspecting or tears the passenger in the middle of the workflow.</seg>
<seg id="1991">Ticket inspection.</seg>
<seg id="1992">But the times of interruptions are soon over.</seg>
<seg id="1993">The Deutsche Bahn is currently testing groundless ticket inspection.</seg>
<seg id="1994">It is simply confirmed by mobile phone that you take your seat and thus validate the ticket.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Currently, a test run runs on two routes.</seg>
<seg id="1996">"" "" "" "come the offer, we expand it." ""</seg>
<seg id="1997">"" "it will probably be available early next year on many other long-haul routes in Germany," "" "said a railway-speaker." ""</seg>
<seg id="1998">"" "" "" "comfort check-in" "" "is the name of the railroad devaluation without Schaffner." ""</seg>
<seg id="1999">To be able to use it, however, some requirements must be fulfilled: you need a smartphone or tablet.</seg>
<seg id="2000">And you have to book an online ticket - what already most passengers do.</seg>
<seg id="2001">It is also necessary to have the app of the train which DB Navigator must have bought, which anyway is the most convenient way of booking.</seg>
<seg id="2002">Last but not least you need a seat reservation.</seg>
<seg id="2003">"" "because the" "" "comfort check-in" "" "works: one gets into the train, calls his ticket to" "" "My Tickets" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2004">In the case of the test customers, then a button for the electronic devaluation will appear.</seg>
<seg id="2005">The train attendants get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat Y.</seg>
<seg id="2006">If the train attendant comes to place Y at the ticket inspector lane, he knows that there is a passenger with an already validated online ticket.</seg>
<seg id="2007">So you can go on sleeping, working on, keep silent.</seg>
<seg id="2008">The "check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn should take advantage of the passengers.</seg>
<seg id="2009">"" "" "" "who wants to travel relaxed without ticket inspection by our train attendant, simply checks in the DB Navigator himself." ""</seg>
<seg id="2010">This allows the passengers to personalize their travel time in the train, "says Michael Peterson, DB long-distance marketing board.</seg>
<seg id="2011">"" "second Plus:" "" "and our employees have more time than today to respond to the individual customer needs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2012">Those who travel often know that in addition to delays and missed trains, ticket controls are one of the biggest offences.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Because often you have, in any case, one of the co-travelers not all the documents you need to degrade online tickets.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Either the credit card or the identity card is missing or otherwise a document that must be presented.</seg>
<seg id="2015">The result is endless discussions between train attendants and passenger, which leads to bad mood in the absentee or greater space and delays in controlling their own tickets and takes the conductor to take care of other matters at the end.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.</seg>
<seg id="2017">And that applies only to ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Further train numbers on the same route are not yet unlocked.</seg>
<seg id="2019">How an activist got to learn the answer to the question: "whose Streets?"</seg>
<seg id="2020">On 9 August 2014 Brittany Ferrell was shaken to its core.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Just one day after she arrived in New York City, the apartment in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an airbnb apartment she rented and scrolled by Facebook on her telephone.</seg>
<seg id="2022">She stumbled over a mail from someone from high school.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"" "" "" "the police just killed an 18-year-old child, and it is still on the street," "" "she said there." ""</seg>
<seg id="2024">Confused, nobody else posted the information on her feed, she closed facebook and opened Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly saved on her timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The rapper from the area of St. Louis was tweeting live tweets the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo.</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted a picture of Browns's lifeless body stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"that's wild," Ferrell thought.</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new to them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She turned her mobile phone to return later in the evening to Tweets about people on the Canfield Drive.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There were photos of police bands and people crying out, and by a man who claimed to be a father's father who bore a sign with the inscription: "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="2032">She watched a live feed where a policeman was standing in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">In another video, she said, assuring another policeman being his rifle, crying, "I'm going to kill you... all of you killing animals."</seg>
<seg id="2034">"" "" "" "this is not usual," "" "Ferrell recalled her statement." ""</seg>
<seg id="2035">"" "" "" "this is not the kind of murder we have used to and which we can call typical." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2036">At that moment I felt chills.</seg>
<seg id="2037">"" "I was angry and wept." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2038">She booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After the landing at 11pm, she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened in the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the theme of a new documentary, "Whose Streets?," in cinemas from the 11th.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience that exists from the point of view of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">When Ferrell came to Ferguson with her daughter, who wore a flower dress and a suitable crown, the two had a conversation, which they had "black experience and the black state" innumerable times before this morning.</seg>
<seg id="2043">"" "" "" "you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" "" "she remembered what she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2044">"" "" "" "we are now going to Ferguson because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and that was not right." ""</seg>
<seg id="2045">"" "I couldn't take her away," "" "Ferrell said later." ""</seg>
<seg id="2046">"what happened today is a culmination of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">It must know it and see it and be drawn up in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">It must be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution, and what we have to do to free ourselves to free ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Even though I have the luck to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience blatant racism, she is no different from the next black women child.</seg>
<seg id="2050">"" "I feel I would be a bad service to keep them away from it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2051">The first station, when they arrived at Ferguson, was at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority who became a camp area when the activists waited for the possible non-prosecution of Officer Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There Ferrell and her daughter joined a local businessman who had lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new type of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism changed completely after August 9," she said and noticed that she was President of the Minority Student Nurse Association as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communes.</seg>
<seg id="2056">"" "" "" "I had no experience in organising." ""</seg>
<seg id="2057">It's all come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan during an evening demonstration, one of the co-directors of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2059">Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to "document" what happened.</seg>
<seg id="2060">One question came to Ferrell: "do you want to document or try to find a story you can take advantage of?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">This skepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often of whites - in a community which benefited from their pain and resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2062">"" "as Folayan recently stated in an interview:" "" "we had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson did not center their voices and we wanted to do it differently." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan already collaborated with the co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around death strainers.</seg>
<seg id="2064">His engagement brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other natives the team of "Whose Streets" followed in the years after Brown's shooting.</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us. we're talking," Davis said.</seg>
<seg id="2066">"" "" "" "this was the main thing for me as these people are portrayed, for this is how I shall be represented." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2067">The goal was not to concentrate on Ferris's experience - to show that the movement "is not a messiah leader, but a community that comes together," said Folayan - it proved to be the most open participant in the film.</seg>
<seg id="2068">"" "as a result, documents from" "" "Whose Streets?" "" "are surprisingly personal aspects of Ferris's life, how she falls in love and marries her wife." ""</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," Ferrell said and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2070">"" "" "" "but I understood that there must be some vulnerability in this work and in the humanization of black people." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2071">In addition, Ferrell's history repeats the role of black gay women in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founders of the movement following the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 identified the film "Blacklive Matter" in social media, identified as gay.</seg>
<seg id="2073">"" "" "" "black, gay women in leadership positions have worn the movement overall," "" "said Ferrell," "" "and we are constantly struggling on different fronts." ""</seg>
<seg id="2074">"" "black, gay women must bear the main burden of everything." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2075">"" "Folayan agreed to note that" "" "the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2076">"" "however, it insists that" "" "this is not an affirmative type of action," "" "when Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film because of her identity." ""</seg>
<seg id="2077">"" "" "" "she was the person who stirred up this energy," "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2078">"" "" "" "it is not a coincidence, although it was at the forefront because in a life at these crossings as a black, gay woman is so much at stake." ""</seg>
<seg id="2079">"" "you can sense your energy through the screen." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2080">In the meantime, the news cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared, but the racial connections between the church and the police continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on parole for 2 ½ years because of the blocking of a motorway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">It describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area they call their home: "chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">Yet she clings to a song and she feels bound to this memory, since she went on the street three years ago in Ferguson.</seg>
<seg id="2084">"" "" "" "it is our duty to fight for our freedom." ""</seg>

<seg id="2088">From "dream" to "megalomania": TV viewers discuss bit-gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves people even though they are not built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre at the southern end of the pedestrian precinct splits the population into proponents and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The theme hardly leaves one.</seg>
<seg id="2092">"" "the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page" "" "Volksfreund Bitburg" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2093">While the one to the bit gallery say, "That would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be great" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side: "don't need a person" (Siggi Betzen) or quite simply: "megalomania!" (Lars Scholz).</seg>
<seg id="2094">While the proponents build that a gallery will attract more customers into the city, from what the other stores also profit, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone bleeds.</seg>
<seg id="2095">In addition, the gallery is planned precisely on the grounds where the farmer's market hall stands, in which 13 direct marketers offer their products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">At the beginning of the construction work will be finished.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The Gallery-makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Beda square with a possibility to sit outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">"" "Simone Room:" "" "we have been shopping for many years almost a week in the farmer's market hall." ""</seg>

<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "whether direct marketing will settle in a market hall in the gallery depends on the amount of rent.</seg>

<seg id="2108">There are enough of them in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">You can see how many shops here are empty - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">But as there is not even a regular weekly market, it is all the more important that at least the market hall will be preserved.</seg>
<seg id="2111">After all, the goods offered there are fresh, is mostly offered directly by the producer and is cheap at the top.</seg>
<seg id="2112">As you can see, shop shops are rented in a shopping mall only by bigger companies, because the rents there are often not portable for a retailer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">"" "too bad, there are almost no special deals and what is left of it will probably disappear." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping mall with a market hall doesn't fit together for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">First of all: where should the farmer's market hall look like during the construction period?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run if the bit gallery actually actually comes.</seg>

<seg id="2122">But for a farmer's market hall, thanks to the insane many - as I find - senseless building projects in Bitburg have no place anymore.</seg>
<seg id="2123">When the farmer's market hall is broken down, a piece of culture will disappear again. "</seg>
<seg id="2124">A matching similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the space of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces are visible - white, black and brown, almost imperceptibly alike - hanging on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfern and Haaretz, which were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former secret service analyst served a 35-year prison term after publicly trailed diplomatic reports on WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition, which was opened on August 2, is called A Becoming resemblance.</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline agreed her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transducer and pioneering female student, whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama, when he had only three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg originated from the algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted from maning and created out of 30 portraits, as anyone could look with these genomic data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but has already spoken openly about identification as a woman since puberty, was condemned in 2013 for 20 charges, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Through the prison her image was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-white selfie, in which Manning obviously sits unwell on a driver's seat and carries a platinum-blonde wig - with which she was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg just came from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In this, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artefacts, like cigarette butt and chewing gum, extracting the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people could look like.</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," said Dewey-Hagborg at a press review of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not be photographed at that time and she could not be photographed, so they contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her imprisoned Muse have become unequal bridles, which in the course of two years interchanged several letters.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created a comic "Suppressed Image," illustrated by Shoili-Kanungo, which predicted a future in which the President would convert Chelseas judgment and would be able to see the exhibition in person.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published, Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome kind of happy meeting.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also now something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender forces to find new, tweetable ways to keep the rigid circuits that he should actually fix.</seg>
<seg id="2142">"" "when Dewey-Hagborg was asked for the strange timing of all these things, she said that" "" "things are going to happen for a particular reason." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2143">In a artistic statement written down on the wall of the gallery, Manning called for an end to the "automatic fragmentation, whose foundation was gender, race, sexuality and culture."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandler of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg waited to show by the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the highly developed scientific encyclopedia of the artist) how amazingly similar, at least in a biological way, we are all.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what hopefully will bring people with it is that our genome does not care who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work from 2007, Spurious Memories, is also to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in its own space, is a page from the above-mentioned Comic-Novelle.</seg>
<seg id="2149">She shows Manning as she emerges from the discipline of the United States like King Kong with a hands-free hands-on phone.</seg>

<seg id="2153">"" "" "" "I still get goosebumps when I talk about it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2154">Manning has not seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if it was supposed to do, then it will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks, from their own genomic simulacons, which gather like hordes of protesters.</seg>
<seg id="2155">This was also target-orientated, like everything in the exhibition, up to size (5 "2, Manning Stature), where their genetic haplogroups were written with a pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," said Dewey-Hagborg from the portraits.</seg>

<seg id="2161">The documents say Cornell-Duranleau, 26 died after several stitches.</seg>
<seg id="2162">A common warning system published by the Chicago police authority states that the corpse was discovered on 27 July.</seg>
<seg id="2163">Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries on his body.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead at the site of the action and detectives examine the stitches as murder, while the police are actively looking for the two suspects, officials said.</seg>
<seg id="2165">She has been professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.</seg>
<seg id="2166">Alan K. Cubiner, the vice-president for university relations, said in an e-mail explanation that Lathem was now in a beautyful way and had been expelled from entering the Northwestern University campus.</seg>
<seg id="2167">"" "" "" "this is now a criminal issue investigated by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University collaborates on this investigation," "" "said Wilson." ""</seg>

<seg id="2169">A speaker at the University and Somerville College said in an email explaining that "we are in contact with the UK police and are ready to help the US investigative authorities in any way possible."</seg>
<seg id="2170">The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and want him to be.</seg>
<seg id="2171">Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago police authority, Anthony Guglielmi, said he strongly insisted on the suspects to face the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="2172">"" "" "" "the police have an idea of their whereabouts, and our efforts to locate them reinforce," "" "said Guglielmi." ""</seg>
<seg id="2173">Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities help to locate the suspects.</seg>
<seg id="2174">Guglielmi said the police got a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received an enigmatic tip saying that something happened in apartment 1008.</seg>
<seg id="2175">The police described the scene as very cruel.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27.</seg>

<seg id="2180">"" "" "" "we will complete the WADA roadmap in the near future" "" "- Russian vice-president Mutko" ""</seg>
<seg id="2181">The Russian Vice President Vitaly Mutko said it won't take long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) are implemented to restore the Russian anti-doping agency (RUSADA).</seg>
<seg id="2182">"" "" "" "at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap, RUSADA has the right to plan and test in collaboration with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping)." ""</seg>
<seg id="2183">The WADA roadmap was updated in this respect, "said Mutko on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="2184">The PM commented on the second part of WADA roadmap to comply with the code, which describes the criteria for re-establishing the USAID and was recently published on the organization's website.</seg>
<seg id="2185">According to Mutko, he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia.</seg>
<seg id="2186">"" "" "" "everything was announced, everything is being implemented." ""</seg>
<seg id="2187">And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future, "he added.</seg>
<seg id="2188">However, one of the criteria mentioned in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the study approved by the WADA by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren to publicly subsidized doping in Russian sports.</seg>
<seg id="2189">"" "in terms of the matter, Mutko said:" "" "we carry out the investigation because our anti-doping system has confessed a mistake." ""</seg>
<seg id="2190">All measures have been implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2191">"" "but there were no state programmes, and we won't give something that does not exist." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2192">Mutant's words agreed with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the leader of the independent Russian anti-doping Commission.</seg>
<seg id="2193">In conversation with the Russian sales point rsport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov delivered problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but added: "we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="2194">"" "no one has to accept this report unconditionally," "" "added Smirnov." ""</seg>
<seg id="2195">In November 2015, in the course of the doping scandal, RUSADA was excluded from the carrying out of doping controls in Russia in the course of the doping scandal.</seg>
<seg id="2196">However, it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).</seg>

<seg id="2203">The start-ups that will help your company to become the next Uber</seg>
<seg id="2204">Amy Errett wanted to make your employees happy with your e-commerce start-up, but the surveys didn't work.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Answers were often vague, little helpful or - worse - deceitful.</seg>
<seg id="2206">And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.</seg>
<seg id="2207">"there was never consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care Company Madison Reed.</seg>
<seg id="2208">She summoned people from the outside for help.</seg>
<seg id="2209">A new Human Resources Start-up race is at the lookout to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">Through the creation and licensing of software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it enables companies to conduct surveys, offer special groups and demographic groups, to address employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases, Whistleblowers allow managers to bypass managers and turn directly to the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"you now have tools such as Strava and Fitbit for tracking your health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.</seg>
<seg id="2212">Errett said they got a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years won with Glint.</seg>
<seg id="2213">In addition to the Snap Surveys and Surveys of certain teams, it offers a heat card of the company, which shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which managers have low feedback results - so you can drill down, why.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Companies are coming to see that they have to remain at the head of the workplace culture so that you won't be the next Uber who has been involved in scandals since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of harassment in which those who have spoken have been punished.</seg>
<seg id="2215">For start-ups like Glint, this wish is an overview of a lucrative business opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could be worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020 according to the Let's Talk Payments website.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, start-up Convercent, the company helps to prevent bad behavior and to recognize, saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year amid the Uber-Falles in Misskredit.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The client recently signed up as a client.</seg>
<seg id="2220">As Glint, Convercent enables companies to send customized "pulse" surveys, collect sensitive answers in real time, and view the heat maps of your problem areas.</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also provides an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2222">And when the chief executive officer is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"the court of public opinion has captured the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent.</seg>
<seg id="2224">When a company is found that deals badly with its employees or behaves unethically, it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycott, employee fluctuation and complaints, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of politics and procedures and have a simple way to reach their headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Earlier, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a telephone number or email for the company headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby TUESDAYS General Counsel who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now, as the company Convercent uses, problems that have previously been hidden by leaders sitting in offices in cities or states have been identified and addressed - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair interns.</seg>
<seg id="2229">"" "" "" "I can approach this holistic, 360-degree view into the experience with employment," "" "said Vitrano, who heads the Risk Management Group of Ruby Tuesday." ""</seg>
<seg id="2230">"" "" "" "and we protect our shareholders from employment disputes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2231">Companies began to take Ethics, Values and Employees' Commitment in 2002, after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed because of ethical breaches by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="2232">"" "but it took until the" "" "social media came to their right" "" "that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry going online." ""</seg>
<seg id="2233">"" "" "" "before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2234">Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service, and charge the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance to find the approval of Venture Capital investors who have supported both start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">Convercent received $10 million in funding in February of firms like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the total capital to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Glitzers secured $10 million in November by Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing total funding to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">These investments are hardly surprising given the connected nature of businesses, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees are expecting more from their jobs than before.</seg>
<seg id="2240">In competitive markets like Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only missions.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"when people are happy to be in a company that's worth their voices, and that the work that you do is worth doing," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.</seg>
<seg id="2243">Investors gain yields when their portfolio companies run well. companies run well when employees are committed and committed.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data about employee engagement in accordance with the experts in the workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data are useless if the administrators of a company do not take action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">In fact, when a company asks employees for your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the change does not come fast enough, or not at all, it can grow disappointments and demotivate employees.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"if you ask for 4000 comments, you need to be ready to have 4,000 talks," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management firm of Kotter International, who has seen companies that have too much rely on collecting data.</seg>
<seg id="2250">"" "" "" "for if you will not follow employee, ask yourself," "" "Have you really heard me?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2251">Do you care about it?</seg>
<seg id="2252">And if you don't care about it, why should I? "</seg>
<seg id="2253">Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly employee surveys, was able to initiate measures on the same day, when a problem is reported about Glint, saving.</seg>
<seg id="2254">And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, it was able to reorganize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">At Ruby Tuesday, the company gets new insights into employees and hopes that in the long run, this leads to a better bonding of employees in an industry known for high turnover.</seg>
<seg id="2256">"if you are not obligated to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," said Vitrano.</seg>
<seg id="2257">"and if you lose people, you also lose customers.</seg>
<seg id="2258">And if you lose customers, then you will lose your business.</seg>

<seg id="2260">It starts at 11 p.m. when a lot of UCLA football players talk to the campus on one side of the new practice areas of the team.</seg>
<seg id="2261">Some have pulled out their tricot upper parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp.</seg>
<seg id="2262">For a good part of the team, these idle minutes are a lunch break.</seg>

<seg id="2264">"" "" "" "this is a real treadmill for the guys the next three days," "" "said Bruck-Trainer Jim Mora just before the Monday became a Tuesday." ""</seg>
<seg id="2265">The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease the load of the players, and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="2266">Therefore, the first three UCLA training sessions should start at 7: 15 p.m. to meet the already fully packed schedule of the players.</seg>
<seg id="2267">The compromise away from the two days is more than a day in which the Bruins postponed the start of the camp almost one week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Moras performed six seasons in Westwood practical exercises.</seg>
<seg id="2268">20 before beginning of formal preparations for their prelude to Texas A & M in September.</seg>

<seg id="2284">The company told in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to detect potential false messages and to send them to fake messages that may display results of the fact examination from the original article.</seg>

<seg id="2290">Creating a comic novel: a castle in the history of England</seg>
<seg id="2291">In his recent past, the little Scotney Castle was to be seen in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970-s and 1980's.</seg>
<seg id="2292">But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy sitting in the Cloudy River Valley in Kent and now has become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a cosmopolitan Yorkshireman with a fondness for historical documents.</seg>
<seg id="2293">"" "" "" "I find it so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2294">"what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand."</seg>
<seg id="2295">'A Castle in England 'covers the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scotney. each story has been illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.</seg>
<seg id="2296">It is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive: he wrote 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories' in 2014, a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpectedly emotional.</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I only responded to the thumb print on the side of a letter, written by a double agent in the 1700" s who worked for the Jacobins, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="2298">"" "" "" "this is his thumb print!" ""</seg>
<seg id="2299">And letters always smell of smoke, because at that time they lit a fire because of the light.</seg>
<seg id="2300">For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect as if he was there himself.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Oh, I love archives! "</seg>
<seg id="2302">For someone who is so beaten with old papers, that he was supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ("To be honest: I have overrated my welcome greeting") seems to be all too beautiful to be true.</seg>
<seg id="2303">Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, looking through the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the walled hyena heads on the walls and bottles that had spent centuries in trenches.</seg>
<seg id="2304">He wandered through the grounds and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with counties, gardeners and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.</seg>
<seg id="2305">"" "then, at night he drank" "" "Whiskey and started writing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2306">The intimate story of Scotney is relatively unknown, as the National Trust had only received full access in 2006, when the last heiress, Elizabeth Hussey, died.</seg>
<seg id="2307">When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees just started taking care of the archive that he described as "hundreds of years in which aristocrats said" Oh, throw it on the attic. "</seg>
<seg id="2308">"" "diaries, letters from the time of the English Empire, maps depicting what possessed:" "" "one could think that land conflicts would be boring," "" "says Rhodes," "" "but there was a birch fighting for the two families." ""</seg>
<seg id="2309">Boys, let everything go its way! "</seg>
<seg id="2310">Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immerse yourself in the English history, including 'The Labourer' that follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381.</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a record of a turmoil that occurred in the castle in 1380, in this book entitled" Knife Families of Kent and Sussex, "Rhodes says.</seg>
<seg id="2312">"" "" "" "the peasant uprising began in this area and I thought an insurrection was a good start." ""</seg>
<seg id="2313">Perhaps the two are interconnected? "</seg>
<seg id="2314">Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit patterer who hid the Darrell family for seven years during the English reformation.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Or 'The Smuggler', portrayed by the smugglers Arthur Darrell from the 18th century, who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery that was made only years later when his coffin was excavated).</seg>
<seg id="2316">The Darrells are Rhodes's favorite family of Scotney: "the guys seemed to be pretty crook, getting debts and spending money for things they could not afford.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Other generations of Darrell's men blew their debt crises by marrying wealthy old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well-looking guys, with a talent to promote landmine. "</seg>
<seg id="2318">After the end of his engagement in the castle, Rhodes is searching for other unique write experiences</seg>

<seg id="2388">The ascension of sex robots is real, and we should worry</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought it could not become even more crazy in 2017, a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots is coming.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, in fact.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big deal.</seg>
<seg id="2392">The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at Sheffield University and co-founder of the FRR, we must start taking their Ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of it, and we will see them much more frequently," said Mr. Sharkey on the publication of his new report.</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern slips have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions which are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"" "the user can" "" "adapt" "" "his robot according to his beliefs and select everything from the eye color of the robot through the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails." ""</seg>
<seg id="2398">"" "but it becomes even more disturbing, as many robots possess" "" "personalities" "" "that would make a stepford woman look progressive." ""</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern expandlips developed to robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">For example, the RealBotix robot enables its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they find appealing, such as shyness.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is the Roxxxy Gold Sex-robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed characters like "Frigid Farrah," which conveys the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxgold has a personality adapted to your personality as much as possible," warms the True Companion website.</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day, it also has its moods, just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "she can be tired, fixed on conversation or she can" "" "be in mood" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subservient female features, the allusions to rape, when one gets a step on Frigid (means here: resisting) Farrah, troubled one the most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his site true companion Roxxxy with a vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men not have Roxxxxis?" it says on the website.</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just a different sex toy.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their formation and increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture, towards a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with subjection as optional addition.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men will naturally have no sex robots, and while the FRR remembers their rising popularity, they remain tentatively at the edge of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what transpires from the marginal zones can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of time in which we live.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots are emerging in a time where women's rights are threatened around the world in which there is a president in the White House who has dared to have women being sexually assaulted.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most dreadful aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The report of the maid ') is not the graphic images, the interlaced body and the stoched eyes, but how realistically this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a jump, but at the moment this does not feel like a great leap.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The aim behind these sex robots is to create a physical likeness to actual women as realistically as technically possible (albeit with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want them to feel human, that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"" "but, to the point when it comes to its" "" "personalities" "", "the robots are not real women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no mediation or background story, nothing that hinders independence or anything that might disturb the imagination of total submission.</seg>
<seg id="2422">In other words, they are fake slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to put it in the saying of 2017: maid</seg>
<seg id="2424">Trumps great power?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense of man</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a truism of the Trump era that the political divisions, which polarized the U.S. electorate, have also split families in small formats.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, there were newspapers in the USA with advice on how to deal with the horror of troublemakers.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We all restrain ourselves to make our filter bags burst.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noticed is the power trump, families to bring together.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a poorer poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the Republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House everyone whom she knows, including the republican relationship with which she struggled for decades because of politics suddenly and very strangely on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">This is certainly a good thing about the dining table, but it is important to me that this also entails considerable risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was strengthened by Trump, but the disfigurative effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">"" "when we talk about" "" "normalisation" "" "and Trump, we refer to the creepy possibility that one day his babies will no longer be thrown out." ""</seg>
<seg id="2436">There is, however, an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump republicans "normalize" the right wing, which suddenly appear as the epitome of reasonableness in comparison to its standards.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Today, I find myself falling off from an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's funny version of the crazy - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return looked like) - both in comparison to Trump were indeed a very mild criminal offense.</seg>
<seg id="2438">If Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republicans must only be spiritually healthy in order to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the biggest of the carousels in the New York Parks department, and the best three dollars that can be spent in the city if you don't need any caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are crackling and the animals rotate in order to look full of fear about their own shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of tall buildings become old, the skylines become familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I am still not completely over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss cottage in fact - the topic-pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not one of the biggest roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">The Central Park carousel is still an odd magic experience, as two-year-old, an 11-year-old and two women can go on it in the 40-s and have all a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have evaluated the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately no one asked him.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same plus the option to pay the valuation with a 15% tip - this to buy something over the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This not only slows down what should be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store stood apologising while I was tired of the experience of submitting my credit card with five stars.</seg>

<seg id="2535">Roland Wacker, Haslachs Stadtbaumeister, goes to retirement next year.</seg>
<seg id="2536">The place is already written out - but suitable candidates are rare.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Wacker has been a city engineer for 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="2538">And the work still makes him great fun as he communicates in the press conference.</seg>
<seg id="2539">He reports on varied, but demanding tasks waiting for his successor.</seg>
<seg id="2540">At the same time, it is surprising that no application has yet fulfilled the requirements profile.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the next possible time.</seg>
<seg id="2542">In compliance with regular periods of notice, there should still be enough time for a revision.</seg>
<seg id="2543">Since Haslach is acting as a lower civil authority for the management community, the applicant has to present relevant certificates.</seg>
<seg id="2544">Because this function wants to keep the city in any case.</seg>
<seg id="2545">If they would not be able to fill them out again, the citizens would have to travel to Offenburg for advice.</seg>
<seg id="2546">But citizen's proximity is important to the city and itself, says Wacker, who reports about a good working climate and good atmosphere between the authorities and citizens.</seg>

<seg id="2562">Continuity is not only important for a good company climate but also for the further design of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2563">According to information from the town of Haslach, anyone who wants to be able to study Roland Wacker should have a completed degree as a graduate engineer or Bachelor's degree in architecture and have good expertise in the areas of construction and planning law.</seg>

<seg id="2579">Red meat, dairy products and chocolate may help to alleviate IBD (inflammation of the bowel)</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study says exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients suffering from inflammatory bowel diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable condition affecting around 1.3 million in the United States and 300,000 in the United States causes stomach cramping and flatulence, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, loss of weight and extreme tiredness.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While those affected are normally advised to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms, researchers found at the Washington University that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the gut are patrolling in order to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in the food are not penetrating into the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells capable of triggering inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging any sensitive tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the equilibrium is too far towards inflammation, it can result in an inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">Experiments have shown that a type of tolerance-promoting immune cell is found in mice carrying a certain bacterium in their intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a connection between a species of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had of these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">It suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan promotes tolerant, less inflammatory bowel milieus, if the same system is also involved in humans.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The post-doctoral candidate Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan was investigating a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same clan, but who was separate, did not.</seg>
<seg id="2593">It assumed that the difference with the intestinal microbiome of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The mice of the mice were DNA sequenced and six bacterial species found in mice with the immune cells were found, but without them missing in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in a sterile environment so that an intestinal microbiome was missing and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received L. reuteri and immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how the bacteria propagate to the immune system, researchers L. reuteri were able to grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of liquids - without the bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated from mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed to the tolerance-promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism, which is known as an indol-3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of the mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan declared that people have the same tolerant cells as mice and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether tryptophan-by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">"" "she said," "" "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote, as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine." ""</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially high tryptophan values in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population. "</seg>

<seg id="2672">Who wants to rehabilitate his house in the years can soon get support from the country.</seg>
<seg id="2673">In addition, Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of Steg city development were informed on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="2674">At the beginning of the information event, Schindler gave a review of what happened so far.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Since 1991, there have been redevelopment areas in sensitivities.</seg>
<seg id="2676">At that time, in the redevelopment area I from 1991 to 2004, the Land of Baden-Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding amount.</seg>
<seg id="2677">In the redevelopment area II from 2005 to 2016, the subsidy was still 60 percent.</seg>
<seg id="2678">For Schindler, the existing renovations are a "success project" - it is ultimately important to promote interior development, and not only to open up new areas of construction.</seg>
<seg id="2679">On April 4, the government presidium of Karlsruhe obtained the information that there will be a remediation zone III.</seg>
<seg id="2680">The funding amount amounts to 833 333 euros, of which 500,000 euros from the country, the rest of the community felt.</seg>
<seg id="2681">How does a sanitation area come about?</seg>
<seg id="2682">One will, as Schindler continue to investigate, where the "really old" homes are.</seg>
<seg id="2683">However, it also plays a role as to whether in the planned area there is any interest in rehabilitating.</seg>
<seg id="2684">If necessary, the boundaries could then shift again.</seg>
<seg id="2685">On Wednesday evening, the bridge was represented by Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel.</seg>
<seg id="2686">"" "Keller presented the contents of the" "" "Social Town" "" "federal state programme, in which the renovations would be carried out." ""</seg>
<seg id="2687">The core of the program is the revitalisation of inner cities, improving housing and working conditions, and maintaining and expanding infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="2688">The measures would be carried out objectively, that is per plot.</seg>
<seg id="2689">The redevelopment area would then finally be defined as a set of rules.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The eligibility period for the funds has been running since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Until September this year, however, the survey would only take place once again, in the framework of which the participants of the rehabilitation project got a questionnaire to fill out.</seg>
<seg id="2692">In November or December, the order intake should be carried out as soon as possible, so that the refurbishment can begin next year.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Pietzschmann subsequently explained that every Commune had to carry out the aforementioned preliminary examinations.</seg>
<seg id="2694">It is about evaluating and deciding when it is to be remedied and to what extent.</seg>
<seg id="2695">For the respective property there is also an improvement in the land register.</seg>
<seg id="2696">Pietzschmann will come even after sensibilities and make himself a picture of the situation, she promised.</seg>

<seg id="2715">The White House's decision to fly a marine helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month costs taxpayers according to the military's information left to the TIME Magazine, up to $24,000.</seg>
<seg id="2716">The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was the centrepiece of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programmes.</seg>
<seg id="2717">President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries.</seg>
<seg id="2718">The helicopter, which was made in Connecticut, was displayed next to a yacht from Maine, a fireman from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="2719">The White House Military Office required the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary arrangement or Frago, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter.</seg>
<seg id="2720">"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with a high visibility," wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event to his supervisor, the deputy naval commander for aviation.</seg>
<seg id="2721">The news showed that the helicopter arrived at the South Lawn on July 17 at 3 o'clock in the morning and so long remained until the lawn had been vacated between 18: 00 and 21: 00 on that evening.</seg>
<seg id="2722">The note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed, due to the limitation of the service hours a second crew would be required for the return flight.</seg>
<seg id="2723">The original flight crew was during the event with the helicopter while the security personnel of the unit stayed on the ground during the time on the plane.</seg>
<seg id="2724">The records provided by the TIME did not reveal whether a second flight was ultimately required.</seg>

<seg id="2863">PSG Barcelona warned against Neymar three years ago?</seg>
<seg id="2864">The page of La Liga may regret its interest in Marco Verratti</seg>
<seg id="2865">Paris Saint-Germain will not fail in their persecution by Neymar after giving an offer of £189 million to release his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona three years before the record of the world record?</seg>
<seg id="2866">The sensational base has heated the transfer window in the summer, as the League 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand, with Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United for 89 million pounds in the last season.</seg>
<seg id="2867">After finishing, Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest-paid professional athlete in the world. PSG offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week.</seg>
<seg id="2868">Barcelona is furious about the way Neymar has forced his way outside, although there is a source close to the Catalans Executive Board that the club has always given its best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="2869">But was the football world warned about this prospect three years ago by the PSG president?</seg>
<seg id="2870">When Manchester City in 2014 was interested in signing Blaise Matuidi, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a severe warning for each club, who wanted to sign one of PSG's best players.</seg>
<seg id="2871">"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, we'll face them in opposition, we will contact their players," said Al-Khelaifi.</seg>

<seg id="2874">Barcelona seems to have crossed this line, whereby the Spanish society expressed interest in the PSG midfielder Marco Verratti at the beginning of this summer.</seg>
<seg id="2875">PSG made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to travel in any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for Neymar.</seg>

<seg id="2881">On Thursday evening, the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum was driving on the B 215 from Stolzenau in the direction of Leese on the B 215 from Stolzenau.</seg>
<seg id="2882">In the area of the bypass of Stolzenau, a car met him in his lane so that he had to turn right.</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "Sparrow Sparrows" reports pope-brother Georg Ratzinger "</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen-Report on the abuses is relieved by Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">That means author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen takes care of discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement, "We are a church," after publication in comparison with the German press agency, he acquired an apology from the former bishop of Regensburg and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, as well as by the cathedral capellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of Pope Benedict XVI.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would be very useful to the prestige of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep regret about their own omissions or their false appraisal of the processes at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2894">The Vatican's newspaper "Osservatore Romano," on the other hand, criticised that in reporting on violence against the cathedral-cats, "double standards" would be measured.</seg>
<seg id="2895">Regarding the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubted that it was "shameful and shameful deeds" that would have been punished and prevented in the future; however, the "degree of media manipulation" was striking, as the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the National Italian Bioethics committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of the everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep that for normal," "" "writes Scaraffia." ""</seg>
<seg id="2897">"" "Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis said in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk:" "" "we are happy to go to the church and this is a devouring fresher." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "she also pointed out that in her youth" "" "punches have been a very normal educational tool," "" "to be done with cheeky children, as I was one." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">It is unfair to apply today's standards to previous decades, as the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports on abuse of abuse, pope-brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Completely wrong, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote to Ratzinger the "My brother of the pope" (translated into 12 languages).</seg>
<seg id="2902">"" "" "" "I have to take care of Georg Ratzinger," "" "says Hesemann," "" "because all this had nothing to do with him," "" "he evaluates the results of the final report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is written in the 440-page report that the lawyer Ulrich Weber submitted by the diocese Regensburg to the Enlightenment?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"" "between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s, 547" "" "Regensburger Domspatzen" "" "became victims of attacks, 67 Domspatzen sexually abused." ""</seg>
<seg id="2905">"" "in the final report it is said to Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994:" "" "in summary, it can be stated that in many cases Domkapellmeister has used forms of physical and psychological violence." ""</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially with high emotionality, the punishings for the pupils could also be more intense.</seg>
<seg id="2907">"" "in contrast to numerous other defendants, however, many victims have appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases even have positive memories with him." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen (Bad Ratzinger) is relieved.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "Incidents of Violence of Violence at the Regensburger Domspatzen," is a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">On the one hand, many students emphasise his "humanity."</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, he also appears as a choleric and perfectionist, which became tangible to the public if a cathedral sparrow didn't bring top performance musically.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as a biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger appears at all in it.</seg>
<seg id="2914">There are eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or co-knowledge in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The excesses of violence at the pre-school were also outside his sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">You can, at best, be accused of having experienced it too late or not having taken initial indications seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"" "the Domspatzengymnasium, on which he worked, was perceived as" "" "Redemption" "", "" "" "heaven" "" "and" "" "better world" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">The vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger give a very excellent testimony, describing him as "warm-hearted," "sincere," "sincere," "sincere," "sincere," "sincere," as extremely good-natured teacher who regularly provided the boys with cakes, biscuits and sweets and "always surrounded by grapes of children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority is complaining about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which has also led to floodfolds.</seg>
<seg id="2920">The fact that he was not only cracking with chairs and throwing the keyring on the ground, but also distributed ear cowards and overlooked all too naughty boys on the hair or ears, he himself admitted years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it.</seg>
<seg id="2921">To his salvation, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the time, the 1960s and 1970s, at both parents and teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think every one of us who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also experienced this in a secular school, a state gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what actually happened in this report, namely the terrible sexual abuse and the violent excesses at the pre-school, these are certainly bagatellen.</seg>
<seg id="2926">One wonders if it doesn't have to do with his fame and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many media have just fallen on him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">In the Bavarian pope many who have never understood him are still working diligently.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is that the report is relieved by Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the media, in connection with the report, there was much talk about the issue of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger committed in the final report any involvement or co-knowledge with regard to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: quite clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted themselves to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were initiated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I have never dared to talk about it with my father or mother," "" "said one affected representative for the others," "" "It was all very embarrassing for me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem with the education of sexual abuse was, however, that most victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they didn't even trust parents and siblings, then definitely not a choral leader, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators professionally.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Sparklinger pupils judge Ratzinger's role with regard to the misuse cases?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionable student expressed it this way: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... not a case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) had had timely insights and could have stopped the respective perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I think it... also for really absurd to assume that... Built are more insistent, or more clearly or more open than their parents, dormitory leaders, trust teachers, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That you talk to him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "thus the report comes to the very clear result:" "" "that students and / or their surroundings were familiar with it could not be confirmed in the context of the study." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">As for sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is thus acquitted of any co-knowledge.</seg>
<seg id="2943">It cannot be accused of preventing or displaying it.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore there is no reason to associate your good name with these vile crimes, as unfortunately happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "in the media, much of" "" "violent excesses" "" "was to be read among the Regensburger Domspatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">"" "the former domicile master Georg Ratzinger is accused of" "" "looking away" "" "in the report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this reproach?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: it's the big problem that everything is mixed and mixed up in the coverage of a huge melange of sexual abuse and violent excesses and somewhere in the middle, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this is precisely the misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">There is a clean separation between the pre-school and the gymnasium of the cathedral-cats, between sexual abuse and violent excesses as well as, we say, other allegations.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report covers incidents of the period since 1945, thus also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not choir director of the cathedral-cats.</seg>
<seg id="2952">All the horrible test pedagogy, the cases in which children of sadistic teachers were punched and portrayed and suffered terribly, all took place at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions have prevailed.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with them, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger didn't have anything to do, because he only got to face the boys when they were already on the Domspatzengymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">"" "on this, as most witnesses stress, the theme" "" "preschool" "" "taboo." ""</seg>
<seg id="2955">"" "it was only happy to escape and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even" "" "heavenly" "" "conditions." ""</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different on the Cathedral Physical gymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: although there was discipline, there was no sadistic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">"" "and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that" "" "many victims appreciate the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases even have positive memories with him." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2959">This way, at most, the accusation remains to be looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre-school.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970-71, when he had just begun to establish himself, and of his predecessors at a school where he was not working and responsible (so the witness) didn't want to hear anything, and then again around 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger consistently start the ears before the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Cathedral Physical gymnasium, which the report even reproduces.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "in this he points out that" "" "that in the pre-school the punishment will continue." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">Even in the face of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent action.</seg>
<seg id="2966">That was, of course, at a time when legal clarity had long been forbidden in Bavaria as a criminal offence.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that, they took place in a legal grey area, as everyone of us knows.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was also difficult for him to assess where the victims were perhaps exaggerated or dramatized and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can't say that he always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is just not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 the reprisings of schools were officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards to time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see it?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"" "Michael Hesemann: we are talking about the" "" "fallout of anachronism" "", "that is, the danger of evaluating the past according to today's moral standards." ""</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess is right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this, of course, does not apply to sexual abuse, which at all times was heinous and also not for what was broken in the pre-school of adversity and violence on innocent children's souls, that goes far beyond what was done at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2977">That's all awful and I'm glad that it will finally work.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I have to take shelter from Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Its means of discipline and punishment, so to draw ear-holdings and hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishments were then banned, it adhered strictly to it.</seg>
<seg id="2981">"" "what picture of his time in Regensburg has played Georg Ratzinger in the talks with you for the book" "" "My brother of the pope" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the subject of Prüm punishment come into speech?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, that is, Pope Benedict XVI., from his perspective, the cathedral-cats only played a secondary role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I did not at all mean that he led a strict regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But even this must be said once: without this perfectionism, without the demand of unconditional discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world trance, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and candy only one does not make any big singers and before every success, no matter what area, but always discipline, passion and overcoming-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people have you experienced by Georg Ratzinger during the talks on their book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through work on the book and beyond, I have met Georg Ratzinger really well and again and again experienced as wonderful, humorous, basic, deeply believing and heart-good people, one cannot imagine that he could do just a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I get regular contact with, how many former cathedral-cats still today, 23 years after his enery, regularly contact him, visit him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of their family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who have not forgiven him until today, that he once was strictly speaking to them, are thus clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the cathedral-cats are grateful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he is always a good fatherly teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovely respect person, to which they still look up today and who are downright dishonouring them.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, again quite clearly: everything you submit to it is educational methods that were on the order of the day.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be happy that we have long overcame this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is most unfair to make a man just because he is prominent and has a more prominent brother to become a medial scapegoat.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the evil intent behind it, too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">For the report, which was just published, relieves him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the insurrectionist would command a 93-year-old man who had acquired great merits and without the outside of Bavaria, and perhaps Germany, nobody would know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally in peace.</seg>
