J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m always put in drawers
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston doesn &apos;t have to be perfect or successful .
this has made the Hollywood star un@@ ambig@@ u@@ ously clear in an interview .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I always put in drawers or get stuck inside out labels which have little to do with me and reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t have the desire to be always perfect and successful . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be honest , these things are more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dum@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh at the fact that she is considered &quot; Miss Perfect , &quot; as explained in the current &quot; Cos@@ mop@@ olitan . &quot;
the act@@ ress likes to spend her time at home , in front of a television with a lo@@ cker@@ el D@@ utt and Mexican food , it says in the magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to the white blood she brings the question of the desire for children : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we women don &apos;t have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Hollywood star . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not Child &apos;s Play &quot; is Ani@@ ston to be seen as an all@@ uring mother of two sons .
the film runs with us from August 25th .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the pyramid of sports
his experiences on horseback are man@@ age@@ able .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger was looking for a bit of di@@ version with a ride on the beach with some colleagues .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
Chi@@ o : &quot; golden sports pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes the horses remembered their holiday , they ch@@ ased back to the feed trou@@ ghs in the fast gal@@ lo@@ p .
one kilometer at this pace , I was afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and with that the riding career ended up again .
on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer of all time - 101 drops of tournament - was again near horses .
he had his family run over the estate of the AL@@ RV , and on a horse he didn &apos;t even bo@@ ther for photo purposes .
long was the first time in Aachen and therefore also at the CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sports help handed the man from An@@ hausen within the scope of a small gala the Golden Sport@@ pyr@@ amide .
the symp@@ a@@ thetic sports@@ man is not lacking in awards .
Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz , Silber@@ nes lau@@ rel leaf , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the year ...
even the British Queen has already rebu@@ ked him .
the 18th winner of the World Pyr@@ amid is a long one .
in Aachen , he received the first award winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because it is not only awarded for athle@@ tic success , but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for decades , Lan@@ ger has been promoting junior staff .
and so he also announced the prize money of EUR 25,000 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with 15 other outstanding sports@@ men , the two @-@ time US master winner was added to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the awards include athletes of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the gymn@@ asts of Cornelia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Reu@@ der Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Reu@@ der Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the rider Al@@ win Sch@@ ock@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ thum@@ ously the Hand@@ b@@ aller Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich .
many of these sports le@@ vers had come to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company moved to the Spring@@ field , where the Lav@@ azza Award was running .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept distance to the big animals .
Clinton &apos;s and Tru@@ mp@@ s economic policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; investing in infrastructure and preventing T@@ TP trade agreement - both Clinton and Tru@@ mp want to do so . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the two U.S. presidential candidates are not at odds with tax and energy policies , as well as in a fundamental issue .
the differences in economic policy between Donald Tru@@ mp and H@@ illary Clinton constitute a fundamental , rather philosophical difference .
der , about the role of the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tru@@ mp is in doubt rather small and warns against how the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and to regulate death , he says .
he himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , claimed Tru@@ mp .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will decline regulations greatly , and he is making himself strong for far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private persons and for companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton said : the state has certain tasks to accomplish , it has dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities to open up and needs money .
that is why the taxes for the rich would increase , they say .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic infrastructure .
in reality , Tru@@ mp and Clinton say almost word @-@ like .
the democratic candidate has even announced the biggest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programmes in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state @-@ critical party party of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
on the other hand , there could be internal discussions on tur@@ mp .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the differences in energy and climate policy are more evident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tru@@ mp plans to build coal @-@ fired power stations and boost coal mining in the US again .
oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas , and wants to termin@@ ate the Paris Climate Protection Agreement .
Clinton , on the other hand , wants to expand and demand renew@@ ables with her investment program : &quot; a country will become the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want us to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only in the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far apart .
T@@ PP , the transp@@ os@@ fic trade agreement , do not want to sign .
at the same time , however , both want to not isol@@ ate the US from international trade - but simply protect American jobs better .
they should then be paid better , Clinton demands .
the current minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a wage .
it wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour .
what Tru@@ mp wants to do on this matter is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage has to r@@ attle , then he says he must not be changed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the big discussion of the coming months would probably be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand is Tru@@ mp , who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his critics point to him that the budget deficit would be even greater .
on the other hand Clinton , who at least wants to demand from the rich wants to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution either .
&quot; &quot; &quot; escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every woman fled has experiences with sexual violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual violence belongs to women who are fle@@ eing alone , almost everyday life .
when they arrive in Germany they are often traumati@@ zed .
a house offers refuge .
four women sit in a large kitchen .
each one has a baby , which is at most one year old .
one has put her little son in her arms .
he gaz@@ es curi@@ ously into the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es at the table @-@ top .
until she notices that she is observed .
she smil@@ ed briefly and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene works normally .
until you talk with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is the division manager of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a suppor@@ ter of social welfare services in Bavaria , and deals among other things with the topic of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are poultry .
they live in the Munich north in one of the few de@@ centralized hotels for all @-@ fle@@ dged women and their children in Bavaria .
in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs set up the establishment together with pro Familia and the Munich women &apos;s aid .
recently it was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - not as a visitor .
the exception is a guard in front of the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not exagger@@ ation to say : every woman who arrives here has experiences with sexual violence on her flight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee for wars because they are persecuted in politics because torture or death thre@@ aten them or because their families send them to Europe as hope @-@ bear@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in women there are other reasons for the escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many steal away secretly because they see no other way out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in their homeland , they have experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , honorary mor@@ als , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
this is what drives them away .
on the run it continues .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , the tu@@ gs for a bottle of water demand a sexual act is not a r@@ arity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
who believes that the end as soon as they anchor in Germany tells B@@ ahr .
here too , single women in refugee camps would often be considered inferior and ab@@ used at worst .
this means that around 90 percent of the women living in the Shel@@ ter in the north of Munich are traumati@@ zed , they estimate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children are certainly not born voluntarily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are so used to say nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they don &apos;t dare to talk openly about the experience because the shame is too big . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often don &apos;t know to help , it needs more accommodation just for them , requires B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the housing of refugees .
to the question whether they knew about a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction , some respond with no .
in the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia there is something like that in housing of governments .
even in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone , fle@@ eing women are not housed separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokes@@ man of the government .
in Upper Bavaria , Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia and Central Fran@@ con@@ ia there are in some common shel@@ ters of floors or own houses only for single women and their children .
the exception is Nieder@@ bay@@ ern , there are two central accommodations only for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Women &apos;s Rights and Gender E@@ quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; committee in the European Parliament also calls for women to be separated from men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the committee , it says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women are accommodated separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the privacy is missing or men and women are accommodated together , it can be - perpet@@ ual - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially the wash@@ rooms should be separated and accessible to women easily , is in the study . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much the women feel this need of protection can be read in the queue made to the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since it has been around for us , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one could easily make a second home .
assistant doctors strike : demands for new employment campaign activities
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Deputy of the Assistant Profession@@ als asked their union to authori@@ ze new labour camps in their dispute with respect to a new contract . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( B@@ MA ) called for its entire Council to appro@@ ve more work campaigns starting at the beginning of September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the J@@ DC said that ministers should have agreed to address the concerns regarding the contract . &quot; &quot; &quot;
assistant doctors and medical students agreed in July about the rejection of a contract agreed with the B@@ MA .
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in the elections .
in a letter to the members who was released on Thursday night on Twitter , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government &quot; persist@@ ently cal@@ m@@ ly &quot; stuck to problems , which led to the treaty being refused .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of this , the J@@ DC Board agreed to fully reject the proposed new treaty and solic@@ it official new negotiations on all your concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Board today issued a formal request for a special meeting of the B@@ MA Council to appro@@ ve an ongoing program of escal@@ ating labor campaign preparations beginning at the beginning of September .
the disputes caused assistants to strike six times this year , the first overall failures in the history of the N@@ HS .
the head of the B@@ MA assistant Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana res@@ ig@@ ned after the election to reject the agreed contractual conditions that had been recommended by the B@@ MA .
he granted members to B@@ MA during the meetings , which took place before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 assistants and medical students , with the fact that the contract was beneficial and should be accepted .
following the vote , the Minister of Health , Jerem@@ y H@@ unt said that the contract for doctors in England would be forci@@ bly introduced .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and announce an official end of the eight @-@ month @-@ long war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gil@@ ded hall of the St. Petersburg Palace , I cannot deny that Ankara wants this reconciliation .
there was the hand@@ shake , yes .
but Putin &apos;s smile was imp@@ acted and he barely radi@@ ated warmth , even for his restra@@ ined circumstances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an , on the other hand , spoke of his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dear friend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin - according to a report whole five times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it anymore .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but can even be improved .
the next day , a newspaper described that Erd@@ og@@ an had beha@@ ved as if there had never been anything worse .
it seemed to me that his enthusiasm was rather the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s eman@@ ating , sustainable cool@@ ness showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had nothing to forget .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory words : the shooting of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was fur@@ ious .
Putin dealt and accused Ankara of falling into the backs of Russia .
the off@@ ence was even bigger since it was committed by a supposed friend .
to restore the ve@@ to will be difficult , if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months state @-@ controlled media carried out a fierce , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
suddenly it seemed as if the Turks would blame for everything .
most serious were the accus@@ ations of senior officials that Erd@@ og@@ gans would have benefited their own family from illegal oil trade in Syria which is controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he v@@ ehem@@ ently denied this .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse from President Erd@@ og@@ an , who he wanted to hear .
Russia could book a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ as@@ ef@@ ire are obvious .
Erd@@ og@@ an urgently needs all the friends he can get after he has been reli@@ eved of his ministry last month at a failed state empire .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shocked him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey severely - in particular the ban on charter flights which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year .
the number has decreased by almost 90 % .
in Russia , travel agents and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights are res@@ um@@ ed .
they count on a late seasonal rush to the Mediterranean .
this week , the state TV projected cheap fruit and vegetables once the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti formulated it as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is fur@@ ious on the West as it regards its response to trying to seize power as a weak answer .
this includes continuing gru@@ dge over the sn@@ ail pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is anxious to benefit from the cool atmosphere and to reduce the relationship between Turkey and the West .
in Ankara , the Russian chief of state won a bonus that he demanded support for the elected authorities after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
this is a matter of course for Moscow that has a deep fear of regime change .
the summit meeting in this brilliant palace at the sea made it possible for Russia and Turkey to present an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; to me as an analy@@ st : two countries that viol@@ ate the West and feel badly treated and now f@@ aint .
nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still big differences between the two .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently given its role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides .
it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks , both pres@@ idents mentioned at the press conference that they did not even touch the subject .
the President of Turkey intentionally avoided answering a question of their differences , while Putin decided to stress this .
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster than NATO member Turkey fired on the Russian military jet - it is certainly better that the two He@@ ads of State speak at least once more .
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for customers outside Scotland
according to the Bank &apos;s CEO , R@@ BS will only be reduced to a back office role .
Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan showed Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was associated with the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
since then , the bank has dist@@ anced itself since it had to be saved and saved almost collap@@ sed eight years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this period brand strate@@ gi@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have used to protect other end @-@ consumers &apos; brands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she supported international sports with millions of pounds of sponsorship , from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now it has decided to put more national marks into focus .
Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales all RS@@ B references , the de@@ centralised headquarters and the stock market noti@@ fications are changed to Nat@@ West .
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other smaller brands for private banking , which will be more important - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dru@@ m@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brand RS@@ B becomes our investor @-@ brand as well as the brand under which our employees will be employed as we now become more to a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I now say that we are not pursuing global goals , but local goals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
each of these brands will stand in their own communities for something completely different and our employees will work with the customers among these brands .
R@@ BS has already said that it will no longer be sponsored by the Six Nations sponsor@@ ing and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the various brands in its sport sponsor@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is time for us to develop into the bank of brands , because how do we focus internally ( we have asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the CEO . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago if we said that we would be a great bank for our customers and would have launched these brands .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think , you will see many changes .
we can launch these marks again , so I think the time has come .

the jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured its 3,@@ 000@@ th British profit on Friday at New@@ market .
he made a milestone at Pre@@ dil@@ ection , which is practi@@ sed by John Gos@@ sel , on his local race track with his second win of the night .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey , who reaches the milestone in the flat race .
he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son .
the three @-@ time winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who won G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar before , said : &quot; it is something special . &quot;
I &apos;m very emotional because my family is here as well
I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I ended up here 30 years ago .
it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday night with 20,000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori postpon@@ es the jubil@@ ee when he pi@@ cks up the victory on Pre@@ dil@@ ection
two jo@@ ck@@ eys reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and retired 20 @-@ channel winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who scored more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a record breaking career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time Der@@ by@@ winner had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career successes
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of Moder@@ nis@@ m and it &apos;s no surprise that he has reached this milestone that few have reached before him .
he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intell@@ ect that distinguishes it from the others in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and char@@ ism enthusiastic fans for years for this sport .
I told Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he had already picked up 6.000 pieces if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and big tournament jo@@ ckey !
Frank@@ ie has ri@@ dden already nearly 30 years winner in the UK , which is great .
he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition he is an incredible jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying D@@ mount
from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flagship of the British flat race for two decades .
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a whole series of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gl@@ orious Seven &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in 1996 at As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and received a prohibition of drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three years ago , he initially had difficulties when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive omni@@ pot@@ ence to de@@ fy his doub@@ ters and return to his best form .
and he is not yet at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori once said that he wants to continue on competitions up to his at least 5 years old .
Russian Putin firing staff head Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has un@@ expect@@ edly released his head of staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was part of the strict confidence circuit of Putin for many years .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed Special Represent@@ ative for Environmental and Transport Affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a statement by the Krem@@ lin , it reads that without giving reasons , Putin said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the release of Ivan@@ ov@@ s from his duties as Chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who has been a deputy since 2012 , was named his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in Tall@@ inn in 1972 , he graduated from the prestigious State Moscow Institute of International Relations ( M@@ GI@@ MO ) and worked in Tokyo &apos;s Embassy in Tokyo .
on the website of the Krem@@ lin it is said ( in Russian ) that he later was the head of the cler@@ k and chief of the staff .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said about his appointment as Putin : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is the government &apos;s main duty to support your activity as head of state in regards to draft laws and inspections to implement your instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Putin told the Russian TV broad@@ ca@@ ster on Friday that Ivan@@ ov was asked to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
are the smiling faces convincing ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
for a long time Ser@@ yo@@ z@@ ha Ivan@@ ov was one of the closest confi@@ d@@ ants Vladimir Putin and works like he for the Soviet intelligence service , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin broadcast on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff res@@ ig@@ ns at his own request .
but despite the s@@ miles for the cameras , a few of them are convinced , especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
so is the consequence of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows this at present .
but the official statement - that a man who once was promoted as a potential president - at once would like to direct Russian environmental policy - pushed for great scep@@ ticism .
in his remarks to Putin , cited on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said : &quot; it &apos;s true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 to give me this very complicated post - you could almost say - entr@@ ust my job for four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V accepted the post in December 2011 .
prior to that , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and how Putin is a former member of the K@@ GB State Security Service .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the German Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed his deputy .
when Putin reached power he called Ivan@@ ov one of five people whom he trusted most .
it was once believed that after Putin &apos;s second term of office , Ivan@@ ov could become President of Russia since a third term of Putin had viol@@ ated the constitution .
but this post was taken by another allies of Putin , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became Prime Minister before he became president three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he hit producers
Gib@@ son was involved in a physical examination of the set of the series in Los Angeles last month .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios , who produced the series , announced their dis@@ mis@@ sal in a joint statement .
Gib@@ son , who played the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , ap@@ ologi@@ zed on Thursday before announc@@ ing his dis@@ mis@@ sal .
on the set there were artistic differences and dis@@ agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details on how the character Gib@@ sons from the series , which follows a team of FB@@ I agents , is expected to be published at a later date , according to ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old , who previously played in the Sit@@ com Dhar@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g , has been with us since the first season of the series in 2005 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I love criminal record and have put all my heart blood within the last twelve years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gib@@ son in a release published on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was hoping to be there until the end , but it will not be possible anymore .
I would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans who can only wish for a series .
the planned broadcast of the twel@@ fth season is scheduled for September 28 .
puzzles for fish that landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
one inhabit@@ ant of Ban@@ ff called for help with the identification of fishes , which appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks that the 75 fish could be a sandwich spread out of a fountain .
Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , published on Per@@ is@@ cope a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two inches long fishes .
Que@@ ens@@ ferry crossing : bridge now associated with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the North deck of the Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings to the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - which means that the bridge is now connected to fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four closure of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ceiling b@@ lower &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is approaching completion by each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge @-@ section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30.000 tons .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 slan@@ ted cables .
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017 .
economy minister Keith Brown paid a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is an historical and symbolic moment when building the Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic degree in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel , which were used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the closure between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for the fit .
overall , almost 79 % of the total deck is at their place and the last part of the deck is getting a concrete shot for the deck in Ros@@ y@@ th , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Martin , project manager of For@@ th Crossing Chain Construc@@ tors said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first sh@@ utter represents a significant milestone for each bridge project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this fantastic project represents the closure of tr@@ end@@ setting high and low construction .
after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the northern tower on the northern tower , we had to close the existing gap in the north or north side of the country .
this was reached 700 millimeters south by pulling the northern feeder bridge .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
massive because the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 2@@ 22 metres long , weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at a slope of about 3 % .
delicate since the tolerances on which the team worked were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimeters thick .
fortunately everything went very well .
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have luck to be alive
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luck to be alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after they were thrown off by her fishing boat to Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station crashed on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T alarm after a crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulties to swim in safety while their boat moved from their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw how the boat turned around and turned the worst off , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately , the strong winds ble@@ w the boat out of reach , until we left the boat , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found hanging on a bu@@ o@@ y without a life@@ jacket .
they were all aboard the shore rescue boat and were taken back to the rescue station .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men who were thrown into the water have luck un@@ har@@ med and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boat engine had an emergency stop , but this loos@@ ened the boat from the person who controlled the boat .
someone has watched over these men today .
badly injured - man stab@@ bed his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and badly injured .
as the police announced yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old got the key to the apartment to get his personal things .
instead , the alcoholi@@ zed perpetr@@ ator cut off the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend .
when she came to the apartment he twice fell on her .
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured at the hand and in the body .
the police could arrest the perpetr@@ ator .
while the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend , he called his mother .
this al@@ er@@ ted his sister .
together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother .
but she could not move him to leave the apartment .
so she went out of the house with her partner .
on the road they met the husband &apos;s ex @-@ partner .
when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old pushed his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend .
who builds up cheap apartments from Braunschweig ?
the SPD and the Green Group are saying : in the future , investors should be taken much more seriously .
how to react to bad news that in the next few years Br@@ uns@@ wick will lose almost 1300 favourable apartments ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD will propose a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Living Room &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the next session . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but stri@@ fe is programmed .
first of all , it is about the question : who is supposed to build the cheap apartments ?
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D Group president Christoph Brat@@ mann comments : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : whoever wants to build on urban areas must in future reject 20 percent of all apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the favorable apartments can , however , also arise in the continu@@ ance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the big dispute in the town hall is , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How do you deal with investors who want to build on private areas ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors to build at least 10 percent of these areas , but as much as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new housing construction programme , which will cost millions and still needs to be financed , is to provide incentives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the problem , so Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U wants investors to set up as few regulations as possible .
the Left wants even harder jobs for investors .
in spite of this , so Brat@@ mann , a sharpen@@ ing of the situation on the housing market opens .
if the concept of action is implemented , this will take care of additional tasks in the building management .
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers .
but the programme is not yet complete : the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway .
but how do you reconci@@ le the loss of other around 1300 advantageous apartments , whose funding will exp@@ ire in the coming years ?
there will be 500 homes by 2020 alone .
in order to prevent this , as the planning policy spokesperson Nicole Palm , now exp@@ iring links should be purchased from the city .
in addition , it would have to be thought about getting the apartments back into the price relationship .
this is possible in the western city .
the problem could be solved in one fell s@@ woo@@ p .
because in the western city , Fri@@ sten will run out at the end of the year .
around 1800 apartments could be brought back into the price range for cheap apartments .
only : this does not mean the owners , the apartment construction companies .
because the number of social housing in the western city is dramatically increased , one removes itself from the goal of so @-@ called confusion .
there should be no more concentration of socially dis@@ advant@@ aged people in just a few parts of the city .
the Gre@@ ens count on the fact that there will be movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; s &amp; D Group president Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke comments : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a broad majority , the CD@@ U must go on board . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the focus is on more building sites for single @-@ family homes .
but what does not mean that a compromise is not yet to be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that is worth
it is fascinating to see how the world is changing .
the fact that teenagers and children are no longer going out to play outside , but rather prefer to spend their leisure time star@@ ing on screens has been compl@@ ained by many over the last decade .
Pok@@ emon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active .
the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV , then vide@@ og@@ ames and most recently on smartphones .
it is therefore great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not mutually exclude each other .
I refer , of course , to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on the characters created for the video games in the 1990s ( later a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs were created .
as many phenomena of pop culture , interest in the publication of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand declined in early July .
the market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed by the massive demand that the server over@@ loaded .
within a few days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users as Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , the players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pok@@ emon that are tra@@ cked with a GPS and once they have been found , they can be &quot; photograph@@ ed &quot; ( via a screen@@ shot on the mobile phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the tur@@ key and jump@@ ed for the search of the sofa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the U.S. , the game led to a considerable rise in steps that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; average &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; person re@@ counts every day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Car@@ di@@ pole , an app for Apple Watch , followed by 3@@ 5.000 users , announced the Washington Post recently that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of subsequent people who exercise every day 30 minutes , from 45 percent jump@@ ed to 53 percent .
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it only sees the raw data to improve performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many public health awareness campaigns that people want to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; take 30 minutes &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; coming from the sofa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; being active every day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ble@@ w on de@@ af ears because many public messages are d@@ ull to health and come from people who look mis@@ erable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the importance of sports cannot be over@@ valued .
those who regularly exercise sports will reduce their chances of getting cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here .
but the wonderful thing about Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something in the open air that makes them fun .
thus , three pillars of health are covered - exercise , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
some people even close friend@@ ships on the hunt .
as always there are also gru@@ es@@ ome game destro@@ yers which always have to complain about something .
and yes , someone could walk against a door .
what is it supposed to be ?
a breakthrough happened .
even if Smartphone @-@ Apps like Fit@@ bit were able to track our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to play sport as it does this game .
the new will lose its charm and the use will be followed by time .
however , due to Pok@@ em@@ ons &apos;s success , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ist in the real world , helping a lot of people in the hunt to be more active , f@@ itter and heal@@ thier .

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in the Dam@@ ent@@ ur@@ nen
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Simone Bil@@ es is immune to all that .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ lessly on the beam .
breathtaking on the ground .
brilliant on whole line .
and now finally Olympic champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast mel@@ ted on Thursday to the multi @-@ campaign title , enlar@@ ging the gap between herself and the rest of the world before all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
her overall score of 6@@ 2,@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly before the Silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; team cam@@ er@@ adi@@ n A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze med@@ alists Ali@@ ya Must@@ afa .
the American women Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ nt on the bri@@ m@@ bar during the individual multi @-@ campaign female of women at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American , who wins a multi @-@ campaign title and in total the fifth , while holding her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all .
she burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment ended .
this success is in the same league as unique athletes such as Michael P@@ helps , who have brought their sports into new heights :
Bil@@ ly has dominated the sport in the last three years , including 10 gold med@@ als - including 10 gold med@@ als - including 10 gold med@@ als - with so amazing exercises that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Res@@ cue from her said that she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
it awa@@ ited her last test in Brazil , a competition that was not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a load of over@@ sized expectations .
not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be considered a dis@@ appointment .
the Americans Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace each other once they have won gold and silver in the single multi @-@ battle female of women at the 2016 Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday
Bil@@ ly took the first medal on Tuesday , while she served as an ex@@ clamation mark on the farewell party of retired team coordinator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i .
although Bil@@ es insist@@ ed on having never planned the future , it is not true .
part of their floor exercises - containing their typical tum@@ bling pass - is matched to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympi@@ a@@ Arena in Rio .
this is no accident .
this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and was discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother during a school excursion to the gymn@@ asi@@ um where Bo@@ or@@ man trained , became a force .
since the summer of 2013 she has no longer lost a competition , a series of victories that will stop as long as Bil@@ es wishes .
even though Must@@ afa was easy through two turns , the picture was mur@@ dering .
bri@@ g@@ beams and ground bases - in which Bil@@ es keeps the world title track - lau@@ tered .
she picked up again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the floating bar - and put another on top with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor .
Ra@@ is@@ man hu@@ g@@ ged her sof@@ tly as they expected her en@@ vy - a pure form@@ ality - and tears flow@@ ed onto Bil@@ ly shiny red , white and blue E@@ yel@@ iner , when the vision she once described in her book book became a reality .
Ra@@ is@@ man &apos;s performance was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal went to Must@@ afa in a ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke .
this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team captain , who is called &quot; grand@@ ma &quot; by the Americans , had a lead .
after their ground exercise , she threw K@@ us@@ sh@@ ausen to the public , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes appeared du@@ bi@@ ously .
as for Bil@@ es , the rapidly spreading twe@@ eter of the 19 @-@ year @-@ olds has a completely new meaning at the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims killed in mur@@ der@@ ous mur@@ der@@ ers when listening to music in the car
according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl were shot , who died in one of the dead@@ liest attacks for a decade in the first giant sl@@ ump of pho@@ enix as they stopped in the car and heard music .
Stefanie Rochelle Liner , Stefanie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12 , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said .
the perpetr@@ ator fired eight shots from a hand @-@ fired weapon , while he was standing on the passenger side of the car and subsequently fled with another vehicle to read in the report .
the police announced that triple murder does not seem to have been the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y , since the att@@ acker did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 who were in possession of one of the adult victims .
Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting led the investig@@ ators to see if they were connected with four previous attacks .
in total , seven people were killed in His@@ panic residential neighbor@@ hoods in four months and two more were injured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is happening in a residential neighborhood in front of a house , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Howard of the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , beginning of the month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is assumed that the suspect has used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ an from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to reveal the evidence they have led to the conclusion that the attacks have been linked and were committed by the same assass@@ in .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hosp@@ ital@@ ised because of her injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on site .
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report about the shooting , which aimed at an empty pickup truck half an hour before triple murder and from which it was assumed that it was the work of serial killer .
investig@@ ators found pat@@ ron@@ age sleeves and secured a ball from the seat , as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cephal@@ y : &quot; it gets better &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother .
but like most of his contem@@ por@@ aries Ed@@ mund Micro@@ cephal@@ y , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing during her pregnancy .
when he first came home , my first thought was , I don &apos;t manage it .
I don &apos;t manage it .
I did not let myself in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what is wrong at all -- of course , you got involved in it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
your husband Vincent and her have been told that Ed@@ mund will never be able to identify them and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alize him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my first answer to this was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I did not know that people are still doing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ed@@ mund can walk with the help of a walking aid .
Ed@@ mund was not able to sit or craw@@ l up to his third year of life and he still can &apos;t speak .
but he is progres@@ sing slowly .
it can run with support and cycle .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Ed@@ mund has imagined for &quot; ple@@ ading me something . &quot;
&quot; we teach him sign language , &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News .
but it is not a typical sign language -- it says . Ed@@ mund has invented some notes alone .
micro@@ cephal@@ y has a variety of causes : genetic as well as infection with viruses such as meas@@ les or the zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and predic@@ tions may vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of infected with the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to recalls the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I constantly asked what is going to happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t know .
I haven &apos;t asked for the prog@@ nosis for a long time , because I don &apos;t expect anyone to really tell me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful suggestion for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
it will be better .
you know that it will get better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
heavy rainf@@ all , floo@@ ding gives rise to rescue in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi
heavy rainf@@ alls and large @-@ scale floo@@ ds in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to call on the not@@ ary on Friday .
numerous rivers in the southeast of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi flooded their banks and threatened with large @-@ scale floo@@ ds after extreme rainf@@ alls , reported the National Weather Service .
the governor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards informed that civil servants are in constant contact with the local authorities and help the municipalities concerned .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Pre@@ par@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , informed that the requests for flood vehicles , boats and sand bags grew .
Ste@@ ele said that the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa had claimed ten thousand sand bags .
a floo@@ ding warning system is used for large parts in southern Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
the weather service proclaimed that additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area .
in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama a flood warning system was used on Friday , while it was ra@@ ining in the area of mobile .
the River Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the River Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , both in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , are all likely to reach record levels over the weekend .
the Met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could flood a lot of houses near Bat@@ on Rouge .
he also said that a downstream del@@ u@@ ge in Ascension Par@@ ish is a danger , as these rivers only slowly flow into the Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as .
the river Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi state border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level at 09.@@ 00 on Friday , which was ever recorded .
rescue teams still recru@@ ited people from the flood water in the districts of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the southwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were saved on Friday near Glo@@ ster .
Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water of Be@@ aver Creek , which is normally more than 400 feet away from his home , rose greatly over night .
he said that another step @-@ man who lived near would have warned him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we woke up and the water flow@@ ed and rus@@ hed in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my waist .
his wife said Hans@@ ford that she had never seen such a flood of river in the 48 years she lived there .
Hans@@ ford said that he and his family members would have all the disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim .
Hans@@ ford said that N@@ oth@@ el@@ fer had saved all three in a large military truck and would have brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they stayed until Friday .
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the flood had spread &quot; quickly , &quot; as there were severe rainf@@ alls and that the authorities were considering evacu@@ ation instructions .
according to K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann , an observer in the vicinity of Liv@@ ing@@ stone reported from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain .
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the soil was completely absorbed by the rainf@@ alls since Wednesday .
the authorities stated that heavy rainf@@ all and floo@@ ds caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and teaching events in five school districts .
the C@@ BS subsidiary WW@@ L reported that an or@@ derly in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ ua 200 flooded houses .
the inhabitants were evacu@@ ated into two churches , which now both were flooded .
the leader of the Rob@@ by Miller congregation said that the authorities would have saved 72 people and seven domestic animals washed by the floo@@ ds .
in the towns of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were set up to accommodate the evacu@@ ees .
&quot; once the water starts to go back , they will be able to return to their homes , &quot; he said .
in the town of Ham@@ mond of the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozen streets were closed due to the floo@@ ding and sand@@ bags made for residents to take part , who hope to keep the water out of their houses and shops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last major floo@@ ding we had was in March , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the Municipal Administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , the Emer@@ gency Manager Rupert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Coun@@ t@@ ys said it was ra@@ ining on the Gulf Coast .
according to his statements , a handful of houses on Thursday were reported to have been reported to be flooded , but on Friday , no reports have been reported .
Keith Town@@ son , manager at shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen water in places I &apos;ve never seen before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Town@@ son , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it &apos;s still coming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; pun@@ ched by spheres , &quot; survived shooting in Philadelphia
the police informs that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia this week , this week already the second time that a 6 @-@ year @-@ old child is shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
the grand@@ parents stated that Brown was suffering from several shot violations , including in the l@@ ende , leg , arm and stomach , but that he was in consciousness during his transportation to the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has done a lot , his little body was overwhel@@ med by bul@@ lets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said his grand@@ mother , Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z , to the station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I just can &apos;t believe it .
the boy &apos;s condition was rated as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the family of the boy told the station that he is expected to recover again .
he should have started the first class in a local elementary school .
brown was one of four people shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in a stable state according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the boy was found on the front seat of a car , together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who was found in a critical state , reports the transmitter .
the other two victims were not in the car , and the police just as@@ cer@@ tained whether one of the injured men could be the perpetr@@ ator .
investig@@ ators told C@@ BS Philadelphia that it seems to have come to a cross@@ fire between several sho@@ ot@@ ers .
cartridge shells for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which were traced back to different assault ri@@ f@@ le , se@@ wed the crime scene .
it seems that this is clearly a continuing struggle .
there were sleeves on the road on both sides of the side@@ walk .
it seems that there have been several armed warri@@ ors who were actively involved , &quot; said police officer Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di of the police in Philadelphia to the station .
there were also several houses and vehicles hit in the area .
there was no det@@ en@@ tions and the police are currently re@@ viewing the surveillance video .
on Tuesday , another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a j@@ ag@@ ger at the arm when she played in front of her house in West O@@ ak Lane .
she reco@@ vers and the police still looks for a suspect .
why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I imagine under the women &apos;s olymp@@ i@@ hood in gymn@@ as@@ tics and that is more than one reason .
first of all , since 1984 I have been part of every summer Olympics and the USA has never been so dominant .
and second , this team has three gymn@@ asts , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired many young girls from other skin colors .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew@@ ess and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ y@@ wheel , which is ca@@ tho@@ lic , makes everybody proud .
this team finally reflects the US .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and his@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years , the number one among female Tur@@ ner@@ esses was an American @-@ American .
last year Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
that shows strength .
at the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America che@@ ered .
now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple World Championship in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they delivered unexpected , but master@@ ful gy@@ ms rout@@ inely .
on Thursday , Simone became the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American , who won gold at an individual multi @-@ campaign event .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we experience the top of this sport , but we do not see sports classes throughout the country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all hit the same path as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to get it into the Olympic team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Last Five &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because the next Olympic team will have only four gymn@@ asts in the team . furthermore , the last year is Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the reality is that gymn@@ as@@ tics are expensive sports and gymn@@ asts are primarily in private trainers , which are maintained by parents who pay for training , setup , travel clothing , competition and hotel costs ( for trainers and their gymn@@ asts and families ) .
the majority of these turn@@ around are in prosper@@ ous suburbs that can support business .
in these clubs , gymn@@ asts get their entire training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have both trained their athletes since they started doing gymn@@ as@@ tics .
we have to allow the churches to be inspired by innum@@ erable , young girls , who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a more affordable and easy @-@ to @-@ reach gymn@@ asi@@ um .
I founded my gym of 20 years .
in my events , we have offered free and affordable gymn@@ as@@ tics in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban you@@ ths ( especially black and his@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer youth high @-@ quality gymn@@ as@@ tics , which deserve the opportunity to learn and profit from this great Olympic sport .
gymn@@ as@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team , bringing thousands of young girls interested in gymn@@ as@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sport , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thanks to Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real presentation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; thanks to the Hol@@ en of the Olympic team gol@@ ds and thanks , so many young girls were motivated with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women .
assistant doctors want to organise further strikes after rej@@ ecting Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts &apos;s proposal
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by accepting a re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7.@@ 000 assistance doctors who voted in a vote rejected him .
in July H@@ unt plans to introduce the treaty and said that the N@@ HS would be in a &quot; no man &apos;s land &quot; and any further delay would be detri@@ mental to the employees and patients .
the first assistance investig@@ ators shall receive a new contract , which includes changes to night and weekend courses to improve care for un@@ related times .
Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the president of the B@@ MA committee for assistance investig@@ ators said last night in a communication with : &quot; assistance investig@@ ators still have serious concerns about the proposed contract , in particular that it will heat the current staff crisis and take it to meet all doctors . &quot;
with only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors falls under the new contract , progress has to be made and time runs out .
efforts on the part of the B@@ MA to resolve disputes by convers@@ ing with the government for a reluc@@ t@@ ance to participate and sometimes silence at a de@@ af@@ ening silence .
this was the case of a promise that Jerem@@ y H@@ unt had made about it last month that his door would always be open .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jerem@@ y H@@ unt needs to act now , lift up the necessity and address the concerns of the assistant doctors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he does not do so , the assistant doctors have made it clear that they are ready to carry out other campaign activities .
the last strike at the end of April saw a surge of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , since nur@@ ses and specialists were involved to cover doctors on the stri@@ ker chain .
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by accepting the re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association .
the B@@ MA would like to receive a better week@@ day pay for the 5@@ 4,000 resident doctors who are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , General Director of the N@@ HS employees , asked the assistance investig@@ ators to stop the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; labor Camp@@ aig@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not achieve anything that is little , but already load over@@ loaded teams and service providers and only wor@@ rying , need and inter@@ ruption to patients , nur@@ ses and their families . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last two months , we spoke to the assistance committee of the Assist@@ ance Physi@@ cians and responded positively to concerns about tut@@ el@@ age and whist@@ leb@@ ings with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries .
the employers hoped that continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as posting , flexibility in training , additional training for those returning from vocational training , training camps and gender @-@ specific wage differenti@@ als in medicine - were a sign of how seriously it was the employers , Health Education England and the Ministry of Health in respect of the agreements with the B@@ MA in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ per day medication that can lower heart rate risk
thousands of heart attacks patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day medication after being recommended by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time .
the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ant medication T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
the medicine is administered after a heart attack for 12 months , thereby reducing the risk of stroke or another heart attack .
the N@@ ICE Regul@@ atory Authority recommended a four @-@ year long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ ICE Regul@@ atory Authority recommended a four @-@ year long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
around 14@@ 0,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer from another heart attack or stroke .
heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls that form bel@@ lows .
when the floor@@ covering breaks apart , it can cause a blood c@@ lot which stops the flow of blood to the heart and thus causes a heart attack .
when the blood cl@@ ots dissolve , it can flow through the blood@@ stream and clo@@ g the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
persons who already have a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another one .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and marketed under the trade name of Bri@@ cli@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more impro@@ b@@ able .
the draft of N@@ ICE published today recommends a 12 month dose of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Health Technology Centre , said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have considerable negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that in combination with aspir@@ in , T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is effective in reducing other heart attacks and stro@@ kes in people who already had a heart attack .
with a preliminary recommendation from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it .
the information on efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - above all the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ tness makes electoral fraud flour@@ ishing in Muslim regions
the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ sk Rah@@ man was removed last year due to the release of a government report on corruption from office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ tness has led to widespread ignor@@ ing of widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities as an anni@@ hil@@ ating governmental report today revealed .
Sir Eric Pick@@ les former cabinet member verb@@ ally attacks the police , election ob@@ servers and town halls to refrain from ignor@@ ing electoral fraud on the basis of &quot; intoler@@ ance regarding eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot;
the former minister of integration and communal government , who is now a politi@@ cian king , said that intim@@ id@@ ation from religious reasons would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off barrier tapes outside of voting cabins to protect intim@@ id@@ ated voters .
he recommends that voters should lead a card to prove their identity in elections .
at present , a vot@@ er must only name his name and address .
the report proposes to apply non @-@ removable ink on a person &apos;s finger if they give up their vote to prevent someone sel@@ ects twice .
whist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should preserve more protection , says Sir Eric .
it demands that the press should have more access to municipal documents and decisions made by un@@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not only for election fraud but also to protect the municipal government from the wider corruption and financial fraud culture that is associated with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was ordered by Dow@@ ning Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets election sc@@ and@@ als in the east of London .
last year , a special court ruled that the acting mayor Lut@@ sk was to be dismissed after a lit@@ any on corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry .
the Court found that Rah@@ man would have per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in a cy@@ ni@@ cal way &quot; and that he sil@@ enced his critics with rac@@ is@@ sm@@ us@@ - and Islam@@ opho@@ bia accus@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man is said to have led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 votes were either doubt@@ ful or the consequence of im@@ itation in which one person chooses to be someone else .
Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud in the whole country .
he expressed in particular al@@ arm@@ ingly to the frau@@ dul@@ ent choice of letters - in which older members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to elect a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including guiding clu@@ es to prove the identity
&quot; &quot; &quot; in his report it says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; evidence was placed that pressure was exer@@ ted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities , especially women and young people , to choose according to the will of elders , in particular communities with Pakistan or b@@ ang@@ la@@ din backgrounds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that ... State institutions have deliberately ignored such behaviour due to &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over@@ sensitivity concerning eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric advised 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the prohibition that political activists edit letters in@@ discrimin@@ ately in order to stop &quot; election harvesting . &quot;
the report , considered by Ther@@ esa May , requires tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the electoral directory being used for immigration and social security purposes .
consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID .
do not use removable ink on a person &apos;s finger as soon as she has left her voice to prevent someone sel@@ ects twice .
systematic reviews on the nationality of a person to ensure that they are optional .
a three year limitation on applications for automatic brief@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; prohibition that political activists edit full post@@ elections and envel@@ op@@ es of let@@ ter@@ elections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police have authority to set out barriers to election centres .
a change of law that facilitates an indictment for intim@@ id@@ ation in accordance with the &apos; Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 .
freedom of photography in election centres .
requirement that only English can be used in the voting stations ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that employees usually enforce that voters go alone in the electoral cab .
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after Tower Ham@@ lets case there was no complaint .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Elec@@ toral Court has declared Lut@@ sk Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices un@@ fit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was found guilty for a number of reasons - in accordance with the stringent requirements in the criminal proceedings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check checks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the election registration departments of the town halls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court judgement in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our country is a proud heritage as the mother of the parliam@@ ents , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spread of election fraud and den@@ ial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation .
crazy to K@@ ate Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gän@@ ger and other famous Doppel@@ gän@@ gers from Olympi@@ as@@ port@@ lern in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio have come across the French wheel sports@@ woman Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ PRE@@ VO@@ T , apart from the border and the band , who proved to be an impressive double @-@ worker of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympi@@ oni@@ x is by far not the only ath@@ lete to fight gold , who has his own famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger - at least not if one is allowed to believe the social media faith .
in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that fli@@ cker at the time on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympic games that have more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties .
the h@@ unter and the wolf : team member of the U.S. team in Arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son , left , has been compared with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio since childhood
besides K@@ ate &apos;s Doppel@@ gän@@ ger on the racing track , many people on the internet pointed out how a certain ar@@ cher of the twin from A @-@ Pro@@ mi could be Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio .
the team member of the U.S. team in Arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son has caused a rush on Twitter after pictures on which he sees the Wolf of Wall Street Star un@@ cover@@ tly .
in fact , the ar@@ cher got the ma@@ dness in the social media and admitted that he has already heard from his childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; I see no great simil@@ arity with the exception of the facial hair , &quot; Bra@@ dy told the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a good @-@ looking guy , so I guess I &apos;ll be compli@@ mented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focal point : the striking simil@@ arity between the British female jum@@ per Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
the Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Must@@ afa , with her large expressive eyes , is supposed to go through as a doubles @-@ fle@@ as for the Cub@@ an @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool , the South African swi@@ mmer Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one course higher : this user believes that Nathan is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
another ongoing comparison was drawn between the tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ mut , who has similar heavy ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian Silver medal @-@ s@@ wimm@@ ers Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ f@@ im@@ ova points more than just the sun @-@ tann@@ ed skin and bl@@ ond hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while American Nathan Adrian was attacked by fans , an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar facial shape and eyes
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others have noticed the simil@@ arities .
theory in the room : according to this user there may be perhaps one reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter user explained her satisfaction that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the internet thinks that Hope Solo and J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the U.S. football star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar face shape and eyes .
other popular compar@@ isons covered K@@ err@@ i Wal@@ sh J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney and the gold medal winner in the gymn@@ ast Gab@@ by Douglas , who has her own beautiful , wide smile that resembles that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .
C@@ BC @-@ comment@@ ator for the Olympic Games exc@@ uses for his statement that Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers &quot; died like a pig &quot;
B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds analysis over the fourth place of 14 @-@ year @-@ old Ai Yan@@ han at d@@ r 4x@@ 200m Fran@@ con@@ cre@@ aked viewers of the C@@ BC live transmission of the Ol@@ m@@ yp@@ ical games on Wednesday
Canadian broad@@ ca@@ ster C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese flo@@ ats &quot; like &quot; dropped off &quot; and during the race like &quot; a pig died . &quot;
the comment@@ ator B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was switched off when he made his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 100m free @-@ nurse squ@@ ad@@ ron .
Mac@@ Donald who was brought aboard the C@@ BS &quot; team of comment@@ ators to give more &quot; colour &quot; could be heard say : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese woman has lost the union , baby . &quot;
getting too excited , went off like a pig , died like a pig .
thank you for this .
the Chinese flo@@ ater Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the floating squ@@ ad@@ ron 1 : 5@@ 7,@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor rope , which allowed Can@@ adi@@ ans to close the gap to China .
audience in all Canada responded quickly online after they were shocked by the sound and the language
Em@@ met@@ t Mac@@ far@@ my@@ elin twe@@ et@@ ed , &quot; H@@ as the C@@ BC @-@ Com@@ ment@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Flo@@ wers from China &quot; died like a pig . &quot; ? ? ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idi@@ ot didn &apos;t get that they were still on show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ai Yan@@ han from China was described in the final 4 x 200 free @-@ style floating squ@@ ad@@ ron for women as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese woman has lost the connection , baby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cri@@ tique of B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ don@@ ald on Twitter was quick and hard at which many asked him to speak .
Twitter users did not get back when they heard how in@@ sensitive B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Donald was
another Twitter user in Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald .
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and let us all look like ra@@ cists . # disgu@@ sted .
short time later , Scott Russ@@ el , who moder@@ ated the C@@ BC broadcast , presented live for the comment of Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze that the comment was broadcast over a swimming capacity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was an un@@ fortunate wording , we are sorry that it happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed for more than 90 times in people who responded to the B@@ emer@@ le about Twitter
Scott Russ@@ el &apos;s fellow @-@ mate had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze in the name of Mac@@ Donald .
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ology to more than 90 other Twitter users compl@@ aining about Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and issued a message .
we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible for them to be broadcast .
yesterday night we ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our viewers on show and our folklore in the social media .
to clarify one , B@@ yr@@ on &apos;s comments related to the performance of s@@ wimm@@ ers rather than on them as a person .
nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ happy formulation . B@@ yr@@ on does what he said , very sorry .
on Thursday , Mac@@ Donald sincer@@ ely ap@@ ologi@@ zed to the broadcast and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the female squ@@ ad@@ ron in the C@@ BC Olympics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I referred to the performance of the swi@@ mmer and not to her as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , no cont@@ emp@@ t was intended and I am very sorry . &quot;
buyer in Pri@@ mark ou@@ tra@@ ged about woman , who ta@@ sted in the middle of business sham@@ elessly under@@ wear
the buyers did not know where to go , when a woman pulled out her clothes in the middle of a pri@@ mar@@ row to try pants .
in order to wor@@ sen the situation , she scrut@@ ini@@ zed her as she looked at it , pulled it out and put her back into the shelf .
she continued to browse and ta@@ sted four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping mall in Folk@@ estone .
the Pri@@ mark shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping centre in Folk@@ estone where the woman ta@@ sted the under@@ pants before she put her back into the shelf
a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ d@@ son , who was in business at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ wear , she went on and left business without buying anything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The people could not believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
standing in the middle of the show@@ room she took a pair of under@@ pants from the delivery , pulled out her own stock@@ ing trousers and pants and ta@@ sted her .
&quot; she didn &apos;t even tried to find a more discreet place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone star@@ ed when she pulled out the pants which you obviously did not like , as she put her back on the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same with three more under@@ pants before she finally decided that she didn &apos;t like her , pulled out again and went out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b anyone watching someone - or thinking about the person who would perhaps buy the pants that she had tried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; MS Davi@@ d@@ son , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how disgu@@ sting to think that someone would take under@@ pants with someone who had another person and who were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident happened on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. Davi@@ d@@ son added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I have received , the staff tries to draw the clothes from the sale after it went - which is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and find out that another woman had touched her and pulled out and she was not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident which occurred on Tuesday 9 August at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

how to protect yourself from weapons attacks using Kra@@ v Mag@@ a
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video from Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a bit more secure for you .
we spoke with Rh@@ on Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at close distance .
regardless of whether you are approaching you from the front or from behind , this video will show you how to turn the sk@@ ewer against your pre@@ dat@@ or .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when approaching you from behind , you should turn around as first , so that you can see your att@@ acker and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; go out of the line , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then grab the weapon between your for@@ ear@@ m and your shoulder before you face it with your free ell@@ bow .
beat him then with his knee in the bar and twist , while the aggres@@ sor jumps out of pain , the weapon out of his hands . beat him with the run into the face and move backwards as they set the weapon on him .
when att@@ ack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the gun line , grab the gun and twist it , so that the att@@ acker can &apos;t shoot .
shift the weight on the gun at the same time and beat the att@@ acker to the chest , then turn the gun out of its grip before moving backwards and set the weapon on it .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how Miz@@ ra@@ chi is doing .
but remember that a rob@@ ber@@ y is the saf@@ est to hand over your money if you are not a Grand Master &apos;s Kra@@ v .
traveler Ian W@@ right ab@@ bot for a guide his tongue at the dir@@ ti@@ est places in Europe
a British trav@@ eller under@@ took his immune system and thro@@ ws a serious test by le@@ aking some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
the moder@@ ator and travel author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k threw his train on a euro note , a rail@@ ing at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a flus@@ hing button on a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance of his immune system .
before the mat@@ ing of each object he used an L@@ umin@@ ometer to show himself and to us what he is going to get involved .
but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results to daylight .
the thought of rej@@ ecting the flus@@ hing button of a train toilet that has been used by thousands of others may be totally repell@@ ent , but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink .
on his journey through Europe Mr. W@@ right spoke with doctors and medical specialists on the promotion of gut bacteria as well as about his own health .
fortunately nothing left what he li@@ cked out , more than a bad after@@ taste in his mouth .
Mr. W@@ right became known to test the resili@@ ence of his bow@@ el by travelling through the world and eating unique and wonderful things .
from public rail@@ roads to train stations to r@@ ins@@ ing buttons of toilets , the task definitely put its immune system under one sample
in the film he told , &quot; As a child , I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things into my mouth , earth , worms and slu@@ dge water . &quot;
in the film he was definitely justified by his reputation .
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his sample painting showed a lumin@@ ance of more than 4000 units .
in comparison to this , the L@@ umin@@ ometer number of freshly washed hands is less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet he refused to refuse , after having had a lumin@@ ance of more than 4000 units , while freshly washed hands were less than 60 .
Mr. W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this comes close to the worst thing I spoke in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing more dirty than that !
I will not lick here because it is disgu@@ sting here .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company equi@@ ps Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D in order to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune system .
vali@@ os Senior Venice President for Snacks , juices and new categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we really wanted to offer consumers something new .
something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of pro@@ bio@@ tics .
we conducted crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming , ending that we said &quot; Let &apos;s call Ian . &quot;
they claim that the interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of gut health and how it is linked with the immune system .
the growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of hum@@ our !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who directed the movie , added : &quot; let me say - I would have lost my respect for Ian , if he had ta@@ sted some of the things I had instructed him to lick , just like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet that is shown in the film . &quot;
of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to check them out and others where it was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad that we recorded some of these dirty treats on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o from 2015 84 percent of all sur@@ vey@@ ed lac@@ tic acid bacteria associated with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said that they may at least occasionally use products containing lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
as@@ o@@ zi@@ ale family destroyed before del@@ o@@ gi@@ zing social housing in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
an as@@ o@@ ci@@ ale family left her social housing after a del@@ o@@ gi@@ zation with a loss of £ 50,000 because she had terrori@@ zed her neighbors .
T@@ anya Skel@@ by and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
once they were forci@@ bly removed from their property , the housing cooperative &apos;s employees found the property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition .
the walls had cla@@ p holes , wooden plan@@ ks were torn up , tr@@ ash was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubric@@ ated to the walls .
the family was reloc@@ ated and it is assumed that she is now living in a private accommodation
Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ vo@@ y , who works for the home administration of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that she was afraid that the apartment was no longer repaired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was a night@@ mare for the people here and I think that people don &apos;t have to live this way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider as this property is thought to be considered not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and its reputation is also not@@ orious .
the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment meanwhile and the police said that the terror that the family had inflic@@ ted on street fights with bas@@ eball bats , intim@@ id@@ ation of residents , drug abuse , drug traffi@@ cking and excessive crying , stri@@ kers and cur@@ ses .
Skel@@ by , 47 , whose name was on the lease , was given an arrangement for anti @-@ social behaviour in June .
in some rooms of the house , which may be torn down under certain circumstances , old rub@@ b@@ ish was found
in the estate where drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wooden plan@@ ks were torn up .
neighbours said they had to fight them on the street and inv@@ oked the police on a regular basis .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing drove her and her partner by force this week by forci@@ bly from the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer .
the delegates were che@@ ered by facilit@@ ated neighbours who said that their life was made to Hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They didn &apos;t care about anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years next to them and it was always bad .
the countless times we have to say the police here are incredible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this morning we couldn &apos;t sleep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it !
now , where they are finally gone , it will become beautiful .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that the family had agreed to cooperate with local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years .
on the over@@ grown side of the church house garbage and old toys were dump@@ ed
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ant agreed to accept any responsibility for their behavior and their family , as a del@@ o@@ gi@@ zation is always the last step considering the Corn@@ wall housing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was a very difficult case , because the behavior was extreme and their actions for their neighbours had to be terrible .
I appreciate all the work that my team , the De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police and members of the community who have courage@@ ously approached us and have given us the information .
I hope this development will give comfort to some neighbours and the message conve@@ ys that anti @-@ social behaviour will not be tolerated .
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 .
a dirty mattress , which is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after del@@ o@@ ving on the floor
workers of the property administration will now have to clean garbage cans that surround the house
in 2014 the police conducted a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g cannabis as well as balances , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ by received a fine after having found itself guilty of the possession of a drug of class B in commercial intent .
she claimed that the money was a grav@@ estone of her son Lee Skel@@ by , who died in 2013 in a car accident .
after they were homeless , T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh .
many of the rooms of the house were gra@@ ci@@ ously gra@@ ded with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police says they will deleg@@ ate ten@@ ants who do not abide by the house rules
the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall told Angela C@@ row that del@@ o@@ gi@@ zing was a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants who do not stick to the house rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think they can act without self @-@ reproach and those who have been har@@ med by such behaviour , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behavior that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
tourists in Portugal disp@@ at@@ ched after a ph@@ asing military jet over@@ flies the beach
sun worship in Av@@ eiro , Portugal survived the shock of her life
a portu@@ guese P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on plane of the air force forces put an incredible pl@@ ough
the air forces stated that it was on a training flight but insist@@ ed that no security risk was present
this was the moment when frigh@@ tened tourists start to panic after a ph@@ asing jet over@@ comes across a full beach .
dramatic video footage shows how the military aircraft flew close to the beach in Av@@ eiro in northern Portugal almost within reach .
the vac@@ ation@@ ers jump@@ ed up , as they understand@@ ably started to worry about the noise of the jet engines , without first seeing what came to them through the clouds .
the incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ers who posted videos about the dramatic Fly @-@ By in the social media , said : &quot; it flew twice really very deeply and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane would drop down on me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists at the beach of Av@@ eiro were in panic when the plane came out of the darkness and incredibly low .
the Portuguese Air Force today announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on plane was on a training flight to identify fis@@ her boats off the coast and had to fly so deeply that this was the only way to recognize them .
the speaker told us that due to the poor visibility , the air@@ planes flew a little deeper than usual , but the air forces insist@@ ed that security was at no time at risk .
area fires destroyed those summer parts of the Portuguese mainland where four people died on Madeira Island .
the Portuguese Air Force today announced that the pilot had to fly so deeply because of the conditions - strong fog and smoke smoke - which limits his vision
the plane was on a training flight in which the pilot had to identify fis@@ her boats as part of the exercise
Super@@ cup : Bar@@ ca with worry about Sev@@ ille
Sevilla - The FC Barcelona fights for the first title win in the new soccer season on Sunday .
the Catal@@ ans compete in the du@@ el around the Spanish Super@@ cup against FC Sevilla , the back@@ lash three days later in Camp No@@ u .
the Dou@@ ble@@ winner must refrain from competing with the superior C@@ up@@ fin@@ alist and reig@@ ning European @-@ League Champion amongst others on N@@ ey@@ mar , who cont@@ ests the Olympic football tournament with Brazil .
in addition , there is also a lack of Marc @-@ Andr@@ e ter St@@ egen .
the German suffered a change in the knee in the training , which clari@@ fied the demand for Bar@@ ca at least for the time being in favor of Claudio Bra@@ vo .
the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er St@@ egen are competitive in Barcelona for two years now .
in this respect , Coach Luis En@@ rique refra@@ ined from making a clear decision and left Bra@@ vo in the league , but in most other applicants T@@ er St@@ egen had the advantage .
before the first match of the new season , the Spanish master doubts about the fitness level of the team , which was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game from Liverpool with 0 : 4 .
also at 3 : 2 at the pro@@ pon@@ t@@ ance against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday , Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. did not really know how to convince them .
Sevilla in turn has the 2 : 3 defeat after an extension in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid and aims at the second triumph at the &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana . &quot;
with so far , Barcelona is the record winner of this race .
Ma Long in a separate league table tennis @-@ gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic champion .
the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his comp@@ atri@@ ot and &quot; title defender &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro .
thus the World Ranking Celeb@@ rate won the &quot; Golden Grand S@@ lam &quot; with success at the World Cup , World Cup , World Tour Fin@@ als Tournam@@ ent and Olympia .
bronze went to Japanese Ju@@ n Mi@@ zut@@ ani .
the two Chinese made it into the final game as expected and made the title among themselves .
thus it was clear that for the third time a Chinese would fetch the single title in the sign of the Five R@@ ings .
last non @-@ Chinese at the top Olympic podium was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö legi@@ on@@ ary Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the record , between the sentences and time @-@ outs they had no coaches .
they had gone back to the grand@@ stand and left their cont@@ ests in fair competition alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I played the matches here for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the finale I play for myself , &quot; Z@@ hang said lo@@ gically .
after the game gold and silver med@@ alli@@ sts posed with the China flag .
the match itself was un@@ expect@@ edly one @-@ sided .
Ma had really to fight with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent only in the first movement .
after that he set the pace on the record and left Z@@ hang from there only a total of 13 points .
due to the superi@@ ority of Ma , not the expected ro@@ using match developed .
but nevertheless , there was enough breath taking breath taking place .
Mi@@ ckey won the game of bronze against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
in his quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als against the German champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the white @-@ rus@@ se had suffered a ri@@ b injury , after that in medical treatment , &quot; ultimately &quot; had to be content with sheet metal .
by the way , the Swe@@ des Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Per@@ sson ( 42 / 2008 ) were in similar high table tennis @-@ old Olympia @-@ Vi@@ erte .
Donald Tru@@ mp ad@@ mits &quot; huge problems ″ in the election campaign
the leadership of the US rep@@ ublic@@ ans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in traditional conservative states to lose their majority .
presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp has now acknowledged weaknesses of his election campaign in the former Republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ old U@@ tah .
a rare moment in which the usually large and self @-@ confident Mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ ary expressed as something as concerns , as correspon@@ dents reported .
having thrown 16 ri@@ vals out of the race in his own Republi@@ can camp , doubts about his success in the fight for the White House are now growing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have huge problems in U@@ tah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp of evangel@@ ical Christians , who asked for support in important states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
wrong@@ ly reports about his can@@ did@@ acy , he took up his famous media flock again .
w@@ ack@@ ling Republi@@ can High@@ lands
U@@ tah is usually a safe bank for the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
according to a survey conducted by Sur@@ vey@@ States in June , Tru@@ mp and his entin lay on the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton .
other institutes see tur@@ mp in front , but not with the distance that is common for Republi@@ can candidates in the federal state .
Arizona and Georgia are regarded as endangered .
in an interview with the channel CN@@ BC , Tru@@ mp answered the question of how he wanted to stop Clinton &apos;s advance : &quot; just as I have done so far . &quot;
and if behind : this will be either successful or I will make a very nice long vacation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he doesn &apos;t do anything other than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to tell the truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it did not suff@@ ice for him for reasons of political correctness , that was fine , Tru@@ mp continued .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the party of Tru@@ mp is said to have threatened to raise funds to support his election campaign , he should not be able to present a better result .
instead of this , the candidates of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans are trying to reach more under the arms for Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Olympia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; triple Sc@@ am on Dop@@ ing Test &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the IO@@ C wants to set up a disciplinary commission .
Ken@@ y@@ as athletes face the second dop@@ ing affair at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
after a fraud test during a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic village , Kenya sent a coach home .
the International Olympic Committee immediately agreed to set up a disciplinary committee to investigate the case .
a Ken@@ yan officials announced that the former spr@@ inter and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , gave a urine sample in the Olympic Village , under the name of the 800 @-@ metre runner , F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Ro@@ ti@@ ch .
this was reported to the Team Director of Kenya by the Dop@@ ing inspec@@ tors .
the IA@@ AF World Association has asked the IO@@ C for information about the case in order to ex@@ ert its own investigations , an IA@@ AF spokesperson .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures of the IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in an IA@@ AF explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the dop@@ ing control station and spent himself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Ro@@ tis@@ ch , gave up and signed the sample , &quot; said Kenya &apos;s boss de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i .
he was in possession of the accreditation of the ath@@ lete , who was on the list for training controls of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Ro@@ ti@@ ch has been over 800 meters in Beijing World Championship in 2015 .
four days earlier , the Ken@@ yan Ath@@ le@@ tics He@@ ath@@ lete Michael Ro@@ ti@@ ch was deduc@@ ted from the Rio Games .
he is said to have informed sport@@ spe@@ ople of his country about pending dop@@ ing tests .
according to media reports , he was reported to have been arrested at his return to Nairobi airport .
Kenya is already under special observation during the IO@@ C after numerous dop@@ ing processes .
in the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing target checks before the Rio Games , more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls before the Rio Games were previously advised that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia are targeted .
the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency had exer@@ ted a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil , to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was passed a few weeks before the Olympic start .
as a result , the WA@@ DA Kenya took from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control con@@ forms with the rules of WA@@ DA .
Kenya is considered a great runner nation .
the athletes of the country won most med@@ als at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
in a series of television reports on the ARD , accus@@ ations were repeatedly raised that dop@@ ing agents are easily accessible in Kenya and there should be a substantial ment@@ ality of sports dec@@ eption .
IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und finally called for a similar study to Kenya , as he had hired her in Russian athle@@ tics .
it has been proven that this type of sport has been systematically and systematically supp@@ ressed .
Russian athletes were then excluded from the summer games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Salzburg &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Shakespeare @-@ Jahr the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Mary as a tragic couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et .
with it a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Lie@@ uten@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ eins masterpiece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the artistic director Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and fulfilled a youth dream with the role of Mary .
in the orchestra pit , the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Symphony Orchestra led by the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gust@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he enth@@ uses .
we always say that it is very Latin @-@ American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and melody .
it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we have Bern@@ st@@ eins Music really in our blood !
in this staging Bart@@ oli plays an older Lady .
she reminds one of her love with Tony while the younger Mary is playing and dancing .
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
firstly because it is musi@@ cally unusual !
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
she says in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and bright . &quot;
so she is wise , naturally also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she resembles me very much , my Italian character , which I have as Roman in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is such an honour for us to work with her .
it is an enormously generous person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
one sees it in each of his movements , in his glan@@ ces , it is his life !
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temp@@ er , a fire , a passion and also a cheerful approach to life , which is very important at all !
&quot; &quot; &quot; for American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up to date : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this piece deals with prejudi@@ ce and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today we have the refugees , at that time the Pu@@ ert@@ ori@@ ans went to New York , and the New York residents didn &apos;t want them .
they are the same subjects , and they are as meaningful today as they were at that time .
59 years later this piece is still relevant .
London &apos;s school@@ girl who joined the IS was killed in Syria
K@@ adi@@ za sult@@ ana , one of three British girls leaving London last year to join the IS , re@@ port@@ edly died in Syria .
the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me A@@ kun@@ je@@ e said that her family had learned from her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a several weeks ago .
it was suspected that it was killed by a Russian air raid in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the group &apos;s bul@@ war@@ k in the country , reported I@@ TV news on Thursday .
Sult@@ ana was 17 years old and , according to her family , died shortly after she had planned to leave the war @-@ torn country and return to England .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one can only hope that the only good is - as a warning and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - to stop people from ever meeting this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ kun@@ je@@ e said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in February 2015 , Sult@@ ana and two other girls from the east of London went to a plane in the direction of Turkey , and then entered a bus to the Syrian border .
Sult@@ ana &apos;s family announced that she married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria , and within a few months she became a widow .
Rei@@ d says that in the case of an election victory in Gar@@ land , Clinton will remain as candidates for the Supreme Court .
Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s presidential candidate will nom@@ inate the Justice Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court .
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in the Senate have blocked Gar@@ land &apos;s confirmation since his nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Conn@@ ell believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the late Jud@@ ge at the Supreme Court of Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that Clinton expected to select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a certain degree of certainty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of Rei@@ d said later that he had not talked to Clinton if she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ulates .
he praised Gar@@ land and said that Clinton &apos;s team would not worry about rest@@ lessness with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the Supreme Court of the United States Court of Appe@@ al for the District of Columbia .
RAID said Rep@@ ublic@@ ans blocked the Gar@@ lands nom@@ ination , were lack@@ eys and hel@@ pers of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp .

the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us early this year that his nude magazine features old@@ school play@@ boys , as &quot; Play@@ boy is for men . &quot;
I do this for women .
apparently he believes that the calendar is also doing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to return to portra@@ yal of timeless and classic nu@@ dity , in which both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sha@@ w in a press release for the release of the calendar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art .
models can submit their images online or in person at open casting calls in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish community counts with mass exo@@ dus
&quot; anyone who doesn &apos;t fit and Erd@@ og@@ an lo@@ oses , sits on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ nearby Foundation Di@@ alogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un .
the Kur@@ ds in Germany reck@@ ons on short term with tens of thousands of refugees escap@@ ing from Turkey to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the medium term , it could even be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few hundred thousand &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; believed the president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of the hard advance of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an after the coup attempt , the Kur@@ ds in Germany expect a mass flight to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at short notice I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term with a few hundred thousand pat@@ rons from Turkey in Germany , when the Erd@@ og@@ an regime further comb@@ ats the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the chairman Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because the government had already delivered Kurdish stron@@ gh@@ olds with pen@@ alties several months ago , there were 500@@ ,000 Kur@@ ds in Turkey on the run .
after the failed put@@ sch , secular and op@@ posi@@ tional eth@@ ni@@ cal Turks would be added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many will want to restart in Europe if they are supp@@ ressed in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state that takes up refugees itself , produces refugees in their own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chief of the Association compl@@ ained the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in al@@ evi@@ c cities .
with this , Erd@@ og@@ an wants to increase the expression on the remaining Kur@@ ds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last major minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have been exter@@ min@@ ated or displaced in the past hundred years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Chief of the Union demanded that the federal government positions itself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as sharp as Austria against Erd@@ og@@ an and his supporters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany , too , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; witch hunt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Erd@@ og@@ an critics is taking place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
more Turks are looking for asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists .
the br@@ anding as Gü@@ len Tra@@ iler destro@@ ys teachers and other academ@@ ics professional existence .
&quot; whoever does not adapt to Erd@@ og@@ an is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , by the way also the c@@ em@@ alists and sa@@ vi@@ sts , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ nearby Stiftung Dialog and Education , the &quot; World . &quot;
as the newspaper reports on figures of the Federal Ministry of the Interior , the Turks have already presented the largest group of asylum seek@@ ers recognised by political persecution in Germany before the coup .
as of June 30 , this has been 11.@@ 3@@ 86 people and there@@ with almost 29 percent of all An@@ not@@ ees ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
in this survey , there is no fear of war , poverty or a lack of prospects .
asylum seek@@ ers under the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from the state side , individually persecuted .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; go where it hur@@ ts &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals do not get anything from the summer campaign - and the holi@@ day@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to choose the Land@@ tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2021 , the Parliament elections will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays , the parliament &apos;s parliament decided already at the beginning of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for more stupid than so far it is not : summer holidays , heat and land elections - this bites .
the locals , who are to be persu@@ aded by the elec@@ tive fighters , are on vacation .
most of the vac@@ ation@@ ers who are in the countryside , on the island of Use@@ dom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are not natives , so must not choose the Land@@ tag .
there are practical problems : during the holidays , hel@@ pers , posters hang up , infl@@ ate ballo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ yers and cast votes in the end , only te@@ h up with difficulty .
until the 4th of September 2016 , the election and last holiday day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to pass an election campaign just over the people .
the hot phase , if you can say that at all , has just begun .
and it &apos;s also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , Leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must be worried about his office .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U in surveys .
what is exciting is how strong newcom@@ er Af@@ D cuts and what remains at the end of coalition @-@ proof .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and head of government since 2008 , makes an almost in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous election campaign , one sees from his big posters .
he travels across the country , distri@@ butes ro@@ ses and chat@@ ting a little with the people , just as his legendary elo@@ qu@@ ent predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff had done .
otherwise , seaf@@ ar@@ ers have got cold feet and chan@@ cell@@ or Merkel blame for the blossom@@ ing of Af@@ D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their refugee policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create this &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; ha@@ st@@ ened the rise of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the beautiful ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U with its top candidate , the Minister of the Interior , Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when you are at the right place at the wrong time .
she has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to major explor@@ ations ; the German Chancellor Angela Merkel is located in the north @-@ east .
but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority in other federal states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania , recently in the N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it &apos;s a pity for anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once .
apart from that , the Nord@@ ost @-@ CD@@ U disp@@ enses with the usual election campaigns on market@@ places and in front of shopping m@@ alls with umbrellas and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that , according to Kok@@ ert , plays only a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; subordin@@ ate role &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Union has also noted that in the country you have to remove the base that it has to work very hard to find a wire to the people again .
it is like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : barely present in the expan@@ se of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Council of the CD@@ U vot@@ er Kok@@ ert on his comrades is self @-@ revealing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have to go where it hur@@ ts , namely where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ les , Golden weddings , every birthday party has to be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because much is at stake , Sell@@ ering has now called his SPD a particularly committed campaign .
in surveys compl@@ ying with 22 per cent behind partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just under Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
at the 2011 election , the SPD had still clearly gained 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
the Gre@@ ens , the small party with seven percent in the poll@@ s , are likely to make the leap into the Parliament .
they make a modern virtue out of holiday poverty and largely transfer their election campaign to the internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online election campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it calls the president of the state Claudia Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
otherwise , green elec@@ tive fighters go on search for traces of indigenous voices among holi@@ day@@ makers .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , just cur@@ es with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg lakes and finds it also beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their impression : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; electoral holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ Rest@@ oration : restaurants suffer from block@@ age
there is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ itated .
for those responsible for the construction work that begin at 5.@@ 30@@ am and end only around 8@@ pm , there is everywhere praise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did everything rather cris@@ p , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the jet fuel station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a Super@@ Team .
there is no delay .
at the beginning of the week , the construction site could be reloc@@ ated to the south at the beginning of the week , until the end of October everything should be ready .
the opposite will also be praised for those responsible for construction work , for example when it comes to setting up residence permits .
since the construction site on Monday moved south and also the barrier of the asphalt road in O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen has been lifted and the connection to Rot@@ tenburg continues , the traffic situation within the town is relaxed .
the citizens can now proceed on both sides by O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 .
the pass traffic through the place seems to go back .
&quot; there were some considerable dis@@ comforts , &quot; says the deputy chief manager Florian King responsible for the maintenance @-@ related management of the rehabilitation .
the residents of Bach@@ lin@@ straße , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many routes were looking for and more familiar with their Nav@@ i than the signs .
what led to the fact that some trucks spread in residential areas .
as the speed limit@@ ers were not comp@@ lied with , the community stepped up the boat from M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were considerable ri@@ ots , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says King , who made himself aware of the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two to three per minute have already been heated .
the fastest was on the way with 77 km kilometres in the Tempo @-@ 30 zone .
since the construction site has moved on , it has become cal@@ mer .
for the business people at the B 27 it is only a little con@@ sol@@ ation that the road again is open for customers from Rot@@ tenburg .
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
however , the fact that the B 27 re@@ development has led to sales collap@@ ses allows everyone to look through .
however some more and some are less affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who have less to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end customer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are therefore produced for other companies , for whom the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; even at the car deal@@ er@@ ship Ma@@ ier Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maximum slight drop &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but also ad@@ mits that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the running documents are missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most powerful are the local streets along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , propriet@@ or of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly Crown , finds clear words .
this is exist@@ ential threatening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; not only him , but all the restaurants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hit hard &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil were missing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to be happy about every euro turnover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the revenue pen@@ alties amount to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far more than 50 percent &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; street renovation has thrown back its operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he had to release half of his staff .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed , politics would have re@@ acted differently .
instead , government president Jörg Schmidt on a request by G@@ öh@@ ner said if there could be a financial compensation , the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation on the B 27 . now they must also bear the disadvantages arising from the rehabilitation .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows of other rural districts , where something more generous has been handled .
with all complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is certain that his restaurant will continue to exist .
after all , the family business has been settled here since 17@@ 15 , and refers to the long history .
he can understand that other regular guests now look less frequently because of the complicated routes of traffic .
if you cannot get there , it is also beautiful elsewhere .
he has no doubt that his family clientele came back to the end of the rehabilitation work .
despite the crises with BSE and avian flu , G@@ öh@@ ner considers the effects of the B 27 construction on his clients for the biggest crisis that his restaurant has experienced in its long @-@ standing history .
construction work for six months , this is already brutal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is constantly being bol@@ ted in the name of counter @-@ terrorism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the latest attacks , Interior Minister De Ma@@ izi@@ ère now presents a thick security package .
but what has a status of debt to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say about all this ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gives the Com@@ promis@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically acceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the coalition partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Federal Minister of the Interior in presenting his new security package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they don &apos;t over@@ charge anyone .
other , more advanced points would initially be discussed within the parties .
also , I took part in it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , as Minister of the Interior , he is located at results and at a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; achiev@@ able consensus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère has had a little time to pass before he presents his conclusions for the security in the Republic .
but they are all the more extensive .
some things have already been announced , announced , announced , that a new security authority in order to take care of the cra@@ p of encrypted communication is not new .
it is also not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU regulations on passenger data and weapons law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security authorities is not surprising as well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in part , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère starts a second run for proposals which have not yet been made with the SPD : he wants to put sympathy for terror groups under penalty and kno@@ ck the jihadi@@ sts with dual citizenship to the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ad@@ mits the CD@@ U man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he still considers this to be reasonable and does not demand anything that has no chances in the coalition partner anyway .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère also presents a few new ideas .
some of them have it in themselves : he plans rapid procedures for deport@@ ations and more opportunities for det@@ ecting people from deportation .
refugees who are targeted to the country should check their smartphone in advance and disclose social media accounts for a security check .
in the case of bul@@ ations for rejected asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to make some even worse - such as those who commit crimes or consciously throw away their papers in order to disgu@@ ise their identity .
some of them are politically and judi@@ ci@@ ary .
some of them are still un@@ wi@@ ped and leave questions un@@ answered .
and at some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of patients for example - the question arises : what does this actually have to do with security and terror ?
yes , says de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the subjects of refugees and terror .
but it cannot be questioned that the residents of Ans@@ bach and Wu@@ erz@@ burg were refugees .
in addition , in view of the high number of refugees , many people were worried about security .
and things that people pro@@ found@@ ly dealt with could not be excluded even in election times .
the inner security is simply shifted into the focus .
first the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Wu@@ erz@@ burg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
and yes , there are electoral campaigns .
Union and the SPD are increasingly in position on the issue of internal security .
in the past few days , the two parties went up .
only a gar@@ gan@@ tly dispute about the equipment of the Federal Police , then a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons interior ministers , in which the department chiefs also demand a Bur@@ m@@ ka prohibition and a revers@@ al of dual citizenship .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is also struggling here for irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able sounds .
he has nothing of a return from the double pass .
we have ended the discussion in Germany .
to re@@ plen@@ ish them is not sensible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and with a ban on bur@@ q@@ a he has constitutional obj@@ ections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether his own package is un@@ constitutional and whether it is actually &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reasonable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the coalition partner , has to show itself only . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there &apos;s a lot in what argument could be concerned about .
but the SPD is currently attempting to profile itself on the issue of internal security .
&quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further increase security . &quot;
still Volkswagen got off lightly .
despite diesel scar@@ ves , the delivery numbers worldwide increase .
but not in all markets it runs round .
there are vor@@ tices around a term in the call @-@ back campaign .
Volkswagen initi@@ ates deliveries in the second half of the year .
in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ running markets , Europe &apos;s biggest car battery can continue to show a plus thanks to its many brands and some well @-@ running markets .
but in July , the core brand VW was weak@@ ening mainly in Western Europe and thus loaded the total sales again as the company announced in the D@@ ax .
worldwide , the VW brand in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars sold 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year .
in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent lower than the previous year .
in the home market Germany , deliveries decreased by almost a sixth .
sales manager Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann returned the weaker figures of July mainly to two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , there has been a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed economic environment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in some core markets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , too , the British vote on exit from the EU said a spokes@@ woman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the United States , where the exhaust gas sc@@ at@@ ters first escal@@ ated , a minus continues to be recorded .
great support for VW is the Chinese market .
overall , the mainly affected brand of the Lower Saxony reports further lightly by the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , only an ex@@ tradition minus 0.@@ 9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles is now available .
group sales , Fred Kap@@ pler , was able to advance a sale of sales from January to July .
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles this time , 5,@@ 9@@ 04 million worldwide .
Volkswagen was able to manipul@@ ate gas tests with a software .
in Germany alone VW is calling some 2.5 million vehicles for retro@@ fitting into the workshops .
in the course of the conversion , VW re@@ affir@@ med that the conversion of cars had no negative effects .
after retro@@ fitting the vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the car battery ordered a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certificate after retro@@ fitting but not talking about a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as was stated on Friday in corporate travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason for this is legal sub@@ t@@ le@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reported that Volkswagen is now granting its German customers a guarantee for sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this would have confirmed Volkswagen representatives at the Federal Ministry of Transport last Monday .
it was confirmed by the Ministry of Transport that there was this meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has to fully comply with the requirements of my inquiry commission and KBA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deviations from this are not accepted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
VW has assumed the guarantee that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power after ref@@ itting no deterior@@ ations take place and all type @-@ approved vehicle values remain unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not as it was in corporate travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the wide term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warranty &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility that for example , a half year after conversion , customers can come into a workshop half a year after conversion - and this could lead to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in customer interest , it is also important to avoid that any other damage that has nothing to do with the sc@@ andal will result in uncertainty as to possible warranty regulations as it was called . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , VW does not use the term &quot; warranty . &quot;
the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands criminal interest from rich savers in future - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; head of the Bank Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on sight deposit accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Association of German banks speaks of an individual case and does not see it as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ordinary savings would have to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not fear to pay for their austerity measures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deposit money over night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay their 0.@@ 4@@ percent penalty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from September on , the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund will charge the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund to deposits of more than EUR 100,000 to deposits or daily payments .
&quot; the first 100.000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 will cost 400 euros in the future , &quot; Paul said .
he has kept 40 million euros for a while , which could be lifted from one day to the other and which he could not utilize .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent of costs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Chief Financial Officer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t lay down for every million 4000 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost is now continued after the pol@@ lu@@ ter pays principle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; leaving the cash in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ aults would be far too dangerous : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve already experienced four ra@@ ids , I don &apos;t want the fifth ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Banking Officer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
most customers would have understanding and changing to other forms of investment .
few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Co@@ operative Association of Bavaria explained : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy causes considerable costs in all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to wear it alone is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economically feasible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management , credit cards or transfers .
the Thurin@@ gian Folk and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land with its Sk@@ at@@ bank branch 2014 had head@@ lines with penalty interest amounting to three million euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael K@@ em@@ mer , Chief Financial Officer of the Banking Union , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay nationwide charges for deposits , and the competition in Germany among banks and savings banks is much too strong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker said , at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a clientele that is endowed with wealth a little more luxuri@@ antly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be a problem for a small bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it &apos;s free of charge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
founded in 1911 , G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .

&quot; &quot; &quot; there are currently no other banks known to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ operative Association of Bavaria &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; who charge a tax rate for deposits of private customers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokesperson on Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the President of the Federal Association of German B@@ anks and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank ( Bv@@ R ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared at the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go into the negative for private customers is very , very high . &quot;
competition is hard , and it threat@@ ens the migration of investors to competition .
customers in Germany will not be pleased with this in the wide range .

before you rush to the comment section , under the pseud@@ onym of not Alle@@ gem@@ a &apos;s middle @-@ aged middle @-@ aged middle @-@ age with rough ins@@ ults , this statement deri@@ ves from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the much @-@ discussed re @-@ creation of vinyl records is not attributable to a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als who want to welcome the news of physical objects , but to be traced back to Mid@@ life no@@ stal@@ gia .
those who recently bought a record are all fores@@ ight according to the age between 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely group of buyers .
it is also not a hor@@ de by hob@@ by@@ ists - it has an emotional impact : older record buyers tend to keep their feelings for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but are the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
if this blog were a news report on TV , the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , a modest grey suit and smo@@ ked wild@@ ly before I stand , keep my hands and tell something absurd as : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so let &apos;s take a look at it .
even though the heart of Soh@@ o is slowly losing its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings where independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic plate specialty shops .
I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to switch off the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to assess their age and mood by observing .
Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , from Si@@ ster Ray ( number of data : two young women , three middle @-@ aged men ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( number of data : eight middle @-@ aged men , one woman , probably around the 20 ) , is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I guess already , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have about 3.000 or 4,000 s@@ labs .
these vinyl records , pic@@ tured above ( he sent me the snapshot by email , I didn &apos;t follow him home ) , the walls of his living room suffer .
the reason he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records he couldn &apos;t afford when they appeared and bought items he sold when he was young and broke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many things I buy are from the late 60 &apos;s , early &apos; 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I thought was too young to buy them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he agrees that those who buy records are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink too much .
this is my vice .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works with Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many clients , whom he meets , apply to You@@ Go@@ v profile .
he has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media team , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and are forced to buy their old records again .
from the conversations I have conducted , people usually have to get rid of their collection in the same way around the year 1998 or 1999 .
customers who once sold their records to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; he says .
this would explain the boom to revi@@ vals of a certain age .
but what about the supposed emotional significance of records ?
it only takes a few seconds to realize that record stores offer a cal@@ ming community of like @-@ minded people .
according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers contacted the cont@@ act@@ less payment system .
some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar gram@@ ophone envel@@ op@@ es , objects that evoke bli@@ ss@@ ful youth memories .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of con@@ sol@@ ation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the case with me as a collector and I think it is so with many people .
it is a simple way to deal mentally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like her social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an employee fle@@ es from a record pile . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey conducted by the IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people who bought a record last month have not yet listened .
the survey also found that 41 % have a record player that they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record have no record player .
at this time of the news report I would probably look very concerned as I smo@@ ked by a pile of Bos@@ sa nov@@ a compil@@ ations .
Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( number of data : three middle @-@ aged men ) has noticed a &quot; trop@@ hi@@ es aspect &quot; of the revival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; someone just came here recently and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t own a record player , but I would like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead record so I can put her into the shelf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens .
more productive , less musical .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have people who say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are younger people , not older ones who only slowly enter .
mo@@ p , which has devoted almost a whole floor to the records , has a colourful audience when I go in .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ age boys and middle @-@ aged girls .
even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the aforementioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts newest synthes@@ izer and sex@@ ier pop rather than experimental jazz made out of speakers - it is good to see such a diversity among customers .
none of them looks very lonely , but the mental trauma is hard to detect if you stand next to someone for 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around the store for a few minutes and considers the variety of plates available for sale .
she &apos;s doing a window @-@ window rather than buying a big shopping .
she doesn &apos;t deserve much , so collecting records isn &apos;t a real option , she says .
it costs a lot .
it &apos;s easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; it drives with a loving si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record enthusiasts : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I give the impression of mut@@ ing the jeans pockets , I watch a group of young girls who group for a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter are thinking about buying a crossover record player .
on the left is a staircase , a wall full of plates from Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
no one looks at them - maybe because they are purely decorative , some so far up that it is impossible to touch them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is pure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; panel art &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but considering that each attraction for these items means more money for the industry and some customers might send to the depths of Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to complain about .
it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , is also the one that is most used for luxury objects such as records .
even though my research showed that the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote , they om@@ it , at least in record shops in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors and record lover that exist in reality , record stores and online forums .
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
they don &apos;t spend their th@@ urs@@ day tomorrow with a stroll through record stores on Ber@@ wick Street and the sheets through plates , while avoiding the star@@ ing look of an unc@@ anny , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false Moder@@ ator hanging over the shoulders of bad middle @-@ aged men .

French Court re@@ jects proposal on demoli@@ tion of shops in the jungle of refugee camps
a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais where thousands of refugees live .
during a court hearing this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 provisional deals in which persons within the camp sell goods , from cigar@@ ettes to energy drinks , sell hair@@ dressing services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants .
the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places were to be pulled down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which would hold a fire and sanitary risk .
humanitarian groups shared the Court that businesses and restaurants were important , as free meals offered by the state @-@ supported union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp .
they also stated that the provisional shops and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who operate the 72 provisional deals , but admitted that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais were &quot; absolutely comprehensible . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than just people living in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places threatened by the fall was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café des Camp , which is char@@ itable and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes , as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0,000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids &quot; Café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the closure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be a catastrophe for these children , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two help organizations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the Jung@@ le Camp has increased to more than 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number even now - following a steep increase in newcom@@ ers during the summer .
despite the Olympic dis@@ appointment : Martin remains fierce
despite his dis@@ ap@@ pointing performance at the Olymp@@ ischer tim@@ eline , Rad@@ Prof@@ i Tony Martin doesn &apos;t want to get under him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I keep looking at the World Cup , stay confident and fight more , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 31 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on Thursday before he left Rio de Janeiro on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has no explanation for his mis@@ erable twel@@ fth place at the sugar lo@@ af .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be honest , it &apos;s hard to comment on the time driving of yesterday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he had to analyse in peace what reasons would have led to de@@ bac@@ le .
Martin really wanted to fight for the title at the World Cup in Qatar in October .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will look at everything we have changed in recent times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this also counts my position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the three @-@ time World Champion , who had lost at the 5@@ 4.5 km more than three minutes to Olympic Champion Fab@@ ian Canc@@ ell@@ ara ( Switzerland ) on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;

group increases with start @-@ up for live video games
watching other people watching video games is a giant - that &apos;s what Microsoft wants to benefit from .
the technology group bu@@ ys the start @-@ up be@@ am , which special@@ ises in this hobby .
Microsoft announced on Thursday how much money flows for the acquisition .
Be@@ am started off with his offer only in January and has already more than 100,000 users .
you can watch others while playing , but also grab yourself .
for example , they can give players missions and deliver enemies as well as provide equipment .
the Spiel@@ eri@@ ese Activ@@ ision Bli@@ zz@@ ard launches a new HD video service for the bo@@ oming world of e @-@ sport .
on the way to the global media event Facebook will help .
the advertising industry is already hor@@ red .
the start @-@ up staff , based in Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington , moved to Microsoft headquarters in Red@@ mond , California , as Be@@ am co @-@ founder and boss Matt Sal@@ sam@@ end@@ i announced .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
according to Microsoft , Be@@ am is integrated in the video game department on the Xbox console .
the live streaming market of video games is growing rapidly .
well @-@ known platforms are T@@ witch and YouTube gaming .
T@@ witch was bought by the online retailer Amazon in 2014 - for nearly one billion dollars .

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers have to adjust to the next generation of speed raz@@ ors : in different federal states , among others in H@@ esse and Brandenburg , new flash devices are tested , which should be particularly effective .
the Fut@@ ur@@ istic En@@ forcement Tra@@ ilers from Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used , for example , at accident places where it would be too dangerous for mobile measurement by the police .
for example , on motorway construction sites or to rehabil@@ itating bridges with temporary speed polishing , there is often no necessary infrastructure to provide a stationary bl@@ aker to ensure compliance with speed limit .
however , a permanently mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly .
the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : with un@@ interrupted measuring operation , its battery lasts five days , the case data is transmitted encrypted over a modem .
laser measurement technology enables all vehicles to be recorded at the same time across multiple tracks .
variable speed limit@@ ers as well as access pro@@ hibitions at time , lanes and vehicle class can also be monitored .
according to the manufacturer , the trailer can be moved by car with trailer hit@@ ch in the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art state .
in order that it is not simply st@@ owed , it is lowered in the measuring mode , so that the wheels in the arm@@ oured and by the way cast iron outer shell disappear .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the gl@@ itter from v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to Vit@@ ronic information in different federal states and is now also used .
foreign authorities also bl@@ amed with the new technology : recently , France has ordered 100 units , following an order of 150 pieces last year .
great Britain reco@@ vers silver in 7 @-@ year @-@ old rug@@ by after Fi@@ ji &apos;s master@@ class reco@@ vers gold
Britain &apos;s impressive performance at 7 @-@ day rug@@ by came in the final on Thursday night to an ab@@ rupt halt in the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were hit in the De@@ odoro Stadium in Rio with a result of 43 @-@ 7 .
Fi@@ ji provided a master class in the handling , side @-@ st@@ eppe , back @-@ back , line course and raw power to win gold - its first Olympic med@@ alist of any color .
the defeat was won by the not too bad winning price of the silver medal - Great Britain &apos;s fourth this day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ final on the same day , could fall back to them in the final .
but regardless of this , Fi@@ ji would have defeated a 15 @-@ man @-@ team in this form .
it could be a con@@ sol@@ ation for GB - but it probably won &apos;t - that at least a Brit@@ on tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is head coach Ben R@@ yan , former head of England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult path .
eight years ago they lost each game at the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens in R@@ yan .
here they only lost one .
this folder will hurt , but progress is amazing .
Fi@@ ji began wonderful and left the attacks of G@@ Bs for fun .
it felt for Captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co. as if you were running in driving buses . the World Series winners went 5 @-@ 0 to the top when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au fro@@ ze in the corner .
with only four minutes of playing , Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa added another attack from the right @-@ hand corner which he turned around .
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly touched the ball .
a h@@ amp@@ ant T@@ ackle from Mit@@ ch@@ ell hal@@ ted the mountain of man Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa to achieve a third goal , but it only stopped Fi@@ ji .
in the seventh minute contest j@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a in the right corner a touch down and there stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new one since the re @-@ whist@@ le and there was still more than one minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ ided by further weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the UK team and rus@@ hed up to the line to make a gate .
the transformation brought a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
it &apos;s like Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while GB has still been taught .
this is how it is .
GB maintained fundamental changes in half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova went through a brilliant intermediate play of Fi@@ ji .
Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game had long been in favor of the South Sea consul@@ s , whose fans che@@ ered flags and d@@ anced on the tri@@ b@@ une .
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ am put the icing on the cake with another try in the last seconds .
the whist@@ le sounded , the Fi@@ j@@ is embra@@ ced and GB ki@@ cked in the grass .
earlier on that day Fi@@ ji had defeated Japan in the semi @-@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and Great Britain pushed South Africa in a scar@@ ce semi @-@ fin@@ alist match of the race - Great Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks to the front in the first half , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke through the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a gate among the posts in the second half .
a brilliant late tac@@ kl@@ ing by Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team , guaranteed winning - and thus the silver medal .
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspir@@ es through battle with the trainer &apos;s cancer
there will be no more em@@ ot@@ inous gold than in these games and that wants to be called .
from the first stroke to the last , 220 hard p@@ ieve that enter history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even though there were only those who sat at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the Train@@ ers Robin Williams , was present when they rowed to the second Olympi@@ ag@@ old in the second without tax woman , the first women in the history of British sports who set such a benchmark .
their domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all , their 3@@ 9.@@ 6 un@@ beaten work , which is also unprecedented .
what we see are two brilliant ath@@ lets gli@@ ding over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the style of the trium@@ ph@@ al ge@@ ese .
behind every gold in rowing there is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who make the difference and it was no more instrumental than the coach who did not know if he would survive this day at all than he was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said he was ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer that is able to operate and that &apos;s what they did .
if you don &apos;t do that , it will spread everywhere .
it would have been a pretty terrible situation .
it changes a bit the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio thank@@ ed that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , which kept the inter@@ ruption to a minimum , if that was the right term at all in such circumstances .
I needed money , so I had to get better soon .
it was an incentive .
I was hospit@@ alized and ran around the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough .
this is how it begins .
rowing is already a challenge , but that makes it even bigger .
in the immedi@@ acy of victory , her first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a nerve wre@@ cking morning doing something more than usual , trying to process his own fears .
&quot; &quot; &quot; p@@ anning who served as captain in the Royal Arti@@ llery Regi@@ ment in a deployment in Afghanistan said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was an emotional wre@@ ck this week . that &apos;s a bit extreme , but it means so much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only repe@@ ats how much that means , how much I and Hel@@ en and also Robin worked .
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
without Robin we would be nobody , so a massive thank you to him . he &apos;s the best trainer in the world .
I couldn &apos;t have wished for a better person for training or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning did not lose any race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents were not able to keep up .
even over the last 500 metres , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to close , p@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were caught very at the moment .
Hel@@ en called &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important not to be carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we weren &apos;t looking to make something rab@@ bit .
we didn &apos;t want fire@@ works today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race what we did .
the couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about their future .
next week Glo@@ ver has to appear on a wedding , her own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that it was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
in London it took about six months to realize that I am an Olympic champion .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that feels so much better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for 31 years exemplary for clarity
&quot; &quot; &quot; the managing director of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öller , is reti@@ ring . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association is regarded as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavarian @-@ wide exemplary &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a small French drinking water purpose association as a model for the large water producers .
it meant that some time ago it was in the original sound of a contribution from the Bavarian Radio .
little later , the Wasser@@ forum of the Government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia stran@@ gled the con@@ federation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the work of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemplary &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rupert G@@ eller , who has been a member of the association for 31 years , stands behind all this for 28 years as Managing Director .
he was now retired at the age of 65 .
the drinking water purpose association of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group , based in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality of Breit@@ brunn , annually transports approximately 150@@ 000 cubic meters of water and supplies 32 villages and ham@@ lets with about 5@@ 500 inhabitants .
member municipalities are the congregations of Kirch@@ enstein , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ ach .
there are water supply contracts for other cities and municipalities .
the current chairman , Breit@@ brun@@ ner mayor Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , reminded that Rupert G@@ eller was appointed a water@@ man in 1985 and was appointed managing director of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband in 1988 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his duties have been very diverse and they stretched from water management and maintenance work on office and organization activities , budget@@ ing , fees and sub@@ missions to emergency operations on weekends , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chairman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as outstanding events she called the commissioning and inauguration of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , land purchases in the area of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation for farmers , the re@@ development of the high tanks ( 1999 ) , the re@@ purchase of a central computer control system ( 2004 ) and the re@@ development of water pipes .
there has been no stand@@ still and new additions have always been added , because water is the most important food and drinking water is the most important food .
in her lau@@ dation she praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers loyal , reliable and correct service over 31 years .
he used a lot of heart blood for his water purpose association and he lived in the water @-@ purpose association as if it were his own company .
a few weeks ago , as a true practitioner , he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group for nit@@ rate reduction in front of the Unter@@ fran@@ ken Water Forum .
for this he received a lot of recognition and praise .
Rupert G@@ eller , on his part , praised Water @-@ wart Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best water @-@ wart and he was a faithful boy .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
in his view he described the well structure and the restructuring of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband .
but the biggest challenge and the most difficult use were the rup@@ ture pit at the high container near Kirch@@ berg on a 3rd January .
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night , so that the villages could be supplied with water .
one can only maintain the supply of Neu@@ brunn only because one filled the high reservoir from P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses .
the management of the pot@@ able water purpose association was handed over to Daniel Stur@@ mer from Lau@@ ter who succ@@ eeds Rupert G@@ eller .

the perpetr@@ ator is on the run , after him become public prosec@@ uted .
now nationwide because Sven S. could be on the road with the car .
the man is about 1,80 meters tall , muscular , brown @-@ fired and has a bald .
meanwhile the police published a photo of him .
however , it is a few years old .
in the meantime , the man is wearing a bald .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still carry the weapon in himself , so the police .
who sees Sven S. should call 110 .
the police speak of a &quot; relationship . &quot;
the victim was born 1988 , the perpetr@@ ator in 1981 .
the competent police in Lü@@ beck first did not want to provide any information about the practice or the relationship between the perpetr@@ ators and victims ; however , it confirmed that a human being had been killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a killing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not saying any more at this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokesperson in Lü@@ beck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses a special assignment command@@ o ( SE@@ K ) was at the crime scene .
steel - Licht@@ blick for the German steel industry
the crisis @-@ torn and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains unaffected by additional costs in millions .
financial burdens dedicated to the industry from green electricity subsidies are from the table .
it remains in the release from the Renewable Energy Con@@ version to the existing plants for so @-@ called own electricity production in the German steel industry , said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really happy that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years of tough negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the European Commission therefore initially planned to ask the steel producers to use the gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption .
according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when the generators in the steel mills are replaced are an EEG lev@@ y of 20 percent .
but even these are not raised in the steel industry .
the IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission on its own electricity production .
thus the status quo of the current regulation is largely determined .
Gabriel &apos;s successful effort for the steel industry is of particular importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Steel is Future &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; this is a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more must follow &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in the reform of emissions legislation , climate and employment targets are to be weigh@@ ed down , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained IG Metall @-@ boss Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has been suffering from over@@ capacity and considerable price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008 .
last year the situation was ag@@ grav@@ ated further , when the world &apos;s largest producer country China threw massive steel on the world market due to the weak@@ ening domestic demand .
European manufacturers acc@@ use Chinese steel companies price dump@@ ing .
in the course of this spring , the situation has somewhat relaxed .
on the one hand , import duties imposed on import steel show effect , on the other hand the economic outlook has brigh@@ tened up in China .
it is unclear how sustain@@ ably the price @-@ up is .
the German industry leader Th@@ ys@@ senk@@ rupp stays cau@@ ti@@ ously on Thursday .
last but not least , the prices would have stagn@@ ated again .
the sector responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
last but not least Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp did not want to exclude closure of individual works .
at the end of 2015 , some 8@@ 6,000 people were employed in the German steel industry .
in July the German steel producers are cau@@ tious despite rising prices and increasing orders .
at 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year &apos;s month , as the Steel Federation ha@@ st@@ ened on Friday .
after a short increase in May , the quantity produced went back the second month in a row .
since the beginning of the year , production is two percent lower than the previous year &apos;s figure .
in the coming months , the association expects an improved order situation with a rising output .
community , spirit , health : singing does the sen@@ iors well
the singing has accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp her whole life : as a young girl she was in the school choir , she occupied the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a senior choir .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; singing moves me - emo@@ tionally and physically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she describes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and overall more alive , she says .
by the way , she does something good for her health and her mind .
because singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors right from several perspectives , says Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German senior league .
most sen@@ iors sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded people the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler .
through regular interaction , sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts .
social and family structures often dissolve in old age , a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to speak and organize , to be able to rely on the others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in a positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
for doing so , sen@@ iors train a deep and controlled respir@@ ation .
those who regularly demand their lungs get out of the pu@@ ff even in everyday life .
even if it is about getting the sound of the voice in old age , singing is an optimal hobby .
in older people , singing often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Federal Labour Association of Senior Ci@@ tiz@@ ens .
in the older generations , joint singing had a much higher priority , it was part of everyday life , both at school and in leisure , she explains .
L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or hearing of songs in older people w@@ akes many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth .
lyrics and special melodies are self @-@ restra@@ ined by dementia suffer@@ ers of long @-@ coming events .
in singing , the head also demands a special performance , L@@ enz declared .
at the same time focusing on one &apos;s own voice and a given rhythm and adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
especially older people who live alone practice not only to focus on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition seen by singing in the chor@@ us , H@@ ac@@ kler says .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
also the self @-@ esteem grows through singing in the choir .
to show oneself : if I practise for a long time , I become better and alert beyond me - this experience strengthens .
good reasons to start singing there is enough .
who wants to try out a new hobby , should not hesitate - even if he means to have little talent , L@@ enz advises .
you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who does hear when a sound goes beside it ?
in search of the right offer , sen@@ iors have different options , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
if someone sings from the circle of acquaintances in a senior &apos;s choir , one can simply join .
many towns also offer over@@ views of the choirs in the surrounding area .
those who want to sing in a church choir can contact the church or the church leader .
many people &apos;s choirs can also be found on the Internet .
those who do not have access to the Internet can ask the family , friends or neighbors for help with the internet research .
those who want to sing , should necessarily join a choir , tells H@@ ac@@ kler .
singing does the soul well and has something liber@@ ating - that is true for all ages .
cats react more sensi@@ tively than males to cri@@ es of young animals
bi@@ ologists have investigated in Hanover the effect that cat@@ fish babies have on adult animals .
to their surprise , the mi@@ ch@@ ewing did not leave the males cold - however , they always beha@@ ved in the difference to the females always the same .
female cats can recognize the reg@@ aining of cat bab@@ ys by the mi@@ cks of the little ones .
ten percent of them react faster to sounds of k@@ itt@@ ens who are in great need , as scientists have found out from the veter@@ inary university and the Hannover Medical School ( M@@ H@@ H ) .
han@@ go@@ vers also react to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - but always the same .
&quot; obviously , the acoustic differences between the mi@@ cks of less and strongly arous@@ ed juven@@ iles for the males are either not percep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; the bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding said of the M@@ H@@ H .
it is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the magazine &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology . &quot;
in a previous investigation , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens cri@@ es differs with the ur@@ gency of their dependency .
nine adult males and eight females were observed from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the M@@ H@@ H .
they were played for a herd of little ones , which were taken from the litter box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other hand , they were confronted with cri@@ es of more excited k@@ itt@@ ens that were additionally raised .
the researchers consider their results in spite of the small sample for meaningful results .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the females , even those who have not yet had their own offspring , re@@ acted to the cri@@ es , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they turned faster to the speaker when this calls of the very excited k@@ itt@@ ens played .
this ability may possibly be inn@@ ate or develop with the sexually mature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , scientists have already repeatedly investigated the reactions of women and men to baby sounds .
some studies showed that women were more sensitive to infants , whether they were mothers or not , bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Po@@ dol@@ sky takes access to Super@@ cup with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hak@@ an Sü@@ tt@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
a arrest warrant was issued against the former soccer star Hak@@ an Sü@@ ver in Turkey .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after the coup attempt , an important football match will be held in Turkey .
in front of the du@@ el of the arch@@ riv@@ els between Bes@@ i@@ kt@@ as Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ inski Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul to the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced .
already in the case of the im@@ position of the state of emergency after the attempted coup attempt in July , the government denied that the normal citizens &quot; everyday life should not be impaired .
this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the Mo@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len movement , which is responsible for the attempted put@@ sch .
football hasn &apos;t stopped even before football .
against the former strong i@@ cker Hak@@ an Sü@@ ver , the public prosec@@ utor asked for an arrest warrant .
therefore the South America living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ zh@@ r should be followers of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is held responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an .
although the exceptional condition imposed for 90 days is still valid until October , indeed , in fact , most Turks have no effect on the lives of most Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ni@@ ghtly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy @-@ guards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in public places throughout the country declared Erd@@ og@@ an on Wednesday for an end . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - split in tra@@ ilers and opponents of the Erd@@ og@@ an .
especially fans of the worker @-@ club Bes@@ i@@ kt@@ as are traditionally not among the friends of the president .
but what unites the wrath of the Turks in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military put@@ sch .
even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ i@@ kt@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there will be a special return to Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Cologne in the past season proved its sporty value : with 17 goals and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first season as top scor@@ er of his association .
in the end game against Fen@@ er@@ bah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 victory hit .
the newspaper &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured the tro@@ phy to his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season for the record master found a conci@@ li@@ atory finale . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the pre @-@ round kno@@ ck@@ out in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; go out early in the Europa League too early .
in the Sü@@ ver Li@@ g it was just about sixth .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have done that and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ sky . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master Bes@@ i@@ kt@@ as the year of the game was better .
above all thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who laid the foundation for the 14th title with 26 seasonal buff@@ ers as Sü@@ ver @-@ Li@@ g @-@ scor@@ pi@@ ko@@ king .
this is also the reason that the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
the AC Florence under contract and on Bes@@ i@@ kt@@ as gave only bor@@ rowed Gom@@ ez after the coup attempt , not to return because of the political situation in the country after his European holiday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he only has to say it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the specialist magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Club chief Fi@@ kre@@ t Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to this end , however , the storm would have to be ready to reno@@ unce around a third of its annual budget valued at 7.5 million euros , Or@@ man said clearly : &quot; we cannot pay his salary at Florence . &quot;
despite dop@@ ing : these athletes have med@@ als at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin was already blocked twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ owa is not allowed to start in Rio .
other out@@ performed athle@@ tics sinners can only laugh about it - they fight for med@@ als in Rio .
the theme of dop@@ ing remains the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games in Rio .
the Russian flo@@ ater Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ ova , who after a dop@@ ing block had filed her starting right shortly before the games , was plu@@ cked and burnt at her start ( 100 meters chest ) mer@@ cil@@ essly .
it was a bizarre scene : with a s@@ unken smile she was still proud in the hall and had provoked her appearance .
when she found out that she won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out into a j@@ ub@@ by storm .
but there are many more athletes , who start the Olympic Games in Rio despite the dop@@ ing past .
here is an overview :
Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100m @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics .
he was blocked two times for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
since its inc@@ eption , the 2004 Olympic champion runs even faster than before , it is over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds the number one in the world and is regarded as the biggest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ An@@ n F@@ ras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times world champion had to shut down a six @-@ month lock in 2010 after demonstrating the sei@@ z@@ ure of the pain by Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
she had a strong too@@ th@@ ache after an operation , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended herself .
Sandra Per@@ ko@@ vic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the 2012 Olympic champion was tested positively on the banned female stimul@@ ant meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine from 2010 to 2016 .
Per@@ ko@@ vic denied the missed dose and was blocked for six months .
the four far@@ th@@ est lit@@ ters this year go to the account of the great gold fav@@ ori@@ tin .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the Peking Olympic Champion and two @-@ time World Champion over 400 m , was tested positively in 2010 and had been closed for 21 months .
a means of penis enlargement was responsible , entered into Mer@@ ritt .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world about 200 and 400 m .
Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( hammer throw , Belarus ) : hardly an ath@@ lete has received so many med@@ als afterwards .
so T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later , after he was diagnosed with testosterone dop@@ ing .
the meanwhile 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to release Olympic silver 2004 due to ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the EM @-@ title 2006 because of testosterone abuse .
he also received the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games due to a verdict of the International Sport Court CA@@ S .
with 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m he ranks second in the world rank@@ ings .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walking , China ) : the world record player and fav@@ ori@@ ene first tested positive in May , but may still start in Rio .
in the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world championship , hints for taking a forbidden dietary supplement were found , the lock of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency WA@@ DA came out mil@@ dly and ran out on 13 July .
bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian viol@@ ates - Sever@@ al dead
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand comes into contact with the woman , said the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday early .
I had suffered cuts and had been treated in hospital , but I have already left it .
she planned her home journey at the beginning of September .
whether from the further explo@@ sions on the holiday island of Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern towns of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ um@@ phon , Austrian citizens are also still unclear .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with local authorities , so Schn@@ ö@@ ll .
the Hu@@ a H@@ in , located approximately 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , explo@@ ded two bombs on Thursday evening in a Night@@ life area .
according to police , a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
on Friday morning , two explo@@ sions went up again , yet another man was killed by the authorities .
also from Ph@@ u@@ ket a bomb explosion was reported in the morning .
a taxi driver was injured during the det@@ onation near the seaside resort of Pat@@ ong which was popular among holi@@ day@@ makers .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ east coast of the country another bomb explo@@ ded , killing a municipal employee .
according to the authorities , the explosive device had gone into the air in a flower bed in front of the Re@@ vier of the Co@@ ast@@ al Police .
finally , even det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast and in Ch@@ um@@ phon at the south @-@ east coast were demanding several wounded .
one goes from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was called .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bomb attacks carry the same hand@@ writing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said General general Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday morning to journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect it to be a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is too early to manifest itself on possible motives - but it is probably a matter of the actions of Muslim rebels .
Thai media also wanted to recognise a pattern typical of the bom@@ b@@ ings of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not related to the Islam@@ ist revol@@ t movement or international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sab@@ ot@@ age , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one should rather assume that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military j@@ un@@ ta .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days , the authorities would have received secret advice on im@@ min@@ ent attacks in the south of the country - however , they were not informed of the exact time and places . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is still unclear which group is behind the attacks .
the police showed their officials across the country to enhance security around important government buildings as well as airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts .
in Thailand , there are still smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but most of the time they are not directed towards tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that was used for years by Thailand &apos;s King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bo@@ l Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
after the bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs is recommen@@ ding to follow the instructions given by the Thai security authorities .
high security risk ( Level 3 ) applies to the provinces Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surroundings .
after disputes between security forces and Muslim populations , not necessary trips to these provinces will be dis@@ cour@@ aged .
increased security risk ( 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution dra@@ fted by the military j@@ un@@ ta .
this grants the military great influence also in the years to come .
Jun@@ ta boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said that the bombs were an attempt to wre@@ ak ha@@ vo@@ c while the country moves towards stability , improvement of economic situation and tourism .
the military un@@ ta , who had seized the power in 2014 after a period of bloody un@@ rest , re@@ affir@@ ms itself to have led the kingdom back to stability and order .
however , the military has not managed to get a grip on the rebel@@ li@@ ous rebellion of Muslim rebels since years in the extreme south of the country .
more than 6@@ 500 people have already been killed in the conflict .
almost a year ago , in Bangkok , an attack on a popular Hin@@ du shr@@ ine had been killed 20 people - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack of the recent history of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been targeted by the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to several regional offices , the constitutional conserv@@ ation@@ ists in the Con@@ federation have also set the group under observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the &apos; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular Movement &apos; we see evidence of efforts towards the liberal democratic basic order , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Federal Constitutional Princip@@ al Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ aß der Deutschen Presse @-@ Agentur in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus immigrants in Islamic faith or from the Middle East are treated in an extrem@@ ist way .
that is why we are now observing the movement .
the &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular Movement &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 .
it is opposed to &quot; multic@@ ultur@@ alism , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; and the loss of one &apos;s own identity by alien@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; constitutional conserv@@ ation@@ ists in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Niedersachsen , Saxony and Thurin@@ gia - are already observing the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ aries &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ aß said that his authority was closely coordinated with the local offices . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; groups such as the &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular Movement &quot; try to pick up their target group where it is , &quot; said the Constitutional Princip@@ al .
generally , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to address them with a you@@ thful language , often with Pop music .
the ties of Islam as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not a che@@ que advertisement for one &apos;s own cause .
the propaganda is intended to appeal to people emo@@ tionally .
young people are particularly vulnerable .
this is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; recently , reports on contacts of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ aries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from several federal states had been given to Af@@ D politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ ate said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have any findings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
possible contacts of this kind are only relevant for the constitutional complaint from a certain point .
it depends on whether the party - in this case - the Af@@ D - by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , changes their direction and become so extrem@@ ist .
the decisive factor here is whether such persons have control over the party .
this is not recognizable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a view to the clear increase of right @-@ wing criminal offen@@ ders and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee shel@@ ters Ma@@ aß said he would not yet speak of new right terrorism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in recent years we have found that there can be right @-@ wing terrorism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ tal Group .
it may well be that other right @-@ wing groups or small groups form , plan the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee shei@@ kh@@ s or attacks from other right @-@ wing extre@@ mis@@ tic motives .
however , a nationwide or Europe @-@ wide control of right @-@ wing terrorism is not recognizable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the previous groups were created at the regional level or in social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men expressed concern that many attacks went to the account of people who had previously not appeared in the right @-@ hand scene . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the wor@@ rying .
many of the susp@@ ects in attacks on asylum accommodation had previously not been known as criminals , politically motivated perpetr@@ ators or supporters of the right @-@ wing scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people therefore committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , who might have been politically in@@ different or voted for example CD@@ U , SPD or Linke , who , however , have radic@@ alised by right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist propaganda . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes an Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
not always the Olympics or World Records determine the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the bold appearance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro .
in the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly over@@ weight s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia were so slow that he was no longer seen in the TV pictures at times .

in the social networks , Hab@@ te was subsequently sent to the viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ended up with a gap of 48 seconds , finishing the 5@@ 9th place of 59 star@@ ters .
but it was rather his not just sporting figure , which attracted the attention of the international media .
why does the 24 @-@ year @-@ old take part in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ian received a special start@@ ing@@ right from the International Swimming Federation .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ represented countries more well@@ known .
because most sports@@ men are running in eth@@ th@@ op@@ ia , Hab@@ sburg wanted to do something else .
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
quickly the first nick@@ names made the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some media called him the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ bel of W@@ hale &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; following a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prosperity belly &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the English tab@@ loid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made fun with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his time , he only struck with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 metres of fre@@ estyle , played no part .
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
the running of Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i for media attention took place at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney .
unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to stand alone in a lead over 100 meters of fre@@ estyle .
at that time M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired at that time .
the then 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim in front of Olympia for eight months and had never had such a long distance before the competition .

Tru@@ mp sees the im@@ pending election defeat not so close
Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp is speaking at an election campaign in Florida .
if the election to the US president is nothing , Donald Tru@@ mp has already an alternative video .
he then goes on holiday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if Donald Tru@@ mp loses the U.S. presidential elections in November , it wouldn &apos;t matter : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ultimately it will either fold , or I have a very , very nice , long holiday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Republi@@ can candidate in a telephone interview with the U.S. television station CN@@ BC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it did not suff@@ ice for him for reasons of political correctness , that was fine , Tru@@ mp said .

post enters the trade with electric transpor@@ ters
an electric delivery vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other companies on the vehicle is obviously great .
the Post Office plans to sell its electric vehicle Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter .
soon the Group wants to start trading with the transpor@@ ter .
as of the coming year , the Post Office plans to offer its electric vehicles on the free market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to go on sale to third parties , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a post @-@ speaker on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for months , the company has tested its own Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter , with which letters and pack@@ ets are delivered , should also be sold to other companies .
post @-@ Executive Board Jürgen Ger@@ des had said that there are always inquiries , such as arti@@ sans .
according to the news magazine &quot; Der Spiegel , &quot; the Bonn Group plans to enter the mass production of vehicles shortly .
in its post @-@ production fabrication , the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and shift .
Ger@@ des announced that the Group wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and to make a complete change@@ over to environmentally friendly vehicles in the long term .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will make a very very robust step towards 2020 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can imagine that we change the entire fleet .

G@@ RP leadership dis@@ ap@@ points after dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures
the Consumer Research company Gf@@ K exchanges his boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the rear hat@@ ches suddenly came - but not quite surprising .
the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K felt that the chair of CEO Matthias Hart@@ mann is all the more uncertain the longer the successes promised by him remain .
turbul@@ ence at the head of the Nuremberg Market Research Group Gf@@ K : after again dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures and the res@@ ignation of the corporate management , the global number five of the sector faces a new beginning .
GF@@ RP CEO wants to leave the company at the end of the year .
the Chairman of the Gf@@ K Supervisory Board Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ert will reti@@ re from the Supervisory Board with effect from September 12 .
as early as the 1st of September , the management board of the Executive Board will take over the previous board member Gerhard Haus@@ ruck and shared the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is supposed to take over the function of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spokes@@ man &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until a successor for Hart@@ mann was found . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a reason for the re@@ tr@@ itte , the company called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; different views &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the long @-@ term business policy orientation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details did not want to name a business spokes@@ man on Friday .
who will be the market research company in the future is still unclear .
in An@@ le@@ ger@@ mans , on Friday , the shareholders were most recently the dis@@ appointment of the continued success of the restructuring initiated years ago .
Mr. Hart@@ mann has been at the Gf@@ K summit since 2011 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the fruits of restructuring are not to be seen even after 5 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the last G@@ RP business figures , every shar@@ ehol@@ ding will eventually become rest@@ less .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this was the case at BMW , that would make the qu@@ and@@ ts like that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
following set@@ backs in the preceding quarters , the company could not stop its losses in the second quarter of 2016 .
at € 36@@ 1.2 million , sales fell by 6.1 percent below the comparable period of the previous year .
in terms of the first half of the year , sales tot@@ alled 7@@ 21.@@ 2 million euros by 3.4 percent .
in view of its difficult economic situation , the company &apos;s profit in the second quarter affected above all .
the Group depreci@@ ation of 139 million euros , which was necessary in the Consumer Experience business unit , gave the Group a loss of € 14@@ 8.2 million .
the Gf@@ K achieved a net income of 19.@@ 7 million in the second quarter of 2015 .
accident - Bus sli@@ ps into cru@@ ises in cru@@ ises : eight injured
during an accident of a touring coach with 43 sen@@ iors as passengers , eight people were injured on Thursday in Kru@@ mm@@ hör@@ n ( district of Aur@@ ich ) .
two of the in@@ mates suffered severe injuries and shared the police with them .
the 66 @-@ year @-@ old coach of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach , according to her indications , had to ev@@ ade an opposite vice , which drove partly on the opposite lane .
the bus left the road to the right and sli@@ d into a dit@@ ch , as a spokes@@ woman of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the location of the bus , people could not leave the bus automatically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade liber@@ ated the in@@ mates .
six ambul@@ ances and a emergency ambul@@ ance came to the accident site on the road 2 .
the un@@ finished passengers were brought back to the Kru@@ mm@@ hör@@ ner district P@@ ew@@ sum by a public bus .
there they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel agency .
the investig@@ ators asked the truck driver and potential witnesses to report to the police .
the fees per cubic meter of waste water from 1 October 2016 for the area of the sewage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sh@@ ahl 3.@@ 44 instead of previously 2.@@ 10 euros ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / L@@ opp , 3.@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 26 euros ) and for Az@@ endorf 3.@@ 64 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 18 euros ) .
at the plant in Az@@ endorf the wastewater fee will increase again at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are necessary .
after an over@@ time calculation , the sewage price in Az@@ endorf will then be 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter .
as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , during the approval of the household by the district council Kul@@ mb@@ ach , Unter@@ coverings have been established for these waste water systems .
due to legal basis , the bar@@ endorf market is obliged to operate the facilities in a cost @-@ effective manner .
as of 1 October 2016 , citizens as well as the commercial and industrial companies from Wel@@ sh@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to dig deeper into the wall@@ ets .
the revenue increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
as head of the board of directors Herbert Schmidt displayed the body , a new calculation of the fees for the wastewater facilities of the market community was necessary .
over the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over and over @-@ covers from the preceding calculation period can also be equ@@ ated .
Schmidt founded the gravi@@ d increase in revenue by producing relatively small facilities with a very low waste water intake , between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year .
for example , due to the low distribution basis , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact .
in addition , the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly decreasing .
last but not least , due to their age of refur@@ bish@@ ment and repair , all three plants have a considerable extent on all three plants .
the facility in Az@@ endorf was nearly 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ sh@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp nearly 20 years .
Schmidt proved that the mechanical ventilation system in the Az@@ endorf sewage plant had to be replaced because of harm .
in the Pump@@ werk Wel@@ sh@@ ahl , the nearly 20 year old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led and the first sewage slu@@ dge had to be extended after nearly 20 years of operation , the sewage slu@@ dge was dispos@@ ed of and an additional ventilation capability had to be installed in order to be able to comply with the legal requirements in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these extraordinary expenses , the continued care and maintenance costs that have to be taken into account in the new calculation period have come into consideration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which in the previous years of 2011 / 2012 were significantly below the current level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; stone houses made it clear that with the low waste water intake in the three plants the expenses for the operation and maintenance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully hit &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , Schmidt has spar@@ ed the market community of great entertainment costs in the wastewater facilities over the past 20 years .
according to Stein@@ häuser , the situation for the mentioned facilities will continue to remain prec@@ arious in the long run , especially since the supply area of the sewage treatment association Fri@@ esen@@ bach@@ tal could not be extended by these facilities because these facilities are defici@@ ent .
Bulgaria books inflation for the first time in 8 months
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis in July .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first on zero since October last year , when positive 0.2 % have been posted .
the annual average inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 amounted to 1,@@ 0@@ 1.0 % , i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.2 % .
in July 2016 , compared to the previous month , a rise in prices for the following groups of consumer goods was observed : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
the prices fell in clothing and footwear ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0,1 % ) .
prices remained as in the previous month with alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; flats , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect as Asian car@@ ic@@ ature critic@@ ises
Sn@@ ap@@ chat states that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some ob@@ servers say it is in@@ sensitive to races .
with its fil@@ esystem , Sn@@ ap@@ chat allows around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that borders the absur@@ dity .
you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting .
the filters are in@@ und@@ able , property @-@ based tools that produce more than 30 million improved sel@@ fies per day .
all mis@@ steps are made public .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat filters have drawn criticism in the past in which they were accused of the fact that the app would promote black@@ face or white skin as a beauty ideal .
when this week some users suggested a filter that gave them s@@ lot@@ ted eyes , false teeth and blo@@ ated che@@ eks , some critics called a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yellow face . &quot;
they wondered if these repeated controversy sur@@ rendered to a larger problem that the company has diversity .
the news and ou@@ trage were widespread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mo@@ ther@@ board , a day after Sn@@ ap@@ chat announced that it would have de@@ activated the feature .
the company provided an ap@@ ology : the filter was intended as an homage to anim@@ e characters and not as a car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders , who have experienced racism , reminded the filter of hur@@ t@@ ful c@@ lich@@ és .
others rejected the anim@@ e comparison .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani wrote a Korean @-@ American art student whose tweet about the photos became widespread that the filter was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; vulnerable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the least unpleasant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the contrast between a very contradic@@ tory Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects .
it shows that the filter is not yellow @-@ faced , but that the yellow face was pulled into the degra@@ ding extreme .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural stum@@ bling block .
American culture seems to be ent@@ angled in an endless diversity and integration struggle , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand .
and Sn@@ ap@@ chat &apos;s big audience of young people - who are more diverse than their older counter@@ parts - could be more likely to expect sensitivity .
when one of Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats filters a picture that is insul@@ ting for a user , &quot; it is much more difficult that such things remain un@@ noticed than it was before , &quot; said 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday Z@@ hu , who worked as a product manager and engineer for medium , decided to delete her Sn@@ ap@@ chat account and asked others to do the same .
in an essay for medium and in a telephone interview , she said that she believes racial @-@ related controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity among the recruitment practices of Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu critici@@ zed the large part white , only male leadership and ended her essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
&quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce so that they can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colours that work there , but not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say about it . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint that Sn@@ ap@@ chat largely left un@@ answered .
the company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company .
on Thursday , Sn@@ ap@@ chat refused to discuss the cultural background of his employees , but according to a spokes@@ man , the company recently recru@@ ited a personnel responsible focusing on sub@@ represented population groups and on internal integration efforts .
Z@@ hu also said that she will leave her Sn@@ ap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that they are not O.@@ K. . &quot;
military leadership fal@@ si@@ fies IS@@ IS intelligence , establishes committee of the congress
military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence to draw an optimistic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , when the actual conditions on the ground were allowed , an inquiry committee of the Congress reported in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the Republi@@ can members of the Committee of Defence , Intelligence Com@@ mit@@ ees and Military Budget Com@@ mit@@ es , reports of great dis@@ content under Central Command intelligence analy@@ st who reported how superi@@ ors changed their assessments to US efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , shortly Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; intelligence gathering , typically out@@ sour@@ ced by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com com@@ man@@ ders , periodic@@ ally recorded a positive picture of US efforts against terrorism , as the actual conditions on site were allowed and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence agencies , &quot; cited a newspaper article .
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; Ken Cal@@ vert , republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives , stated .
the management mistakes in the Cent@@ Com range up to the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report presents detailed detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces .
although there is no direct evidence suggest@@ ing that government leaders under Obama have given directions to change reports , it shows how analysts are exposed to pressure from their superi@@ ors to draw an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements and statements before the Congress were clearly more positive than the facts &quot; stated the report .
for example , a Cent@@ Com member publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest would begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigation , so much is clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Con@@ gres@@ s@@ man from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the middle of the year 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the leaders of the Central Command changed intelligence reports to play down the danger of IS@@ IS in Iraq .
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans called on the Task Force after they were admitted that analysts were worried about manipulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings while the investigation continues .
additionally , further investigations of Cent@@ Com are underway by the Secretary General &apos;s General In@@ spec@@ tor .
democratic members of the intelligence service committee published their own findings on Thursday that coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; in 2014 and 2015 Cent@@ Com created an over@@ ly limited process for creating intelligence assessments on IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; announced the highest @-@ level democr@@ at in the steering committee , a member of the House of Represent@@ atives , Adam B. Schiff , in a statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Schiff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; har@@ med mor@@ als among analysts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave very little room for dis@@ sent@@ ing views . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and the democr@@ ats stated that there was no evidence of interven@@ ing in the White House at Cent@@ com An@@ alysts concerning a &quot; certain political opinion . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the preliminary results of the proceedings of the Congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon &apos;s General In@@ spec@@ tor who was included following complaints by Cent@@ Com .
L@@ t. C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon spokes@@ man , stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the reports of the Congress , while the investig@@ ators of the General In@@ spec@@ tor were still under way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he also stated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ gent views on the interpretation of complex data and that intelligence agencies and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a claim that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) .
the alleg@@ ations of last year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest estimates of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of divisions more than ten years ago , when a Cent@@ com Analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a document about how the then government under George W. Bush only fores@@ aw a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the revol@@ t against the current reporting of the Islamic State .
last year , the team headed by Mr. Hoo@@ ker states that , contrary to the statements by the government , air@@ strikes against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State would have no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , as these temporary refin@@ eries took into operation in order to sell oil on the black market .
however , this recognition has not been published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ Com &apos;s then ordered Commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legislature for his over@@ ly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin was retired in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel at the Central Command .
the United States winning fourth match in the field ho@@ ckey of women , a show@@ down with the UK is ahead
one day after they had shot three goals during 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American Feld@@ ho@@ ckey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable achievement , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she could not remember that ever done .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their goals in mind .
however , they know that the American women are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are also in their group with the Brit@@ ons in the first place , which remain un@@ defeated after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place each in their group of six teams .
the first placed will make the strong Dutch get a bit longer out of the way that the other group will lead .
as always the game may go out on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising vor@@ tex by their success story , four years after they landed at the last London games on the last of 12 places .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had a ho@@ ckey stick in her hands for the first time at three years ( her two older sisters played sports at Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became the national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
she missed the 2008 Olympics because she couldn &apos;t qualify for the cad@@ re .
then came the year 2012 in which everything went wrong for her and her team .
in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engli@@ sh@@ man , coach of the national team and thus began to turn things better .
&quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; B@@ am said .
we did not have the work@@ load in London that we now have .
we have been able to rip the ru@@ dder completely .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the door @-@ row in the first half of the game with a back @-@ stop from the s@@ ut@@ ure area .
India had gone into play without victory in the tournament , but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the score from 1 @-@ 0 up to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into her hands .
she performed a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then pulled into the middle and pulled the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ z@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the keeper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games .
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in a good position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
amid the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline
wherever you are , how late it is , it &apos;s the Olympics .
the events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and unavoid@@ able , a fast relay between competition and aspir@@ ation .
it is like the Olympic torch itself is a burning staff handed down from the w@@ rist@@ watch to a swi@@ mmer to the tri@@ ath@@ lete .
you cannot turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to the conversation of your neighbour in the waiting queue in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ aks or the quar@@ rel between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there are Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who was there for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s black with dimples , could well be among those known names sent to Prime Time through sponsors and well @-@ being TV advertising , if he were a swi@@ mmer , gymn@@ ast or even fen@@ cer .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights for gold in the Olympic tramp@@ ol@@ ines .
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate every event iden@@ tically .
further from the centre , partly in the shade are the sports that are not generally accepted : gun shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the breast @-@ swimming and may it rule it for a long time .
but if I like to make arguments for my particular favourite , then let me draw attention to the dis@@ crete charm of the trampoline .
although the trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , it was so spar@@ sely perceived in the last 16 years that many of the ones I had asked , did not know that it is an olymp@@ ic port at all .
this could also be regional ignorance .
although the USA sent athletes to the competition , there has never been a medal in jumping on the trampoline and has had an ath@@ lete until 2012 , who has made it to the final round .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to divide the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Can@@ adi@@ ans for the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend this year &apos;s Gold Med@@ al from London .
jumping on the trampoline has a certain out@@ sider charm , partly because it sounds suitable for the un@@ enlightened ear for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ school than the one for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should admit that I &apos;m not an expert , but only an experienced enthusi@@ ast .
it has humor@@ istic potential - the carto@@ on@@ able trem@@ bling of his never @-@ ending up@@ surge - but also the Gra@@ zie of gymn@@ as@@ tics and diving , the two sports which essentially unite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tramp@@ ol@@ ines &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , which means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spring@@ board &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
asp@@ iring conqu@@ er@@ ors jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements ( turning , pi@@ ke and sal@@ tos ) before they land on their feet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are rated according to official Olympi@@ apro@@ gram of performance , difficulty and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flight time &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thirty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete against each other in Rio .
the common olymp@@ ic vector is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ sts have to go far@@ ther , faster , up and over in their quest for gold , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes back and forth , up and down on the playground .
they not only hunt the finish line or the output wall , but also in the tel@@ ev@@ ised broadcasting a more ridi@@ culous aim : the world or the olymp@@ ic record .
the goal @-@ oriented aspir@@ ation is no@@ bel , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even touch a spect@@ ator with tears .
but it &apos;s also what I feel fati@@ gu@@ ed when watching these games .
the trampoline offers a resp@@ ite .
the vector of the trampoline is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
he or she bo@@ unces off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down , then effort@@ lessly back up .
there is also a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity .
it is as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can be .
the qualification and final rounds of the women will be held on Friday afternoon , at 13@@ .00 Eastern Time streaming ; the men on Saturday also at 13@@ .00 .
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the final rounds as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14@@ .00 .
in the midst of the Olympic @-@ Man@@ ia , they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably over@@ looked in the general tum@@ ult .
if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the Ang@@ us and the objective of male ath@@ lete - as the Male US Tur@@ ner suggested recently - Mr Do@@ ol@@ ey awaits its air rin@@ ding , new fan base .
&quot; a generation prot@@ ested &quot; in Ethiopia , Long is an ally of the United States
violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators calling for political changes in Ethiopia met with a violent resistance of the government .
witnesses say that dozens of prot@@ esters were killed during clas@@ hes with the police .
is Ethiopia just breaking together ?
in the last ten years , it was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy .
but in recent months protests against the government troubled the country and spread more and more areas .
last week thousands of people rus@@ hed into the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
according to human rights organisations , the response of the government was ru@@ th@@ less .
witnesses stated that polic@@ emen shot and killed dozens of un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
videos about the protests , probably from the last or the beginning of this year , show how security professionals hit young people with sticks while they were forced to make a stand against a wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the head of the UN Human Rights Council is now asking for an in @-@ depth investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa at the International Crisis Group , a research group .
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
American military and intelligence agencies work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terrorist haz@@ ards beyond the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , get so much Western help .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at considerable speed .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commu@@ ter train in the capital Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
the roads are usually quiet , safe and clean .
although Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have consistently led the government &apos;s oppression - the opposition in the country was restricted , although dissi@@ dents were effectively sil@@ enced .
many were sent into exile or in prison , killed or driven into the vast expan@@ ses of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; when you supp@@ ress people and have no other options other than to protest , it breaks off , &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in Ethiopia .
the entire youth protests .
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stran@@ gl@@ ehold in terms of power of the ruling coalition .
following a widely critic@@ ised election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament .
at the same time , tensions continue along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea ; a struggle for this jag@@ ged , controversial line called hundreds of lives in June .
analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the O@@ rom@@ o Liberation Front or the O@@ ga@@ den National Liberation Front , which have been forced more or less in recent years , could exploit the turbul@@ ence and re @-@ arm themselves .
several factors explain why feelings of bitter@@ ness after years of war@@ dness explo@@ de under the surface now .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
only in recent years many Ethiop@@ ians have been able to communicate with the social media , since cheaper smartphones have become more and more frequent and improved internet services .
even if the government blocks the access to Facebook and Twitter what it does at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people can still communicate via internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they stay .
several young Ethiop@@ ians admitted that they were gathered to protests like this .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia .
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
for e@@ ons the Am@@ har@@ as prosp@@ ering , who come from Ethiopia &apos;s predominantly Christian High@@ lands , in politics and economy as they exploited the Oro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are and live in low@@ land areas .
but that is exactly what changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are there to coordinate below a screen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ atu Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the largest protests took place in the areas of Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is un@@ fair@@ ally dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tig@@ ray , which accounts for about 6 percent of the population and which are dominant in the military , intelligence services , commerce and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was until his death on an un@@ publi@@ ci@@ zed illness in 2012 for 17 years of Ethiop@@ ian Prime Minister .
he was regarded as a tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think about corners .
analysts say that he was particularly well vers@@ ed in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ content and using special officers to process opponents and make them harmless .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime lacks this basic skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively obsc@@ ure reasons to take the position of Mr Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of northern Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south .
analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time that Ethiopia had witnessed such a uph@@ eav@@ al in 2005 , after thousands were prot@@ esting against elections which , according to the information given by analysts , were apparently fu@@ cked by the government and subsequently stolen .
during the ensu@@ ing ra@@ ids many prot@@ esters were killed , even if there were less than in the last months and this time of un@@ rest passed relatively quickly .
development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new commu@@ ter train , as well as their meas@@ urable progress in poverty allevi@@ ation .
but apparently this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal de@@ ple@@ tion of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it assumes a dangerous ethnic form .
prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ an city , attacked by Tig@@ ray attacked shops and hate against the Tig@@ ray become more and more common in social media .
analysts say that the protests brought the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as a stron@@ gh@@ old for neighboring Somalia , although it recently announced that it closed this basis .
while West@@ ern@@ ers clearly want to support democracy , he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volati@@ le region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin balancing act . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp explains his claim Obama was founded IS@@ IS was &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
Donald J. Tru@@ mp tried to disp@@ el the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking that his repeated asser@@ tion , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton would have been the &quot; Fo@@ under &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not serious .
this clari@@ fication raised new questions about the communication skills of the Republi@@ can Republi@@ can candidate , whether he was able to communicate clearly and understandable to the American public .
it also ent@@ ails his comrades who endeav@@ our to take care of him during an event@@ ful phase , in the peculiar position of decl@@ aring statements that he could not have said at all .
after he had made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tru@@ mp declined in relation to the alleg@@ ation on Thursday and insist@@ ed in interviews that he really did not intend to interpret , the president and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS .
but in an early morning T@@ we@@ et on Friday Mr. Tru@@ mp said he was just sar@@ c@@ astic .
the T@@ we@@ et was contrary to the previous day when Mr. Tru@@ mp said in a series of interviews , he meant the accus@@ ation completely seriously .
when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ or@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t wanted to help Mr. Tru@@ mp to weak@@ en the statement that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate didn &apos;t want to know about it .
the last storm of criticism ki@@ cks down on Mr. Tru@@ mp while trying to focus his campaign on the economic situation due to falling demand figures .
Mr. Tru@@ mp and Mrs. Clinton talked about the business situation in Mich@@ ig@@ an this week .
on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp tried to return to this subject again .
comm@@ enting on Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring .
Mr. Tru@@ mp already brought sar@@ cas@@ m back to his defense .
at the end of July he drew strong criticism when he said that the Russians were to chop Ms Clinton &apos;s emails , but later he explained , &quot; Of course , I meant the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tru@@ mp to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic boundaries of politics and then rowing back as needed .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans as they arrive , and then &quot; clarify &quot; depending on how the reaction fails . &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who monitors the language of both candidates .
but I think he &apos;s clever enough to keep his statements vag@@ u@@ ely enough so that they can be interpreted in various ways .
instead of def@@ ying the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tru@@ mp adopted an even stronger tone since his survey values have gone further .
a new survey by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist published on Friday showed a major lead in North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tru@@ mp is generally trying to ap@@ olog@@ ise for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often acc@@ uses his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or mis@@ understand his humor .
but while strengthening the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s j@@ okes have brought his loyal co @-@ workers into the uncomfortable situation to stand at him regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be .
Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tru@@ mp@@ s most prominent advoc@@ ates , took great effort to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview of Thursday .
&quot; I believe what he says is legitimate , political comment@@ aries &quot; said Mr Giuli@@ ani about the correctness of Mr. Tru@@ mp &apos;s statements about whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State .
it is true in this sense that before Obama IS IS an almost unknown , small organization , he called them back ben@@ d@@ les , completely wrong , and therefore it happened because he with@@ drew troops from Iraq .
most mainstream rep@@ ublic@@ ans are attempting to argue that the Obama administration , in which Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State , allowed IS@@ IS to spread by taking control of the situation in the Middle East .
before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp continued his attacks on the media and accused them of lying on each of his words and being pre@@ ju@@ dic@@ ed against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he de@@ fied the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , j@@ un@@ u@@ chs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; television experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the Democrats mo@@ cked Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s ap@@ ology as just another proof that he was un@@ suitable for president &apos;s office .
once displaced by the price of the market , Café in Green@@ point comes back
verb Cafe was a nice café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , in which one could pay only cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi , but served fine coffee for 15 years .
of course , the prices came out of Bed@@ ford Avenue store front .
the store So@@ ap Cher@@ ie , who replaced the verb in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
native people smo@@ ked it as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel is apart and Ver@@ b is now a soap business . &quot;
but if New York is changing , it is also new finding .
a rev@@ ital@@ ised club opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new club has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same employees and a similarly simple atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the club is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ standing employee of the old café , the owner and managing director of the new coffee shop .
he started working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and stayed there until the end .
when a customer offered to provide money for a new foreign office , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , kept a lot of things .
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the bag@@ els bought the same es@@ pres@@ so blade model .
it even uses the same lights from the old club .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and cheese and gar@@ nis@@ hes such as cap@@ ers and sour onions .
there are natural rice dishes .
the café serves no beer , but there are fresh juices .
after nine months Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many old customers were also displaced by prices from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a client .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg earlier and visited the club on a regular basis .
even after being moved to Green@@ point , she would take the way .
after the club closed , she gave up the coffee drinking for a while , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it became clear to me that it was the coffee and culture in the club that I liked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now they drink coffee again , even if they put a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on that day instead of their usual coff@@ ees , which is another new addition .
since the beginning of the club , Tom Ros@@ enthal is a loyal customer since the beginning of the club in 2003 .
he went there before the work and inevitably ordered the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came fourth after seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu .
today Ros@@ enthal is still getting his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had no anger over the fact that the soap business occupied the old business room .
in fact , the owners of So@@ ap Cher@@ ie offered to make a special soap for clubs with cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee in cafes as an ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will go to her offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional Polish inhabitants of Green@@ points also accepted the café .
a new customer has translated the menu into Polish , and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he &apos;s going to send them out soon so that his new neighbours feel welcome .
the location also has other advantages .
a local juice store wants to fill and sell the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee .
there is a chance that the café expands to a neighboring building .
for many customers , a new club is enough to get their old favorites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said that he was destroyed on the ground when the cafe closed .
when the new cafe opened , Wh@@ itt said that entering the restaurant and the Order felt a new coffee like a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had to smell it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plentiful meal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his ascension to the President , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roosev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as a g@@ our@@ mets President Roosev@@ elt had a F@@ ai@@ ble for refined delicacies of Fi@@ fth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land tur@@ tle soup .
its menu on that day was slightly more modest : stuff@@ ed eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and a p@@ ud@@ ding p@@ ud@@ ding as dessert .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jane Good@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was also a message to the Americans about how to eat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ es last book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; acted by Chinese cuisine in the USA , while in their book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was told about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side from a food perspective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; appearing on Tuesday in Har@@ per Publishing , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a re@@ porter in the Iron Hill &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , sn@@ ail snack at the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the crash of the stock market crash in 1929 .
bri@@ ck@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive oil , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key was eaten with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mixture .
when the re@@ porter stopped min@@ ced meat , this was the pair for a discussion about the food in the era of the Great Depression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rich food was very popular , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ziegel@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and something cheap which extends the ingredient .
imagine so many pe@@ an@@ uts to eat that they serve them as dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ inn@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have settled in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ you @-@ can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
team of women coo@@ ks for male fel@@ lows and it was served fresh baked p@@ ate for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
it was the Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; traces the roads with which the country was going to no longer be the land of land .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when food was a central , ten@@ se issue for Americans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e told why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just as ten@@ se was the new budget : mysterious food such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ies became basic food , the c@@ asser@@ ole as a &quot; wonderful way of re@@ taining food remains , &quot; I noticed that coo@@ ks could hide un@@ appe@@ ti@@ zing ingredients in a cre@@ amy sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced with cheaper dr@@ y@@ ness .
meat , which was the center of American cuisine for years , became a rare luxury .
peculiar compounds have been tried since a high cal@@ orie and nutri@@ tious gr@@ ati@@ fication had priority over taste or even healthy food .
during her research for the book , which also includes recipes , Bri@@ ck@@ man made a dish of this epoch , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter , too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a popular addition at lunch@@ time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bri@@ ck@@ mann continues : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions do not fit together .
it was typical for many of the household recipes .
as never before or since , household econom@@ ists - including Lou@@ ise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - assumed the country &apos;s eating habits .
in publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , she encouraged women to become &quot; house@@ wives &quot; and the challenge of converting P@@ amp@@ e as cre@@ amy sp@@ agh@@ etti with car@@ rots into delicious meals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a feast of historical delicacies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially tasty are the reports of the government &apos;s response to the hungry citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver &apos;s L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ C@@ ake food posture .
while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa farmer &apos;s cuisine of his kitchen , he spoke as the million@@ aire man of the world he became .
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; Co@@ e said .
he ate in an almost gil@@ ded dining room and wore a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was terri@@ bly realistic .
President Roosev@@ elt might have committed the same mistake if his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to make an example with his stomach .
as described in the book , the leader of a house@@ keeper led to no interest in flavors by Mrs. Roosev@@ elt that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most comfor@@ ting prepared . &quot;
many of the types of the era of Great Depression , deal with food , was rejected as soon as the country got back on its legs .
the legacy lies on our continued focus on calories and food , said Ziegel@@ man , as well as how science was applied to food .
the couple gave a better understanding of the eating habits of bri@@ ck@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law when writing the book - for example how they could not throw food away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had a real fear of wa@@ sting food , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; bri@@ ck@@ man rec@@ alled , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They actually made people sick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the exploitation of the wind .
after the plates at Eisen@@ berg &apos;s were evacu@@ ated , they and Co@@ e produced a dessert that they had cooked at home : the pl@@ um @-@ lay@@ ered dessert that President Roosev@@ elt did eat at noon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ziegel@@ man , adding that it was a usual trick to miss a chic name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no whi@@ pped cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everybody willingly exchanges a spoon in the counter , brown gli@@ b@@ ber .
amaz@@ ingly , it did not ta@@ unt bad .
Co@@ E picked up a rash three times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like a Can @-@ Do Bud@@ ge@@ ti@@ zer , he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
killed in bomb attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life into play to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar turned his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died for a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime .
O@@ mar was a member of White Helm@@ ets , a civil protection group that , according to Bild @-@ Zeitung , saved almost 6@@ 0,000 people .
29@@ 00 volunteers place their own lives on the game in order to draw people from bom@@ bed houses and to make first aid in the war zone .
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
O@@ mar was the face of the group : a video of the Zivil@@ dienst , which shows him during an 11 @-@ hour rescue from the rub@@ ble of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syrian a shining figure in the horror of the war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as heroes he never saw himself , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; For me this is the real ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I die to save lives , I think that God sees in me a mart@@ yr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before O@@ mar himself fell victim to an attack , he spoke in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria .
the helicop@@ ters have dropped four barrels above the Alz@@ adi@@ a district , one filled with chlorine gas .

Greenland : the oldest verteb@@ rate is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks frequently come to the surface only in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an inquiry on board the ship ship S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks get offspring only with 150 years of offspring .
lei@@ surely , the Greenland @-@ shar@@ k swi@@ ms along the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour it reaches an average of just 1,@@ 220 metres wide .
only when it arrives , the five @-@ metre @-@ long animal acceler@@ ates at full 2.6 km / h - and with this top speed is half as fast as a seal .
this lifestyle characterized by slow@@ ness seems to be a pan@@ ac@@ ea for a high age .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reported in the journal &quot; Science &quot; in any case by a Gr@@ ön@@ land @-@ shar@@ k , who could be 3@@ 92 years old .
Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein from the Max Planck Institute for Dem@@ ographic Research in Rostock discusses this life span , which represents a world record for verteb@@ rates .
ad@@ mitt@@ edly , the evolution@@ ist has long assumed that Greenland will become stone @-@ old .
only the evidence was missing .
Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks are hard to observe , after all , they live mainly in the ice @-@ sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coast of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually only occur in winter on the surface .
researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks .
her slow @-@ motion @-@ tempo measured her , when she equipped six animals with a transmitter in front of Sp@@ it@@ s@@ bergen .
nevertheless , researchers found the remains of a seal in the stomach of an animal , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw@@ bone of a young polar bear .
they might ch@@ ase sleeping animals or pat@@ ro@@ ls at the bottom of the ice cream and look for cad@@ aver who tor@@ ches from higher water @-@ layers down@@ wards .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues investigated 28 Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks , which fishermen caught between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch from the depth of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cm long , while the largest 50@@ 2 centimet@@ re was measured .
in order to determine the age of the animals , they analysed the lens nucle@@ us of the sh@@ arks with the carbon @-@ 14 method .
this centre of the eye lens is already born before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins contained therein are no longer renewed .
the two smallest sh@@ arks had notably much carbon @-@ 14 in the lens nucle@@ us .
its birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s , when nuclear dis@@ armament attempts to bring greater amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere .
on the other hand , with 220 centimet@@ ers of length , the len@@ tic@@ ular nucle@@ us contained a low surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from nuclear weapons testing , so it should have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 .
on the other hand , all larger Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ h@@ arks had normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts in their len@@ tic@@ ular nucle@@ us , which result from cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock for a 4@@ 93 @-@ cen@@ timeter long Greenland hal@@ low showed an age of 3@@ 35 years , while the record shar@@ k with 50@@ 2 centimet@@ ers might even be 3@@ 92 years old .
that Greenland @-@ shar@@ k females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known .
now the researchers were able to classi@@ fy the length of an old age .
since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ ers probably stood at the threshold of the sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years , Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks with the multip@@ lication obviously leave at least one and a half centuries time .
this is also likely to be world record for verteb@@ rates .
that such methane em@@ bl@@ ems live mainly in icy waters is no coincidence .
the previous record holder , a 211 @-@ year old Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ w@@ al , whose sp@@ eck stuck to the neck a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ po@@ on point , was caught in front of Alaska .
due to the low temperatures , the organism of the living animals often runs on as@@ par@@ ag@@ us flame .
so they mature later - and age slowly .
in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are also often very big .
because the volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal loses heat .
the heat loss of one gram mouse therefore is much larger than with one gram of elephant .
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants as possible as early as possible , &quot; explains the evolution bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein .
a very large animal , on the other hand , should invest its resources more in a long life .
building site in double pack
with topics related to construction , the municipal council has focused mainly on the recent meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with relief , the committee accepted the announcement by Mayor Robert P@@ utz , that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally the marketing of the recently shown residential areas can begin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the land , par@@ cel@@ ing and development issues have been clari@@ fied and the applications for measurement have been clari@@ fied , the sale of land in the residential areas &quot; Road l@@ weg &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( area Bin@@ der@@ straße - expansion section 1 ) is no longer in the way to prospective buyers .
the Municipal Council is convinced that the cultivation areas in the rural and quiet residential community of Schön@@ au will appeal to young families and elderly sen@@ iors in equal measure .
as it was said , builders can immediately report to the town hall , and the municipal council is expected to advise the municipal council in its September session .
in order to also request inquiries concerning the reloc@@ ation of further industrial enterprises , combined with the creation of jobs , the municipal council decided to change the land use plan newly created in the spring of this year in sub @-@ sections .
thus , in the area of Unter@@ zeit@@ lar@@ n , the commercial area already declared there is extended by two par@@ c@@ els in the direction of state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt benefits from the Bre@@ x@@ it
the city on the Main has therefore the best opportunities to attract new jobs and companies from London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg .
&quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Bre@@ x@@ it vote , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the I@@ W &apos;s financial markets and real estate markets .
after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum it is uncertain whether money stores continue to run from London from financial transactions across the EU .
for the so @-@ called EU passport they have been granted authorisation in the UK until now .
these are currently using large US banks .
several banks have already announced to shift jobs .
the lob@@ b@@ ying association &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; reck@@ ons with 10@@ 000 new jobs in the Main within five years .
for Frankfurt , such as the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the euro@@ zone , as well as other important authorities , such as the European Insurance Super@@ vision E@@ IO@@ PA and the Risk Committee ES@@ R@@ B .
while in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) is headquartered , but this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks , as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luxembourg insi@@ sts on a big fund industry , but just like Dublin does not cut off at the infrastructure .
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport .
furthermore , the city with easily available commercial properties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris it is not easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
moreover , at the Seine , the r@@ ents for first @-@ class commercial properties were 50 percent higher than the Main .
in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime .
in a ranking of the Management Coun@@ sel@@ ing Merc@@ er , the city sits on seventh place in Luxembourg , Dublin on No@@ .@@ 33 and Paris at 3@@ 7th place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even if quality of life is a matter of preference : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its already strong position as a financial location for the European internal market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concludes the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in spite of Bre@@ x@@ it vote , London will remain the most important financial center in Europe , my econom@@ ist .
the balance of forces also speaks for this : in London , according to numbers from the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba , around 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking industry in the end of 2015 , in Frankfurt it was 6@@ 2,500 .
Gilead receives legal costs from the hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
a US National Jud@@ ge decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to reimbur@@ sement of the legal costs arising from the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ ts C law@@ suit with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June , Gilead was exemp@@ ted from a compensation payment of $ 200 million for the violation of two patents from Mer@@ ck , which were related to the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs so@@ val@@ di and Har@@ by@@ i of Gilead , after a US judge uncovered a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of Mer@@ ck , including the opinion and other un@@ ethical acts .
in the case of rising the law@@ suit on Thursday , U.S. official Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to a reduction of the costs incurred during the defense of the case .
Mer@@ ck is trying to equ@@ ate with Gilead , which dominates the market of a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
the case goes back to 2013 when Gilead and Mer@@ ck compl@@ ained each other and claimed ownership of laboratory work , including Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir , the active ingredient in the drug of Gilead .
troops backed by the United States say they have reg@@ ained full control over Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State
troops supported by the United States have rec@@ ap@@ tured full control of the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters in the city left it , said a group spokes@@ man on Friday .
after the exo@@ dus of the remaining group of fighters who have buried themselves within the city , the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) are currently fighting the city .
they released over 2,000 civilians , held by the fighters as host@@ ages , and informed Shar@@ fan Dar@@ wish of the Man@@ bi@@ j military council of Reu@@ ters allied with the D@@ KS .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city is under complete control now , but we just carry out clearing work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton &apos;s income earning 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and paying 3@@ 4.2 % federal taxes
H@@ illary Clinton announced on Friday her tax return for 2015 , which sur@@ rendered the Democrats and her husband an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 Clinton &apos;s USD 1 million donated funds for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former Secretary Bill Clinton delivered an income of USD 3 million to the publisher Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for her book on her term of office in the State Department .
Clinton &apos;s candidate for the Vice @-@ Pres@@ idency , Sen@@ ator Tim ka@@ ine from Virginia , has published his last ten @-@ year tax statements together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton .
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; said Clinton &apos;s campaign hero@@ in J@@ enni@@ fer Pal@@ mi@@ eri in a statement .
in a blat@@ ant contrast , Donald Tru@@ mp is hiding behind false preten@@ ders and re@@ trac@@ ts regarding his promises to date .
it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax statements , although they are not obliged by law because of this .
Tru@@ mp , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have stated as a reason for his refusal to take tax ex@@ ams by tax authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the train , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s campaign hel@@ per Ian S@@ ams on Twitter with regard to the publication of the presidential candidate of the Democrats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , Tru@@ mp@@ s Special Ad@@ visor , told CN@@ N that he would not allow Tru@@ mp to publish something before the tax inspections were not completed .
tru@@ mp critics , among other things , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already announced that his refusal to raise questions regarding assets , his donations for char@@ itable organisations , his business@@ men and various other connections , especially with Russia .
Clinton has already top@@ pled on the subject and released a video on the Internet on Friday in which high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tru@@ mp calls to publish his tax return .
on Thursday she spoke about the topic during a speech on the economy in Mich@@ ig@@ an .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and publish his tax statements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Poli@@ tico has reported that during the 1990s , Tru@@ mp paid no taxes or only very little taxes , and a business journalist of the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax consultants on Friday , stating that this could still be the case .
federal taxes have become an issue in the campaign .
Clinton supports a regulation named after billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett , which would make sure that people who earn more than USD 1 million will pay a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton in the last week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called for Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate has his seat , Tru@@ mp at a meeting to exchange their tax statements .
Buff@@ ett said that he was also subjected to a tax examination of the I@@ RS and Tru@@ mp had &quot; fear &quot; before the voters and not before the tax authorities .
Clinton &apos;s campaign has withdrawn tax return until 2007 .
the Clinton &apos;s , who now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , aver@@ aged an effective federal tax rate of about 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of around 4@@ 0.5 % .
the tax return of Clinton &apos;s 2015 showed that these only USD 100 were related to their income as a salary , unlike most Americans .
their main investment was a cost @-@ effective index fund from which Clinton &apos;s divi@@ den@@ ds and revenues amounted to USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 .

con@@ doms with ci@@ li@@ pu@@ der , fire@@ works promote Tanz@@ ani@@ as elephant protection
conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania are using an un@@ orthodo@@ x way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going to settlements in humans - they throw con@@ doms on them that are filled with milk powder .
the method proved to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , who had the idea for years ago , has intensified its promotion together with the US natural protection by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non @-@ violent four @-@ step method to protect their houses and crops without hur@@ ting animals .
previously , many sp@@ ears have used to defend themselves .
Friday is the Day of the Water Day dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we were able to observe a change in their attitudes within these communities , while they are much more confident that they can hold the eleph@@ ants away from their fields without har@@ ming the elephant , &quot; said the CEO of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell in a message .
the first two steps include lighting the elephant with a torch and blowing into a horn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chil@@ i cloud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ der mixed with earth is packed together with a fire@@ work body into a con@@ dom , whose end is turned to the ignition only .
when it is lit , the con@@ dom expands with a b@@ ang and spreads fine dust to the air .
a touch is usually already sufficient to hunt the elephant .
one last possibility is a thro@@ wer , which shoots a gold turn fire@@ work into the air , causing a loud , bright explosion .

however , the municipal council now unanim@@ ously rejected the application for the new construction of a sales office near the Rhine river in the immediate vicinity of the Rhein@@ bank building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fundamentally we welcome new businesses , but at this location in exposed locations on the Rhine shore , this ki@@ osk is not suitable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U faction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jewish director sm@@ ashed Berlin hotel because Israeli pres@@ election was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; sum@@ mons - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ashed a media uprising , having revealed that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin did not list Israel &apos;s pre @-@ election since it had requested Arabic guests according to an employee . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ a , &quot; made his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the country &apos;s list of countries .
however , the country was not listed among the countries that could be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel has been eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i B@@ rist@@ ol offers an opportunity to choose Israel from its own call center .
looking for an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception .
the answer he received there &quot; shocked him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel staff said that the measure was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliber@@ ate decision by management of the Kemp@@ inski hotels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason behind this was even more fur@@ y in the director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election is deleted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was quoted by Lanz@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ mann called this a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great dis@@ grace &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were horri@@ fied and dis@@ ma@@ yed by this event .
this is really very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even greater dis@@ grace .
this does not need any explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident triggered a fairly large resonance in the internet , where people called it a sc@@ andal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some subordin@@ ated to the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rep@@ uted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the alleged calls for Arab guests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be ashamed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was said in a different post , in which it was pointed out that the hotel located on the noble Kur@@ für@@ sten@@ damm is close to a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly dismissed all accus@@ ations and called the incident a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ap@@ olog@@ ised &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct order &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to not take up Israel into the electoral list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung quoted a spokes@@ man for the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
adds that the country code is now added .
police activ@@ ates tear gas &amp; rubber bul@@ lets against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
students met on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo with the police when they gathered to demonstrate the government &apos;s reforms for the public education system .
the police put tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against the demonstr@@ ators .
the difficulties began when police officers tried to disper@@ se the students , which led the police to use rubber feet and tear gas .
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations in order to express their const@@ ern@@ ation on the plans .
according to the governor of the Federal State of Sao Paulo Ger@@ al@@ do Al@@ ck@@ min , some less than 100 public schools are closed , while 300@@ ,000 students are converted to save money .
some of the demonstr@@ ators were seen gra@@ ff@@ iti against the provisional President Michel Tem@@ him spra@@ ying on walls .
the recent protests happened several days after demonstr@@ ators went to the streets to support the suspended President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff who had been dismissed from the office by a vote of the Senate .
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly increases to 71 % - RT Business
the lifting of sanctions grew according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , the trade turnover between Moscow and T@@ eher@@ an in the year @-@ on @-@ year comparison by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent .
since international sanctions have been lifted against Iran , the interest in Russian enterprises has grown heavily on businesses in the country , the ambassador assured .
Russian companies are taking up existing ties with Iran , while new companies are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , further commercial expansion is one of the biggest priorities for bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noted that the trade turnover between Russia and Iran rose by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent in the first five months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and was $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports in Iran grew by 9@@ 1.5 percent and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trade boost &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was achieved by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan continues this year by a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
last year , the Russian foreign representation issued around 35@@ ,000 Vis@@ as , primarily travel visa , to Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries with regard to the number of tourists in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , only relatively few Russians are visiting Iran , something of which the ambassador hope that it will change .
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , who have preserved the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said .
looking for witnesses : drinks market inf@@ ested in Wald@@ br@@ öl
a rob@@ ber@@ y @-@ raid was carried out on Thursday evening on the beverage store by Re@@ we XXL at Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber Street .
in the event of a fire@@ arm , three dark dressed people , who had per@@ ver@@ ted their faces , demanded the issuing of cash by the employee of the drink market and subsequently fled to foot and then presumably with a silver @-@ colored VW Golf .
the police do not share how much money has been exploited .
the perpetr@@ ators should have been between 1.@@ 60 and 1.@@ 70 metres in size , thus relatively small .
the drinks market is accessible and badly accessible from the parking deck of the Re@@ we market .
the perpetr@@ ators will have to flee towards Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and from the gravel parking space situated opposite the Park@@ haus@@ en@@ bahn , may be pl@@ ou@@ gh@@ ed with the silver @-@ coloured car , possibly in the direction B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) .
anyone who has made observations at the time of action ( around 7.@@ 45 pm ) , who are in connection with rob@@ ber@@ y , should urgently contact the police .
Nag@@ old : play and fun during summer holidays
eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and you@@ ths of the social ped@@ ago@@ gic daily group / social group work of the children &apos;s patron saint Nag@@ old with their supervis@@ ors during their summer holidays in Nuss@@ dorf , near Müh@@ lack@@ er .
during the first school holiday week , the joy@@ ous group was lod@@ ged in the quiet hard @-@ tw@@ alt@@ pits during the first week of school .
several full day excursions were on the agenda .
on the one hand , it went to B@@ rescue with the visit of the string zoo .
on the other to Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special children &apos;s guide in the world @-@ famous monastery .
the third trip led to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
in the Kel@@ ten@@ museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group learned a lot about the daily life and the food of the Cel@@ ts .
on the hot days , the group was delighted at the deep sea in Maul@@ bron@@ n , who invited for jumping , swimming and plan@@ ing .
children and care@@ gi@@ vers with their self @-@ prepared food such as the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ ätz@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ner Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English @-@ Breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese were culinary .
workshops were made , beautiful jewelry made of beads and stones or made of wood a Roman mill game .
other highlights of the free time were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings at the fire and the final &quot; Color@@ ful evening . &quot;
on the day of departure the sun laugh@@ ed and the children and young people returned to their home .
Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgrimage to the Do@@ or of Mer@@ cy
the ministers from the soul care unit E@@ yach@@ tal @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the way during a four @-@ day pilgrimage from Vil@@ lingen to Freiburg .
together , four stages were completed .
in order to bridge the time until the next Roman pilgrimage of all the ministers in the last two years , the District Church of Ministers of St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a several @-@ day pilgrimage .
various pilgrimage destinations have been tested and finally decided on the Epis@@ cop@@ al City of Freiburg , where this year , during the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , the portal of mercy offered to the Bishop of Freiburg in Freiburg was a special pilgrimage destination .
16 Min@@ is , of B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , and Gru@@ ene , and Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and the rooms of the saints , went their way .
in the evening , Fr . Stor@@ ost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration at St. Anna , blessed the Pil@@ gri@@ ms and distributed pilgri@@ ma@@ ges .
from Hor@@ b , by train to the starting point Vil@@ lingen , where also a Münster Un@@ ser@@ er Lieben Frau stands and so the Pil@@ gri@@ mage was taken from the Mu@@ en@@ ster .
the individual day tours were framed in the morning and evening , depending on a short impulse with various prayers , songs and texts .
but also on the way , the Min@@ is at field cross@@ ings , chap@@ els , or churches began to sing together a song from specially assembled pilgri@@ m songs .
the parish offices of the local par@@ ishes were available for the overnight stays .
at the stage targets Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller provided a tasty and well @-@ star@@ ving dinner and breakfast .
it continued on the second day about Fur@@ tw@@ angen in the direction of Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
the day after we reached the stage to St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting stretch of road , at first , some 500 metres of altitude had to be desc@@ ended and then climbed again .
the earned reward was a joint barbecue at Bad@@ wei@@ her in the evening .
after the morning pulse on the fourth pilgrimage in the impressive convent church of St. Peter , the final stage went to Freiburg .
visi@@ bly facilit@@ ated and happy the Min@@ is arrived in Münster in the afternoon and went through the gate of mercy .
with a little impulse God was thank@@ ed .
in the evening Mass in Münster the Min@@ is arrived at the pilgrimage destination by co@@ operator Markus O@@ bert .
after the divine service the pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar .
the next day was still time for the B@@ reis@@ gau metrop@@ ole .
in the afternoon we went by train back to Hor@@ b .

Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner held the last evening in the male team spr@@ int in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio for fame when the British team defended the London 2012 title .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anchor , which his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y had done to E@@ igen . the boy@@ friend made the legend proud when he stor@@ med home to win a victory from the favourites of New Zealand .
England claimed a shock@@ ing victory four years ago , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic med@@ als .
they repeated the trick after taking only a modest sixth place in March at the London run@@ way world champion@@ ships despite the withdrawal of Ho@@ ys .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the leader Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as a Hin@@ der .
Ho@@ y retired created a gap that Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cr@@ amp@@ ton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots , which now has un@@ folded .
Hin@@ der , Kenn@@ y - the four years ago with Ho@@ y victorious - and Sk@@ inner continued the qualifying laps in the qualifying laps , but in the standard rounds the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won in the first lap .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
Hin@@ der was barely back after his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it .
a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation , in which Hin@@ du drove in a higher gear to slow him down and allow Kenn@@ y and especially Sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y looked at his position as BBC expert and dropped Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der than they climbed onto the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m only here to do my best and make me a name .
we set up an Olympic ord in the final round and defeated the World Champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the 2012 triumph on the site of Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys , Hin@@ du admitted that after a weak start he intentionally dropped onto the track .
he later with@@ drew this statement and there was no objection to England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
with such an outstanding victory this time there was no such problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ der said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels like the whole GB of flags on the tri@@ b@@ une like London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have come together as a team during the last three months .
we have so badly carried away with so many world titles that it was unbelievable to win back at the Olympics .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation winning seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London .
if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress over the last five months , we expect successful five days in the Vel@@ od@@ rom .
with the form Kenn@@ y it &apos;s in the realm of possible that he won tes@@ ys win from three Olympic Gold Med@@ als in a contest .
that would be for Kenn@@ y - who was 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on March 23 ( a seemingly holy date for British sports ; on the day Steve Red@@ wood , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold med@@ als and a silver medal .
that would be the same as Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the spr@@ int that starts today and will go over three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only enjoy this for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a bit lonely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ der said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he wins two more gold med@@ als , he should be beaten to a k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll met the fastest performance in the four @-@ kilometer race .
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 at the destination .
the world record , which won gold in 2012 in London , was at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the competition where the focus will be on W@@ ig@@ gins .
yesterday he fought with commission@@ ers before the qualification , when officials called him to measure his body size .
in the corresponding women &apos;s competition , which will be continued and ended tomorrow , Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ sell S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e in world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the GB team relies on his strong railway team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to bring a thr@@ ong of med@@ als .
after a truly exceptional portra@@ yal of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio have been shut down .
there was drama in the background , so the res@@ ignation of Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton &apos;s technical director in April in the midst of sex and mo@@ b@@ bing alleg@@ ations as well as the retirement of size such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on .
however , if one looks at the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks as if the legendary reputation G@@ Bs , which reached its peak at the perfect moment , could be repeated again .
future of the melting shop of Port@@ land due to the lifting of the energy contract question@@ able
the future of the aluminium sm@@ el@@ ting of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ ing@@ men - are at stake , as the system operator announces the energy supply contract and that all supply contracts will be raised , as the supplying energy company ha@@ st@@ ened .
this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to operate the plant .
a subsi@@ dy for 20 years runs in November .
up to 2,000 jobs at the Al@@ coa Castle in Port@@ land are at stake .
no less than 2000 jobs - direct as well as indirect - could be at risk of closure .
in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effects since the melting shop consum@@ es around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Vict@@ ori@@ as .
in 2014 , Al@@ coa completed the point Henry enam@@ el , which led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea Kraft@@ werk last year .
the melting shop of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risks a closure .
this step follows the years of spec@@ ulation on the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and finally due to the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminum melt with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ ro@@ be Valley , announced that three other owners will announce their contracts .
the plant is owned by a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ G@@ eni Cor@@ p hold smaller shares .
&quot; AG@@ L believes that the plant in Port@@ land will continue to operate , which means a further physical demand for electricity by the melt , &quot; said the company .
AG@@ L still said that the contracts were so @-@ called &quot; hed@@ ging transactions , &quot; which should come into force in November 2016 .
the contracts have a 12 month notice period so that they will end 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts will contribute to revenue in the financial year 17 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the electricity supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential effects on the income on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale electricity prices .
AG@@ L announced that the value of the contracts had already been written down in the amount of $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; anticip@@ ation of termination . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Al@@ coa said that the decision to withdraw the contracts , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ co@@ as &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ability to operate the melt or to ensure the power supply to the melt is not impaired . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U.S. company said it had concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang , which would have come into force from November this year , even if it is still guilty of why it res@@ ig@@ ned from the contract .
analysts warn of the poor economic conditions in the industry before the possible closure of the Port@@ land mel@@ t@@ down in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle .
in reference to the analysts &quot; statements at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land uses around 600 meg@@ a@@ watts per year and around 900 MW of electricity a year .
should both systems disappear from the market , this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
and for us as a generator , this would not be good , &quot; he said .
more than just a car@@ das@@ hi@@ an reality TV star , Kendall is on the cover of the September issue of the Vog@@ ue
Kendall J@@ en@@ ner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an J@@ en@@ ner C@@ lans Kr@@ is is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September issue of the US Vog@@ ue .
Kendall , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and ran at the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on her Inst@@ ag@@ ram account .
&quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover brought me to tears , &quot; Bander@@ a .
the cover of the cover followed a bizarre ( or just keeping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans similar ? ) , critical reality video showing the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an J@@ en@@ ner family ( with the exception of Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n &apos;s most popular show bi@@ z unc@@ le and producers of Ke@@ eping Up R@@ yan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) , which ended with a classical twist : they all planned a surprise party .
this represents the stere@@ otyp@@ ed plot of nearly every birthday sep@@ tic of a children &apos;s programme ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; You thought we had forgotten you ? , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kr@@ is had to let her other girls participate in this public@@ ity somehow .
with regard to the September issue of the Vog@@ ue , surely a new era of the caravan has begun .
charming &apos;s big sister Kim likes her , as far as the Vog@@ ue cover is concerned ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West have been looking forward to see it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the journal is a league of itself .
the September issue is for Vog@@ ue the most popular issue of the year .
with a circum@@ ference resem@@ bling an illustrated book rather than a fashion journal , the issue is attracting a large number of adverti@@ sers ( Accor@@ ding to Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista the 8@@ 32 pages of the novel are 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) .
the revelation of his cover@@ star is so eag@@ erly awa@@ ited that in the last two years pictures of the magazine have le@@ aked out before the official announcement .
women already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and K@@ ate Mos@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years there have been clearly more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties , mod@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; models , celeb@@ ri@@ ties are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the cover &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oscar @-@ winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador J@@ enni@@ fer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013 , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honour .
but even with the small chance that Mrs. J@@ en@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of her generation - falls under the former category , she is in good company .
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous persons or reality stars or young people of today who know how to shoot a good Sn@@ ap@@ chat video ( even though everything applies to J@@ en@@ ner ) .
they are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had one of the most successful years of her career with the publication of Lem@@ on@@ ade .
of course , J@@ enny &apos;s success doesn &apos;t suit everyone .
with their reality TV history , J@@ enny &apos;s position in the fashion world was always ten@@ se .
in June , the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ Model Steph@@ anie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ en@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critici@@ zed and called them &quot; the bu@@ ggers of the moment . &quot;
these feelings came up again when the news came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vog@@ ue Cover .
but to get around on the mo@@ m seems to pass the point .
Kendall J@@ en@@ ner is on the cover of the September issue of Vog@@ ue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
she runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer by Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
they and all their sisters sell pictures of themselves on their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she sells her handmade pictures of Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ ford &apos;s daughter to the magazine W@@ TV .
and in her free time she is seen in reality TV . presumably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
community centers annually assign 16@@ 0,000 people each year
more than 16@@ 0,000 of the country &apos;s relief agencies are rejected every year by the community centers , while the industry insi@@ sts on the impact of further mid @-@ cuts on already over@@ loaded transactions .
in Que@@ ens@@ land , three out of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ just del@@ o@@ gi@@ ations and similar - are rejected in their request for free legal advice and legal assistance .
legal services of the municipality , which are already fully utili@@ sed , are ready for further cuts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; starting in June next year , these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Director of the community centers of Que@@ bec James Far@@ rel@@ l said that the last survey conducted by the National Association of Community Centre Centers yiel@@ ded that thousands of people have already been rejected every year .
Far@@ rel@@ l said the situation would only be worse without repe@@ aling the resolution of the Federal Government .
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s community centers are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , meaning thousands of people from important services that you need are rejected , &quot; he said .
people who rely on violent relations , people with insur@@ moun@@ table and op@@ pres@@ sive debts , families that have been released by separ@@ ations , workers who have been un@@ just@@ ly dismissed - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need .
from June 2017 , the Federal Government will cut the funding by 30 percent , which means that thousands of people in need from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call on the Federal At@@ tor@@ ney General and Federal jus@@ tiz@@ ers as well as Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately raise these short@@ cuts so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal assistance to the national average .
it is now time to look at the needs of the Community Centre and its customers , and that the Government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k inv@@ ests in this important work .
Donald Tru@@ mp Elec@@ toral Camp@@ aig@@ n accused of being ass@@ aul@@ ted weapon
new York : Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s campaign has been accused of alleged in@@ action after you have been informed that North Carolina &apos;s campaign leader has directed a fire@@ arm to an employee while travelling in a je@@ ep in February .
the incident is described in a bill of indictment , which was filed on Wednesday in the Charlotte Regional Court by Vincent B@@ ord@@ i , a former software programmer for the campaign in that state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ordin@@ i had been waiting for months to have waited for the matter to be settled internally before he realised that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this would not happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the leader of the campaign , Ear@@ l Philip , pulled a gun , put his right index finger on the trigger , and r@@ ammed the run in Vinc@@ ents Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; said B@@ ord@@ i in his indictment .
after compl@@ aining with the local and regional campaign leadership , B@@ ord@@ i stated that at least four other people had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he stated in the indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weapons must not be fired to do harm , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ ord@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the indictment was issued only two days after the Republi@@ can candidate had triggered a ri@@ ot when he said to a crowd in North Carolina that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; - fire@@ arm owners and arms friends - should take action if his rival had been elected to H@@ illary Clinton and appoint judges .
Tru@@ mp@@ s campaign clearly asser@@ ted that the media would have ri@@ pped his words out of context and that he would not turn into violence .
B@@ ord@@ is &apos;s complaint demands compensation from the campaign for violation of duty duty and Philip due to bodily injury and lasting psychological damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp@@ s Press spokesperson for Hope Hi@@ cks was not able to achieve a position . &quot; &quot; &quot;
attempts to contact Philip failed as well .
W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte , reports that Phil@@ lip is no longer a member of the campaign .
responding to calls at his consulting company , Innovative Consulting Services , has not been re@@ acted .
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp has so far conducted a controversial campaign .

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey before federal elections : losing the SPD and the CD@@ U
in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) there are considerable losses for the governing party SPD and CD@@ U .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this gave representative surveys of the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the red @-@ black government coalition in the North could just continue to go@@ vern , this is not possible after the survey values in Berlin .
but in both federal states , the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances to continue to head the head of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern the SPD fell from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent to 24 percent five years ago .
according to the survey , the party was only slightly ahead of the CD@@ U , which could return to 23 percent .
the third place is disputed between the left and the Af@@ D .
the left would come to 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented at 19 percent for the first time in parliament .
in spite of a slight loss of 6 per cent ( previous 8.@@ 7 percent ) , the Gre@@ ens are reluc@@ tant to return to the parliament &apos;s parliament .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ PD and F@@ DP were not represented in the Parliament with 3 percent each . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the survey , the SPD in Berlin would only come to 23 per cent ( 2011 election : 28.@@ 3 percent ) .
the CD@@ U only reached 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
it thus still lag@@ s behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
for the first time , the Af@@ D would be represented in the Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties at 14 percent .
with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , the pir@@ ates would not miss the move in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ mail and internet in slow motion : 20 years ago Nokia Communic@@ ator was on the market .
the success@@ ors dominate the world today - his maker experienced a disaster .
the device weigh@@ ed almost half a kil@@ o and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was thi@@ cker and bigger , therefore it was not good at hand .
on the contrary , it was rather cl@@ ums@@ y .
in the beginning , the built @-@ in memory used to be eight meg@@ ab@@ ytes , which would reach for about two sel@@ fies at high resolution today .
an iPhone is now shipped with at least 16 gigab@@ ytes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came to shops exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 - and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a few euros , fans can buy the appliances in the internet , but they somehow stem from the Stone Age of the internet era .
20 years ago , however , the Communic@@ ator was a sensation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ eb@@ it in Hanover &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; office in the west pocket format . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent and received for those standards a lot : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , also via fax the communic@@ ator was to be reached .
even access to web pages was possible via HTML @-@ browser , although slow .
a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be folded similar to a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen .
the price was quite proud : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , thus about 1400 Euros .
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
no one could suspect in August 1996 that the Communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything has changed .
the smart phones are a success story , although not for Nokia .
the F@@ innen cell division experienced an unprecedented disaster , was eventually sold and em@@ bro@@ iled to Microsoft .
today the market is domin@@ ating providers , all of which came much later than Nokia .
being online always and everywhere is today for a lot of people everyday life .
in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide .
sold around 1.4 billion devices , Samsung and Apple account for 5@@ 55 million copies alone .
worldwide sales with the equipment is around € 400 billion .
this includes the well @-@ running shops of the countless app providers and telec@@ om companies .
a whole industry has now emerged around the smartphone .
the decisive breakthrough to the mass market came only at the beginning of 2007 , at that time , Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones on Mac @-@ World .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an internet communic@@ ator , all with touch screen easy to use .
the trium@@ phant march of Apple began , and today the iPhone is the most important product of the company .
Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who dominated the market , had the look .
they finally van@@ ished , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the sa@@ wing now has Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention .
every German now looks at his mobile phone 88 times a day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must all learn to get the Smartphone away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , in charge of the Siemens Executive Board . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent availability is now considered a curse and a blessing at the same time .
England must ste@@ er the Olympic spirit and extend He@@ a@@ throw
He@@ a@@ throw will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country .
for me , it was the biggest attraction He@@ a@@ thro@@ ws , just like in 2012 in London , when we carried out a great effort to make sure all of our nations and regions benefited from the games .
the Olympics brought great benefits to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ a@@ throw .
we will provide 10.000 new apprentic@@ es@@ hips for our local communities alone , create 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment .
just as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who think that the challenge of extending He@@ a@@ thro@@ ws is too big .
I have been told that England will never be ready for games and that we will fl@@ ake up on the world stage .
the doub@@ ters had wron@@ ged in 2012 and they are going to be wrong even at He@@ a@@ throw .
there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ a@@ throw answers every asked question .
like the Olympic Games , He@@ a@@ throw is for many and not an infrastructure project .
expansion is a way to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion in entrepreneurial growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and in the UK .
we have a great team at He@@ a@@ throw , which has implemented a £ 11 billion &apos;s infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from the T@@ 5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , to the T@@ 2 , which was built in the midst of the two most frequ@@ ented walk@@ ways in the world .
now they are ready to provide a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment .
the 2012 London Olympic Games were a great success for GB and I am confident that He@@ a@@ throw &apos;s enlargement will also be one .
it is time for us to ste@@ er this Olympic spirit and bro@@ aden He@@ a@@ throw as well as secure future trade and create a legacy of skills and jobs that England can be proud of .

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; K@@ atz und Maus@@ spiel &quot; regarding ad blocking
&quot; &quot; &quot; for companies who earn money with online advertising , according to one of the software manufacturers attempts to circum@@ vent advertising block@@ ade , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cat and mouse game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , just two days after Facebook announced that it would block display block@@ ages on its desktop , Ad@@ block Plus published a blog post , in which it shared that users could update their filters in the program in order to again block advertising on the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook announced that his desktop site would change coding on its advertisements , to make it difficult to detect which part of the page is advertising .
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
in a blog post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams stated that &quot; this kind of h@@ in @-@ and @-@ fr@@ o struggle between the an@@ tim@@ el@@ ting open source community and the conver@@ sions has been in progress since the invention of indicator lamps , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has entered the battle is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying indicator block@@ ers have become for the industry .
according to a study from the last year of Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe some 200 million people use scor@@ ers ; almost four times as much in 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion daily users who access Facebook via their mobile devices , mobile advertising makes 84 percent of Facebook &apos;s advertising revenue .
the company has limited it to desktop PCs , since mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Facebook &apos;s mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ ag@@ ram , shared a spokes@@ man .
advertisement on desktop PCs consume a large portion of the revenue , so that Facebook appears to be worthwhile to invest such a step .
on Tuesday , Facebook announced that it would update its &quot; Ad Pre@@ fer@@ encing tool &quot; to give people more control over their adver@@ ts .
on Thursday Facebook claimed that Ad@@ block would cause new filters , because they would also block content on the site that are not advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the users this is not a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a Facebook spokes@@ man in an e @-@ mail message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad block@@ ers are a dum@@ b tool , which is why we focus instead on developer tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences in order to get more control over people &apos;s hands .
woman suspected of supposed suicide on Swiss motorway
the victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night .
the police call on witnesses after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday was over@@ run by a presum@@ ed suicide by several vehicles on a motorway .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a woman in the dark &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an act of despair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hit the street and were hit by several cars , the police told in Vau@@ d . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is obvious that a Swiss woman , at the age of 49 , who was transferred from several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself .
she died on the spot .
several drivers have already been heard , but some have still not been identified , said the police , asking these as well as every witness of the incident to report themselves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an investigation procedure has been opened , which is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; logical &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter shared with Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed .
was a collision avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two similar cases in the last five years show that the drivers will not be held ac@@ coun@@ table . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in each of the two cases - in which a person ran in the dark on the motorway - it was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian walks in the middle of the night on the highway as it was in the newspaper .
last year a polic@@ ew@@ oman was acqu@@ itted of the negli@@ gent murder after having crossed and killed a man who was lying on the A1 near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old sacrifice had drunk and became unconscious in the street , the court accepted .
the court found that the polic@@ ew@@ oman was forced to respond to an emergency call -- on a justified way and that the presence of a man on the streets was a &quot; perfect and unfor@@ es@@ eeable situation , &quot; said the judge .
anyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday near Morges , should contact the police at 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA air @-@ model : Venus was inhab@@ itable once
the Venus was probably inhab@@ itable according to the projections of a new NASA climate model .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies at NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resem@@ ble those of climate scientists .
the model was designed to determine whether Venus could once have er@@ d@@ allied conditions with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ tight atmosphere .
scientists have previously indicated that the slow turn of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation hints at the fact that Venus could have had a thin , er@@ d@@ like atmosphere and still slowly spinning .
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet probably referred more dry areas than de Earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to house life and protected from rapid evap@@ oration .
the early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow turn of Venus increases its day @-@ span of the Sun for almost two months , &quot; explained G@@ ISS Scienti@@ st Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release .
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the sun &apos;s heat .
the result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than that of the earth today .
the model produced a history of Venus that resembles the evolution previously suspected of planetary scientists .
although it was probably inhab@@ itable , Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light over the course of several billion years .
their oceans were evapor@@ ated and their water vap@@ or was blown away by ultra@@ violet light .
as their hydro@@ gen escaped only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide back with a fatal greenhouse effect -- Venus , which as we know it today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy returns as a trainer of the A@@ val@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy re@@ appeared on Thursday as a trainer and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che and led to low co @-@ determination in the decision @-@ making process of the team .
alternative president / general manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noticed that the association will immediately look for a new coach .
&quot; over the past three years , I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in an opinion .
during the summer , I thought about how I could improve this team to give it more depth , it needs it and bring it to a higher level .
in order to achieve this , the vision of the trainer and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations must be perfectly matched to the organisation .
he must also have a right to co @-@ determination in decisions that influence the performance of the team .
these conditions are currently not met .
Sak@@ ic , who had fired Roy on May 23 , 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick informed me today about this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we appreciate all he has done for our organization and wish him the best for the future .
during his debut season Roy has won the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Award as the best trainer in the league .
he took the club to 112 points and first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was beaten in the first round of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Pla@@ yo@@ ffs and missed the season in each of the last two years .
the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 stamp in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the Wild for a second wild@@ card spot at the Western Conference by five points .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart , Roy won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with Montreal Can@@ adi@@ ens and the A@@ val@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ pers resume talks , put on strike
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the labour disputes relating to wages for North Sea oil workers are being exposed , while all parties sit down for a new round of talks , said negoti@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot;
strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group were carried out spor@@ adic@@ ally to platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Wood Group as well as the Un@@ ites and the R@@ MT trade unions can confirm that we agreed to restart the resolution process of the current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated in a joint statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will hold several full @-@ day sessions over the coming weeks , which will start early next year to restart the problems .
the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
this year , Wood Group has cut the rates of its counter@@ parts in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the company has a 10 percent drop in on@@ shore procurement in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts give the company the required space to come through the market down@@ turn .
shell has dismissed thousands of people and announced plans to give up its oil and gas transactions in up to 10 countries , as it stream@@ lines its business activities as a result of its mega @-@ merger with the British energy company BG Group .
energy companies are under pressure because of lower crude oil prices , an economic situation that had stepped up through the decision of the British in June to leave the European Union .
the Scottish parliament , Dave Anderson , met with workers &quot; leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest industrial disputes that took place in the North Sea since a generation .
the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy that works for many and not only for a few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion will be expected for new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $ 7 billion over the past five years .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of stars in the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Space Teles@@ cope helped astronom@@ ers collect the most complete catalogue of rot@@ ational rates among the stars of the P@@ lei@@ ades cluster .
the new data help astronom@@ ers understand why stars in the star cluster rotate to different rates and in what context the rotation time periods are associated with planetary origin .
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other star cluster , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of its solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the cluster of stars of the P@@ lei@@ ades lies 4@@ 45 light @-@ years from the earth .
many stars in this cluster of stars , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , are now reaching adul@@ thood .
they are now turning the fastest .
at peak @-@ rot@@ ational rates these ri@@ pen@@ ing stars colli@@ de large amounts of star @-@ winds .
as these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars .
when a star is aged , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a visible star spot -- like sun@@ spots -- .
the latest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates indicates that more massive stars rotate more slowly than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with bigger stars slower pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller ones .
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades , we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be more massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; Reb@@ ull said .
since the cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rotation @-@ rats .
&quot; the cluster of stars of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , both younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
there is still a lot to learn about how , when and why stars slow down their rotation rates and hang up their &quot; dance shoes &quot; so to speak .
Reb@@ ull and their colleagues reported in detail on their latest analysis of the P@@ lei@@ ades rot@@ ational rates , which will soon be published in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
an Contro@@ versi@@ al Bas@@ eball Star joins
the tears ran faster at Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez faster than the US bas@@ eball star in the best days of Base zu Base .
following his emotional re@@ entry , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old professional will be wearing the jer@@ sey of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es on August 12 against the T@@ amp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m saying good@@ bye to Goo@@ db@@ ye , &quot; said the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star @-@ Game @-@ participant of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) .
three times Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was voted the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es .
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract gave him US $ 27 million annually since 2007 .
until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he will in future act as consultant and youth coach - with full salary .
as a player , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was paying back for a long time .
with 6@@ 96 hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 counts for his team ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Navy ( 1994 to 2000 ) , Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 he managed the Yan@@ ke@@ es some mil@@ estones .
with the Hall of F@@ ame members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys , only two more bas@@ eball players have similar values in the most important statistics .
however , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old is not likely to be included in the bas@@ eball hall of the basement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because so successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - was on the field , so disputed his appearance outside the place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; already in 2009 the super@@ star appeared on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; between 2001 and 2003 to have taken away forbidden ster@@ oids . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August 2013 , due to an involvement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal , he was locked up for 211 games by the end of 2014 .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered to be the main suspect for years through an anti @-@ aging clinic in southern Florida receiving funding .
after a law@@ suit , the lock was still reduced to 162 meetings .
&quot; the league could have done me a favor for 2014 , because I played for 20 years without a break , &quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said at that time swe@@ eter .
also his farewell @-@ days are not running no@@ is@@ elessly .
while many bas@@ eball legends occupy the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez frequently had to sit on the bench .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; my job involves trying to win any game , &quot; said Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di .
after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and to the relationships with Pop@@ star Madonna and act@@ ress K@@ ate Hudson , received sympathy for the fans of Yan@@ ke@@ e @-@ Erz@@ riv@@ al Boston Red So@@ x .
&quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od , &quot; sang the supporters at the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez team .
Olympia 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are the first dop@@ ing cases
well , because of a positive dop@@ ing test , weight lif@@ ters from Poland may not start from Poland in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing attacks .
a well @-@ known ath@@ lete would have won almost one medal .
before the seventh competition day , the first official dop@@ ing cases have become the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 metre high hur@@ ri@@ cane Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and the Polish weight lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were positively tested and excluded immediately before the start of the already critical Ath@@ le@@ tics competitions .
last Sunday , Ch@@ en had demonstrated the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ oth@@ i@@ azi@@ de , which is used as a mas@@ king agent for dop@@ ing substances .
the CA@@ S International Court of Justice confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon .
on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old took fourth place in the fin@@ als over 100 m of butterfly , only about 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medal .
on Friday , Ch@@ en had to take part in the courses of more than 50 m of fre@@ estyle .
the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) requested the opening of the B @-@ trial and a hearing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association takes the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very serious and demands Ch@@ en &apos;s full cooperation in the investigations &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will work with the International Women Court CA@@ S and will accept the judgment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history the IO@@ C is no longer in charge of the IO@@ C , but the CA@@ S for the sanc@@ tion of athletes with positive cases .
the news about the positive rehear@@ sal in Dan@@ ek@@ ova le@@ aked in the night of Rio , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went on the offensive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Bulgarian TV broad@@ ca@@ ster B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she is innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be nutritional supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the athle@@ tics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , it is supposed to act in the forbidden substance in order to treat the blood dop@@ ing agent EP@@ O .
Dan@@ ek@@ ova was pro@@ vision@@ ally suspended , according to B@@ NT the B @-@ sample should have already been positive .
Bulgarian Prime Minister Bo@@ y@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v immediately expressed his criticism of the subject matter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why athletes do not draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have already been expelled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , for example , all weight lif@@ ters from the nation &apos;s chron@@ ically dop@@ ing nation are not allowed to participate in Rio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; case was also known , the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg , like his brother Tom@@ as@@ z , had previously tested positive on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both can breed , however , both may not start in the class up to 94 kg .
before the start of the athletes , the Dan@@ ek@@ ova case is another heavy blow to the reputation of the whole sport .
the World Union IA@@ AF had banned the entire Russian team except for systematic dop@@ ing because of systematic dop@@ ing , even the Ken@@ yan L@@ äu@@ fer@@ nation produced numerous bad news in Rio .
in the swimming @-@ sport , the earlier suspici@@ ons in China also caused violent clas@@ hes between the athletes .
the Fren@@ ch@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Y@@ ang Har@@ sh .
&quot; sun Y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ elt li@@ la . &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium for more than 200 m of fre@@ estyle , I want to hand it over , &quot; Lac@@ our@@ t said in the French radio .
sun was also at the heart of an exploration of the Australian M@@ ack H@@ ort@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing fraud , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun had been positively tested in the Chinese champion@@ ships in 2014 on the stimul@@ ant tri@@ meth@@ azi@@ de , but only had to shut down a three month lock .
Dat@@ enk@@ lau : so per@@ fi@@ de black@@ mail her ran@@ som
programmer of black@@ mail malware is currently attacking businesses - and they are successful .
according to a recent survey by the malware defense specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes among 540 enterprises in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of sur@@ vey@@ ed companies were at least once in the past twelve months , sometimes multiple victims of an attack with black@@ mail software .
in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies were already the target of a ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail .
40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ran@@ som demanded by the perpetr@@ ators in order to be able to use the systems and data challenged .
the perpetr@@ ators speci@@ alize their black@@ mail software according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes enthusias@@ tically on attacks in corporate networks .
if they are successful there , the potential to black@@ mail is significantly higher than in private users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we currently watch a terri@@ fying rapid evolution of the malware , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes CEO Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2008 , most of the Mal@@ war@@ e@@ programs were still designed to send advertising .
then the perpetr@@ ators discovered black@@ mail software for themselves .
only private users were the target , but the change to corporate attacks took place in the past months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works following a simple pattern : once active on a victim &apos;s computer , it searches for unused files like Word , Excel or database files , as well as archives of images and videos .
these files encryp@@ t the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als last@@ ingly .
the software then presents the demands of the black@@ mail .
to get the final key code to the files , the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of cryp@@ to@@ currencies Bit@@ coin .
however , where the personal photo database is at stake in private users , companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases without which production stops .
accordingly , the damage is incurred when a ran@@ som@@ ware is struck .
22 percent of the affected German companies reported revenue losses through Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to completely dis@@ rupt business operation , in one case people were in danger of life .
several hospitals have already been victims of attacks in Germany , whose patients can be ac@@ utely threatened by the loss of medical records .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always tell the victims : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not pay , you only promote the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay , get their data back .
for managers it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetr@@ ators in the face of stand@@ still in operation .
the h@@ ack@@ ers in turn know this and try everything to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , the investig@@ ators of F @-@ Secure investigated the user interface and contact with the black@@ mail and come to the conclusion : the perpetr@@ ators actually attempt to build a kind of customer service to take more money .
they explain their victims through chat as they can pay via Bit@@ coin , set up freely accessible support sites or dec@@ r@@ yp@@ t vain for example files .
and when private min@@ ers are redeemed by a few hundred euro , companies have to negotiate heavily and pay five @-@ digit amounts to recover their data un@@ encrypted .
in view of the potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky gains from the ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , the h@@ ack@@ ers become more and more professional and share the work , explained safety expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from the antivirus provider SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware for roughly within a week . &quot;
however , it is more likely that these are three or four persons .
the programmers then sell their malicious software in the form of a software package to the actual black@@ mail .
the so @-@ called malware kit has been created by selling malware , advice and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between $ 1000 and $ 10,000 .
&quot; the scope of delivery includes an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski .
the black@@ mail then searches for more h@@ ack@@ ers to distribute the newly bought software among the victims .
we live in a service sector .
so one logs in one of the boards in the underground , bu@@ ys the set from a criminal and instruc@@ ts one more to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
payment is per certified calcul@@ ator .
&quot; usually the criminals then commission a sp@@ ammer with spreading , &quot; Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski declares .
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now well @-@ known for many companies that better protect their data .
over 50 percent of the companies IT managers in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes survey trust to rep@@ el Ran@@ som@@ ware by file @-@ back @-@ ups and scanner software .
accordingly , the perpetr@@ ators are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful measures , the perpetr@@ ators thre@@ aten to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes CEO Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , depending on the type of data , the potential for damage is much higher than before .
the perpetr@@ ators could also take completely new targets on the internet of things in the future .
at the Hack@@ er@@ konferenz , Def@@ con , security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat connected to the internet under their control .
in the middle of the winter , the activation of such a blocked heat could well be worth a ran@@ som .
if the perpetr@@ ators then instead of heating in the future block an entire production line in a factory , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0 .
one for all eventu@@ alities
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
in the small HR @-@ V , Honda wants to pack everything : a little SUV , a little cou@@ pe and even the versatility of a mini@@ van .
sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V seems rather small , the passengers have a lot of space both in the first row and in the rear .
the materials of the interior are well finished and have a pleasant effect , only the cockpit upper side is falling apart .
the HR @-@ V is more versatile than comparable vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is not only a boot of 4@@ 53 l and 10@@ 26 l for folded back rests , but there is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is less magical when it sounds : the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like Kin@@ os@@ essel and thus offer storage space , which is up to 1.@@ 24 m high from the floor to the ceiling .
the trunk can be loaded well , but the load height of 650 mm is slightly higher than in the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V very power@@ fully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
however , he is likely to make his work a bit qui@@ eter .
the daily consumption of 4.@@ 7 l / 100 km is gr@@ ati@@ fying .
there is another engine version : a 1.5 litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
a four @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynam@@ ism and comfort .
but the steering should be a bit more direct .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the equipment in the tested top version &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leaves nothing to be desired . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the security systems belong to the City emergency brake assist ( works up to speed 32 ) , the collision warning system and the lane keeping assistant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the collision warning sometimes irrit@@ ates because it evalu@@ ates many obstacles as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approaching objects &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high @-@ beam assistant works very reliably .
and the intelligent speed controller responds to traffic sign detection and th@@ rot@@ ates the speed if required .
the full connectivity is available only for the top features : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , navigation device , app integration and more .
two US@@ B@@ - and one HDMI socket lie beneath the arm@@ rest and are therefore somewhat cum@@ ber@@ some to achieve .
the approximately 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine .
those who don &apos;t want to invest so much will get the gasoline engine from 200@@ 00 Euro , the diesel from 23@@ ,000 euros .
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standard .
with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday car .
airline adher@@ es not : down@@ fall on passenger jet@@ ty
an airline is not liable for the down@@ fall of a passenger on the passenger jet@@ ty .
the Higher Regional Court of Düsseldorf ( A@@ Z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argued that liability is only conceivable in the case of haz@@ ards that are typical of air transport .
the plain@@ ti@@ ff had broken a knee of knee in the fall .
the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk of life , such as the court .
the airline had to pay no damages to the man .
case of disease : when the promot@@ er pays
those who get sick will only get money after they travel if the cause of the illness is beyond doubt in the hotel .
but this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests have shown the same symptoms .
in the case of a negotiated case , a family was severely affected by diarr@@ ho@@ ea and vom@@ iting on the second day of its doors .
she spent almost the entire vacation in the room .
their illness brought the vac@@ ation@@ ers back to a defective treatment plant that allegedly poll@@ uted sea@@ water .
the family thought that the trip had been flaw@@ ed with it - and compl@@ ained about the organizer .
in court , the plain@@ ti@@ ffs did not succeed .
indeed , the sewage treatment plant was indeed defective .
but the organis@@ er only learned about it shortly before the departure of the plain@@ ti@@ ffs .
he had to assume that the sea@@ water was al@@ right .
he did not viol@@ ate his duty of information , so the judgment .
especially since there were no im@@ puri@@ ties found in the samples of the water .
the condition of several hotel guests - possibly by con@@ ta@@ gion among themselves - belongs to the general risk of living .
of 6@@ 91 guests were only 38 .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère said , after the violence committed by refugees in Wu@@ erz@@ burg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people would have worried about further attacks .
the state must be possessed and decided at the same time to react to acts of terror .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our country will not answer the violence of the perpetr@@ ators with hate and sch@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this triumph we will not treat the terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a criminal would have to leave the country more quickly , this will raise the security and strength also the approval of the population for refugee policy .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère wants to achieve the implementation of the proposals until 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced another personnel strengthening of security forces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a medium @-@ four @-@ minute order of magnitude over several years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sympathy for terrorism must be punished again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
video surveillance should be improved , the weapon right is revised so that especially the purchase of weapons on the Internet will be more difficult .
the last much discussed duty of sec@@ rec@@ y for doctors should be maintained according to de Ma@@ izi@@ ère &apos;s words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , in dialogue with the medical profession , he wants to look for solutions to reduce the threat of citizens , he said with a view of mental ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to counter@@ act the radic@@ alization of refugees , the Minister considers a better social support necessary .
teachers need to be better prepared for dealing with traumati@@ zed people .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère plans the use of concealed investig@@ ators to prosec@@ ute criminals in specific areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about anything that contributes to further increase security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important that the Interior Minister spoke clearly against action . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was an ear@@ thing for the discern@@ ers in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gabriel said to the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke media group ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Ma@@ izi@@ ère had rejected calls from the Union following a bur@@ ka prohibition and the abolition of double nationality before . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he considers a general prohibition of full wear to be un@@ constitutional .
you can &apos;t pro@@ hibit everything you refuse , and I reject the wearing of the bur@@ q@@ a .
one can talk about rules about road traffic or for witnesses in court .
green boss Simone Peter accused the minister that he wanted to simulate with ever new anti @-@ terrorist act and act of action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ party leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fle@@ ets pro@@ verb@@ s and a tigh@@ tening of the right to stay bring people in this country no more safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
improved traffic flow at the motorway exit
it is regularly st@@ owed on the b@@ ypass road - here is a picture of November .
but this is to change : the legal remedy is to be prolonged .
this is a good news for all car drivers who are in traffic on the environmental street every evening in the traffic jam when they drive over the highway to Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
the road construction is extended on Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16th / 17th August ) in the area between Hammer road and the exit Wes@@ er Straße the right bending track by 700 meters .
drivers can then go directly from the hammer street to the right .
the big advantage : the traffic is divided early , whereby the entire course of the course is improved on the busy section of the federal road 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the district of Münster @-@ West .
the road nar@@ rowing on the feeder nerves the drivers especially between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
week@@ days from the back to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ h path and sometimes beyond .
the reason for this is the needle @-@ eye on the B 51 shortly before the exit Wes@@ er Straße .
from here , the traffic is directed only one lane by the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be built more than three @-@ four@@ ths ago .
the reason : static calculations revealed that the bridge no longer has the required load capacity to absorb the heavy @-@ load traffic two @-@ lane .
as long as this bott@@ len@@ eck and the connected traffic jam continue , the competent national company cannot say .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is time to reck@@ on with years because the bridge has an official remaining period of time until 20@@ 34 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the extension of the legal deviation , the state @-@ owned company deliberately chose the weaker period during the school holidays because it was to be reck@@ oned with disabilities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the traffic will be passed on the building site on Tuesday and Wednesday .
intercultural journey : cultural activities for schools
&quot; &quot; &quot; the international class of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wald@@ schule &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; visited the play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The In@@ visible House &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theatre are now planning a music project .
N@@ ima &apos;s association enables young people with migration and refugee backgrounds to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; class International &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule children &apos;s home has visited an idea of the award @-@ winning play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The In@@ visible House &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the boy Theater Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; initiated by the organisation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 19 students between 11 and 15 years attended the production in the small house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims at the cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee background , offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster in the context of this project .
most people in the class have come to Münster in September 2015 and March 2016 , including Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria and speak little German .
thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic images and video animations it was possible for them to follow the course of action nevertheless , thus the press release of the boy theater Münster .
N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr Tann@@ az West@@ er@@ berg , is a voice , and the Junge Theater will collaborate in the coming season as part of a musical theatre project .
from October to December youth with and without refugee and migration background will be given the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing , dance , acting and music .
offers for children and families in the field of theatre play and theat@@ rical language mediation are planned .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; continues .
in view of the increased number of refugees , the association counts with many classes who want to participate .
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for improved weather
the weather has made the shooting star Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the south west of Germany a bar through the bill at night - but there is still hope .
the night was bad for clouds and rain to observe the heavenly spectacle , the chairman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , said on Friday morning .
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather should be good , then we see many shooting stars in the sky .
the shooting stars are per@@ pen@@ ds , which are one of the fastest shooting stars with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour .
they have their names , because they seem to come from the con@@ stellation of Per@@ se@@ us , which rises in the north @-@ east .
relaxing N@@ ights : tips for Sle@@ ep Dis@@ orders
in the evening you roll yourself around forever , at night you lie awake for hours , in the morning you can no longer think of sleep before the wake up .
this is anything but relaxing .
after all , one is in good company with such problems : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of the adult sleep problems and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently than not relaxing .
how do sleep problems or sleep disturbances manifest ?
there are several forms of sleep disorders , and many causes may be based on them , says Hans @-@ Günter B@@ ake , member of the board of the German Association for sleep control and sleeping medicine .
but what one understands pro@@ vision@@ ally , however , is the in@@ som@@ nia , that is , an in@@ som@@ nia disorder .
especially the sleeping experience affects many people as uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , says Jens Wagen@@ kne@@ cht , member of the board at the Deutsches Haus@@ Diagnos@@ te@@ gemeinschaft with practice in Var@@ el , Lower Saxony .
what is behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
behind it can contain organic , mental or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also medicines .
not in@@ frequently the sleep problem is an expression of another condition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early w@@ aking is most common in depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says We@@ ak . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that different factors condition each other .
who , for example , has a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , can lie poorly , w@@ akes up every two to three hours and possibly starts to p@@ onder@@ ing about everyday problems and worries , there is an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should I become a doctor with sleep disorders ?
those who don &apos;t sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and are affected in the day should go to the doctor , throw the blast .
the impair@@ ment can look quite different : one is tired , tired , sleep@@ y , has difficulties with the attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical ail@@ ments such as stomach or head@@ ache .
to allevi@@ ate your sleep distur@@ b@@ ance , it is important to find out their causes .
treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy , or medicines - classical sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in@@ quired .
Dr. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary dormit@@ ory medicine center of the Char@@ ité Universitäts@@ medizin Berlin , is hardly available in Germany .
this is why you should contact the family doctor in case of sleep problems .
this can be clari@@ fied by examining whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep lab and what happens there ?
for the examination in the sleep lab , doctors advise doctors , for example , in snor@@ ing with respiratory set@@ ters , in case of sickness @-@ like fatigue , for sleep transform@@ ers or if the cause of a distur@@ b@@ ance distur@@ b@@ ance fails , Fi@@ etze explains .
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please do not make a n@@ ap , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after glu@@ ing , you go to bed at its normal time .
besides the electrodes on the body , one carries a nose g@@ og@@ gles , a chest strap and a fe@@ eler at the finger .
in addition , a camera on the ceiling is indic@@ ative of sleeping .
how can suffer@@ ers get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a lot of adjusting screws where you can sleep for better sleep .
whether you sleep in bed , do not sleep long in bed , do not sleep on the day , avoid alcohol , and don &apos;t look at the watch at night - then you start to count immediately , and that &apos;s not condu@@ ci@@ ve to it .
what the jungle camp has to do with missing med@@ als in swimming
the former German float Markus Dei@@ ster has commented on Facebook for dis@@ ap@@ pointing cutting of the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 , he took gold for the first time at the World Cup ships in Doh@@ a and at the same time presented his first world record .
now , the former DS@@ V @-@ ath@@ lete Markus Dei@@ tem@@ eyer was prot@@ esting against his ex @-@ team @-@ colleagues in front of his ex @-@ team @-@ colleagues .
&quot; in a country where an Olympic champion receives 20,000 € bonus and a jungle King 15@@ 0,000 € should not be surprised about missing med@@ als , &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on his Facebook page at night on Friday .
the funding system in swimming is bad , whereas dop@@ ing controls , on the other hand , are very good .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that we cannot compete with countries that promote very much and do not see exactly where dop@@ ing is concerned , or even operate it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls should be set here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , Dei@@ ster had to be registered for nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) .
this is exactly how it should be held with countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you cannot control a certain time before WM / OS from independent controllers of WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A , you must not take part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; demands the choice ham@@ burger , who meanwhile runs an ice cream . &quot; &quot; &quot;
airport : Ban@@ de of Bag@@ gage Acc@@ ep@@ ted
professional thi@@ eves at Düsseldorf Airport
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civilian investig@@ ators of the Düsseldorf police managed to capture two women and two men aged 50 to 61 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the susp@@ ects had committed several bags and baggage ste@@ els as a gang .
at 9.@@ 30 p.m. civil servants in the area of Düsseldorf Airport recognised a gang that was known to polic@@ emen of past theft victims .
the two women and two men had committed several off@@ ences since the middle of July of this year and have been com@@ mon@@ place , labour @-@ friendly and especially professional .
the specialists of the det@@ ective bure@@ au 34 can demonstrate four acts , which were submitted specifically for the off@@ ence of criminal off@@ ences to Germany .
at the same time , they had exploited about 15,000 euro .
old buildings , some lin@@ den trees , occasionally a rest of cob@@ ble@@ stones : the Riga street in Berlin @-@ Friedrichsha@@ in looks not like at first sight , but the police counts them to the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
if one goes along the road from east to west , one passes through play@@ grounds , a fres@@ ch @-@ painted kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ades .
&quot; &quot; &quot; someone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has spra@@ yed on the façade of a grey house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
opposite a Li@@ dl , which will soon be demoli@@ shed , is already built : by 2017 , a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here .
articles about this &quot; trendy neighbourhood , &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrichsha@@ in calls , are , however , preferred in recent weeks with burning cars .
reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents have rent contracts , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events .
especially the Berlin inner sen@@ ator handle had spoken several times for a hard action by the police against the project since the beginning of the year , the area as a &quot; no @-@ go zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence .
after having been evacu@@ ated on June 22nd , the premises on the ground floor , the ca@@ det s@@ mi@@ ths , with 300 police officers , had pat@@ rolled out official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site , locked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94 .
meanwhile , on behalf of the unknown home@@ owners , the building workers renovated the rooms .
on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court ruled that the clearance had been illegal , and a day later , police and construction workers reloc@@ ated under the jubil@@ ation of sympath@@ is@@ ers and residents .
on this afternoon the street looks peaceful : parents go for a walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others enter@@ tain themselves in late late afternoon .
in the immediate vicinity of the house projects there is a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens .
left violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has lived in the neighbourhood since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who has three children here since 1999 , is particularly anno@@ yed by the police presence .
with the inhabitants of the house projects , they share the concern for rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
it does not sound like a Kie@@ z , who mostly wanted police protection against v@@ and@@ alism .
the tren@@ ch , which the Berlin interior sen@@ ator and the police have between the occup@@ iers and their neighbors , apparently does not exist .
in the east of Berlin , Friedrichsha@@ in was actually a traditional workers &quot; quarter , which also has a low average income and a high risk of poverty in comparison to the rest of the city .
in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including nearly all Main@@ zer Straße in the vicinity of the R@@ ī@@ ga .
while the Main@@ zer was evacu@@ ated under large police command in a regular street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in Riga and are still inhabited by the people they occupied 26 years ago .
at the same time , the district has become increasingly magnet for tourists and elec@@ tive Berlin@@ ers from all over the world over the last few years : now residents from GDR times and former home occup@@ ants share their neighborhood .
this is also noticeable in the r@@ ents that have risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009 .
many of the new buildings in the R@@ ī@@ ga are being attacked as symbols for this development : one recognizes them on the dra@@ ined windows or freshly painted facades , which were thrown with color bags .
no other street was mentioned this year together with the words &quot; left autonomous power . &quot;
one reason for not all neighbours to consider this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crimin@@ ality : according to statistics , criminal off@@ ences such as bodily injury are almost exclusively directed against police officers .
most of the off@@ ences do damage , which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses .
there can be no question of uncertainty for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a ten@@ ant near the disputed 94 for 17 years .
as far as violence is concerned , it is appe@@ ti@@ zing : the people in the 94 are their neighbours who were certainly not .
even the famous burning cars are no longer available right away in Riga .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the architect , her street is not a criminal focus , on the contrary : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here one helps one another , lives together on the street and gets more of each other than elsewhere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer has deliberately drawn into the street of Riga - and has remained .
that is why it was so important that the residents got back their streets : from the police , politics and the media , who all of a sudden claimed the deut@@ ungsh@@ oh@@ eit across the district .
but in the eyes of the inhabitants like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road continues to be taken away : through fac@@ eless re@@ constructions in former buildings , which disp@@ lace the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are property @-@ style apartments that are not interesting for many - here are rather people who are not so well searched , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I absolutely cannot appro@@ ve violence and destruction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what to do if someone never list@@ ens to someone ?
there is fru@@ stration on all sides , even with the police and the inhabitants .
for newcom@@ ers who fre@@ t about color bombs , Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the house projects and the left @-@ hand scene belonged to the neighbourhood .
those who come from should be aware of this - just like someone who moves into a pub , can complain badly there about noise .
all persons presented with first names have asked not to be named with their correct name .
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is a new Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person in matters of integration and organizer .
she is also a social worker on site .
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the Refu@@ gee Commissioner for Ur@@ bach since July .
the social ped@@ agog@@ ue supports the team of the Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger administration .
she sees herself as a contact person for all actors : refugees , working group , refugee aid , administration , authorities and anyone else involved .
Reg@@ ine customer of the working group indicated that the volunteers are more than thank@@ ful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the uns@@ killed Woll@@ m@@ ch@@ sau , who has a problem above all .
in this way , some - less spot@@ less than on the multitude of demanded tasks - meant that the administration wanted to leave the place .
looking for an administrative professional with a talent for languages and people , combined with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , just a cutting @-@ down Woll@@ m@@ ch@@ sau .
but administrative work is not its central area , says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
first of all , it is about organization , work with local people and also behind the scenes as well as networking activities .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has a 50 percent stake in three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was high time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports honest and full @-@ time players . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are big and minor problems , organizational , human and communication problems .
soon new containers are available at Was@@ en@@ straße
a serious problem has been , for some time , to find apartments for the connecting flights that have been recognized .
the municipalities are responsible for the connection provision .
you must place the refugees in their own or rented apartments .
the costs of the construction , rent or renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the commun@@ es themselves .
the responsibility changes from the district council to the Commune and Job@@ centers .
problem : there are free objects , but not every owner wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been very difficult for some time now .
in fact , administration does not find any private apartments .
so far , it does not work , so be instructed on private dwell@@ ings , says Deu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , common dwell@@ ings must be in@@ famous as it is so beautiful .
so soon new containers will be set up in the Was@@ en@@ straße .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree .
in addition to a permanent residence , there are intern@@ ships , apprentic@@ es@@ hips , school grounds , one @-@ euro jobs and support activities for refugees and migrants who need to be repaired or furnished .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer .
many work in the building yard or help home@@ masters , do non @-@ profit work - and that motiv@@ ates and very ti@@ dy , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
she hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no occupational therapy &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but activity does not only mean work .
the day needs a solid structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and client .
people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
so it needs offers such as sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses .
professional courses are rare .
so also jump here Administration and Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers .
it is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
they have to explain to the refugees that it takes time and they can bridge the time sensi@@ bly , for example with language courses .
those who develop the feeling at some point can &apos;t help in Ur@@ bach , do not work and be useless , he will never integrate .
the clear majority was motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are also problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says customer hon@@ estly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people with whom nothing goes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always also motiv@@ ating others . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; all this is already a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mamm@@ oth task &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a difficult question : do the two have fear of radic@@ alization after the recent events , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer quite clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what some nai@@ ve call &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ sed .
these incidents are also the topic of refugees .
they would have the fear that the assass@@ ins were completely dis@@ car@@ ded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so main and volunteers must look for activities locally and in the region .
they always have in the background that a new shock to refugees and migrants might soon come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a upper limit ?
to answer this question clearly , politics abh@@ ors itself .
actually it is unfair to put them on site .
&quot; in Ur@@ bach , we have not yet arrived where we want to go , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
no new refugees , that would relax the situation .
Reg@@ ine customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bach is already busy with it , to integrate the existing people sensi@@ bly .
these are currently around 100 people , mostly young men .
but if people are in need , they have to help them , both women agree .
the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers .
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : looking for intru@@ ders with helicop@@ ters
the police helicopter flew around for about an hour - un@@ successful .
two unknown men were forci@@ bly entered into an apartment in a multi @-@ family house in the Lin@@ den@@ weg on Friday morning at 8.@@ 50 a.@@ m .

the two men were about 1.@@ 65 to 1.@@ 70 meters tall , probably mas@@ ked , they wore blue jeans and black hoo@@ die pul@@ lis .
they fled towards the city center .
