<seg id="3">At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer was looking for a bit of diversion with a ride on the beach with some colleagues.</seg>

<seg id="10">On Saturday, Germany's best golfer of all time - 101 drops of tournament - was again near horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">He had his family run over the estate of the ALRV, and on a horse he didn't even bother for photo purposes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Long was the first time in Aachen and therefore also at the CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German sports help handed the man from Anhausen within the scope of a small gala the Golden Sportpyramide.</seg>
<seg id="15">The sympathetic sportsman is not lacking in awards.</seg>
<seg id="16">Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silbernes laurel leaf, Champions-Tour-Player of the year...</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen has already rebuked him.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clinton's and Trumps economic policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">"" "" "" "investing in infrastructure and preventing TTP trade agreement - both Clinton and Trump want to do so." ""</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two U.S. presidential candidates are not at odds with tax and energy policies, as well as in a fundamental issue.</seg>
<seg id="4">The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton constitute a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">Der, about the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "trump is in doubt rather small and warns against how the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulations." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and to regulate death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, claimed Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "he will decline regulations greatly, and he is making himself strong for far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private persons and for companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton said: the state has certain tasks to accomplish, it has disadvantaged opportunities to open up and needs money.</seg>
<seg id="11">That is why the taxes for the rich would increase, they say.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the topic infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In reality, Trump and Clinton say almost word-like.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate has even announced the biggest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state-critical party party of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">On the other hand, there could be internal discussions on turmp.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "the differences in energy and climate policy are more evident." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump plans to build coal-fired power stations and boost coal mining in the US again.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas, and wants to terminate the Paris Climate Protection Agreement.</seg>
<seg id="20">Clinton, on the other hand, wants to expand and demand renewables with her investment program: "a country will become the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "it will be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far apart.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transposfic trade agreement, do not want to sign.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, however, both want to not isolate the US from international trade - but simply protect American jobs better.</seg>
<seg id="25">They should then be paid better, Clinton demands.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a wage.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump wants to do on this matter is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage has to rattle, then he says he must not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "but the big discussion of the coming months would probably be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "" "" "on the one hand is Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth." ""</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics point to him that the budget deficit would be even greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand Clinton, who at least wants to demand from the rich wants to pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution either.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and announce an official end of the eight-month-long war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot deny that Ankara wants this reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile was impacted and he barely radiated warmth, even for his restrained circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke of his" "" "dear friend" "" "Putin - according to a report whole five times." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but can even be improved.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan had behaved as if there had never been anything worse.</seg>
<seg id="11">It seemed to me that his enthusiasm was rather the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's emanating, sustainable coolness showed that Russia's head of state had nothing to forget.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the shooting of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was furious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin dealt and accused Ankara of falling into the backs of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">The offence was even bigger since it was committed by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">To restore the veto will be difficult, if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months state-controlled media carried out a fierce, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">Suddenly it seemed as if the Turks would blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">Most serious were the accusations of senior officials that Erdoggans would have benefited their own family from illegal oil trade in Syria which is controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He vehemently denied this.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse from President Erdogan, who he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are obvious.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan urgently needs all the friends he can get after he has been relieved of his ministry last month at a failed state empire.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shocked him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey severely - in particular the ban on charter flights which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, travel agents and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late seasonal rush to the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, the state TV projected cheap fruit and vegetables once the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "a report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows:" "" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is furious on the West as it regards its response to trying to seize power as a weak answer.</seg>
<seg id="38">This includes continuing grudge over the snail pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is anxious to benefit from the cool atmosphere and to reduce the relationship between Turkey and the West.</seg>
<seg id="39">In Ankara, the Russian chief of state won a bonus that he demanded support for the elected authorities after the attempted coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is a matter of course for Moscow that has a deep fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit meeting in this brilliant palace at the sea made it possible for Russia and Turkey to present an "alliance of outsiders" to me as an analyst: two countries that violate the West and feel badly treated and now faint.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still big differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently given its role as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents mentioned at the press conference that they did not even touch the subject.</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey intentionally avoided answering a question of their differences, while Putin decided to stress this.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster than NATO member Turkey fired on the Russian military jet - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State speak at least once more.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russian Putin firing staff head Sergei Ivanov</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly released his head of staff Sergei Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">IVANOV was part of the strict confidence circuit of Putin for many years.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for Environmental and Transport Affairs.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "in a statement by the Kremlin, it reads that without giving reasons, Putin said" "" "the release of Ivanovs from his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who has been a deputy since 2012, was named his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious State Moscow Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in Tokyo's Embassy in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the website of the Kremlin it is said (in Russian) that he later was the head of the clerk and chief of the staff.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "he said about his appointment as Putin:" "" "thank you for your confidence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "I think it is the government's main duty to support your activity as head of state in regards to draft laws and inspections to implement your instructions." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin told the Russian TV broadcaster on Friday that Ivanov was asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Are the smiling faces convincing?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">For a long time Seryozha Ivanov was one of the closest confidants Vladimir Putin and works like he for the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin broadcast on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff resigns at his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smiles for the cameras, a few of them are convinced, especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So is the consequence of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this at present.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official statement - that a man who once was promoted as a potential president - at once would like to direct Russian environmental policy - pushed for great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks to Putin, cited on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said: "it's true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 to give me this very complicated post - you could almost say - entrust my job for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV accepted the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Prior to that, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and how Putin is a former member of the KGB State Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the German Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin reached power he called Ivanov one of five people whom he trusted most.</seg>
<seg id="29">It was once believed that after Putin's second term of office, Ivanov could become President of Russia since a third term of Putin had violated the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another allies of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before he became president three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1.35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017</seg>

<seg id="4">"" "it is the first of four closure of the" "" "ceiling blower" "", "which is approaching completion by each of the three towers of the bridge." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The bridge-section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30.000 tons.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 slanted cables.</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Economy minister Keith Brown paid a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "he said," "" "This is an historical and symbolic moment when building the Queensferry crossings." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic degree in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel, which were used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for the fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">Overall, almost 79% of the total deck is at their place and the last part of the deck is getting a concrete shot for the deck in Rosyth, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Chain Constructors said:" "" "the first shutter represents a significant milestone for each bridge project." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">This fantastic project represents the closure of trendsetting high and low construction.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the northern tower on the northern tower, we had to close the existing gap in the north or north side of the country.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was reached 700 millimeters south by pulling the northern feeder bridge.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massive because the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at a slope of about 3%.</seg>
<seg id="19">Delicate since the tolerances on which the team worked were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimeters thick.</seg>

<seg id="1">Who builds up cheap apartments from Braunschweig?</seg>
<seg id="2">The SPD and the Green Group are saying: in the future, investors should be taken much more seriously.</seg>

<seg id="4">"" "the SPD will propose a" "" "Living Room" "" "for the next session." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">But strife is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First of all, it is about the question: who is supposed to build the cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "said S & D Group president Christoph Bratmann comments:" "" "we agree with the Greens: whoever wants to build on urban areas must in future reject 20 percent of all apartments as social housing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">The favorable apartments can, however, also arise in the continuance.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "however, the big dispute in the town hall is," "" "How do you deal with investors who want to build on private areas?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "we want investors to build at least 10 percent of these areas, but as much as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">A new housing construction programme, which will cost millions and still needs to be financed, is to provide incentives.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "the problem, so Bratmann:" "" "there is currently no agreement between the factions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants investors to set up as few regulations as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Left wants even harder jobs for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">In spite of this, so Bratmann, a sharpening of the situation on the housing market opens.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the concept of action is implemented, this will take care of additional tasks in the building management.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the programme is not yet complete: the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.</seg>
<seg id="21">But how do you reconcile the loss of other around 1300 advantageous apartments, whose funding will expire in the coming years?</seg>
<seg id="22">There will be 500 homes by 2020 alone.</seg>
<seg id="23">In order to prevent this, as the planning policy spokesperson Nicole Palm, now expiring links should be purchased from the city.</seg>
<seg id="24">In addition, it would have to be thought about getting the apartments back into the price relationship.</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the western city.</seg>
<seg id="26">The problem could be solved in one fell swoop.</seg>
<seg id="27">Because in the western city, Fristen will run out at the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments could be brought back into the price range for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: this does not mean the owners, the apartment construction companies.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because the number of social housing in the western city is dramatically increased, one removes itself from the goal of so-called confusion.</seg>
<seg id="31">There should be no more concentration of socially disadvantaged people in just a few parts of the city.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens count on the fact that there will be movement in the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "s & D Group president Holger Herlitschke comments:" "" "for a broad majority, the CDU must go on board." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">The focus is on more building sites for single-family homes.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that is worth</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see how the world is changing.</seg>
<seg id="3">The fact that teenagers and children are no longer going out to play outside, but rather prefer to spend their leisure time staring on screens has been complained by many over the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then videogames and most recently on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is therefore great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not mutually exclude each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">I refer, of course, to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters created for the video games in the 1990s (later a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs were created.</seg>
<seg id="8">As many phenomena of pop culture, interest in the publication of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand declined in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that the server overloaded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users as Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, the players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pokemon that are tracked with a GPS and once they have been found, they can be "photographed" (via a screenshot on the mobile phone) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the turkey and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "in the U.S., the game led to a considerable rise in steps that the" "" "average" "" "person recounts every day." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardipole, an app for Apple Watch, followed by 35.000 users, announced the Washington Post recently that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of subsequent people who exercise every day 30 minutes, from 45 percent jumped to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data to improve performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "many public health awareness campaigns that people want to" "" "take 30 minutes" "", "" "" "coming from the sofa" "" "and" "" "being active every day" "" "blew on deaf ears because many public messages are dull to health and come from people who look miserable." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">However, the importance of sports cannot be overvalued.</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who regularly exercise sports will reduce their chances of getting cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something in the open air that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus, three pillars of health are covered - exercise, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even close friendships on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always there are also gruesome game destroyers which always have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could walk against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What is it supposed to be?</seg>
<seg id="27">A breakthrough happened.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if Smartphone-Apps like Fitbit were able to track our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to play sport as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its charm and the use will be followed by time.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, due to Pokemons's success, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activist in the real world, helping a lot of people in the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="7">Breathtaking on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="8">Brilliant on whole line.</seg>
<seg id="9">And now finally Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="10">The 19-year-old American gymnast melted on Thursday to the multi-campaign title, enlarging the gap between herself and the rest of the world before all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">Her overall score of 62,198 was clearly before the Silver medal winner and "Final Five" team cameradin Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medalists Aliya Mustafa.</seg>
<seg id="12">The American women Simone Biles turnt on the brimbar during the individual multi-campaign female of women at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="13">Biles is the fourth heterosexual American, who wins a multi-campaign title and in total the fifth, while holding her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">She burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment ended.</seg>
<seg id="15">This success is in the same league as unique athletes such as Michael Phelps, who have brought their sports into new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Billy has dominated the sport in the last three years, including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou Rescue from her said that she is "the best gymnast I've ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="17">It awaited her last test in Brazil, a competition that was not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas, would be considered a disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Americans Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace each other once they have won gold and silver in the single multi-battle female of women at the 2016 Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday</seg>
<seg id="20">Billy took the first medal on Tuesday, while she served as an exclamation mark on the farewell party of retired team coordinator Martha Karolyi.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although Biles insisted on having never planned the future, it is not true.</seg>
<seg id="22">Part of their floor exercises - containing their typical tumbling pass - is matched to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the OlympiaArena in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is no accident.</seg>
<seg id="24">This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a small child and was discovered by trainer Aimee Boormans mother during a school excursion to the gymnasium where Boorman trained, became a force.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since the summer of 2013 she has no longer lost a competition, a series of victories that will stop as long as Biles wishes.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even though Mustafa was easy through two turns, the picture was murdering.</seg>
<seg id="27">Brigbeams and ground bases - in which Biles keeps the world title track - lautered.</seg>
<seg id="28">She picked up again with 15,433 on the floating bar - and put another on top with a 15,933 on the floor.</seg>
<seg id="29">Raisman hugged her softly as they expected her envy - a pure formality - and tears flowed onto Billy shiny red, white and blue Eyeliner, when the vision she once described in her book book became a reality.</seg>
<seg id="30">Raisman's performance was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place, but the bronze medal went to Mustafa in a tiebrake.</seg>
<seg id="31">This time the 22-year-old team captain, who is called "grandma" by the Americans, had a lead.</seg>
<seg id="32">After their ground exercise, she threw Kusshausen to the public, overwhelmed by a comeback, which sometimes appeared dubiously.</seg>
<seg id="33">As for Biles, the rapidly spreading tweeter of the 19-year-olds has a completely new meaning at the beginning of this week:</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I imagine under the women's olympihood in gymnastics and that is more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First of all, since 1984 I have been part of every summer Olympics and the USA has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And second, this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspired many young girls from other skin colors.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jewess and Madison Koywheel, which is catholic, makes everybody proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years, the number one among female Turneresses was an American-American.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were.</seg>
<seg id="10">That shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America cheered.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple World Championship in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they delivered unexpected, but masterful gyms routinely.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone became the fourth, heterosexual American, who won gold at an individual multi-campaign event.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the top of this sport, but we do not see sports classes throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie all hit the same path as Aly and Madison to get it into the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "they are the" "" "Last Five" "", "because the next Olympic team will have only four gymnasts in the team. furthermore, the last year is Marta Karolyi as a trainer." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality is that gymnastics are expensive sports and gymnasts are primarily in private trainers, which are maintained by parents who pay for training, setup, travel clothing, competition and hotel costs (for trainers and their gymnasts and families).</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these turnaround are in prosperous suburbs that can support business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs, gymnasts get their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have both trained their athletes since they started doing gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to allow the churches to be inspired by innumerable, young girls, who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, a more affordable and easy-to-reach gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my gym of 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">In my events, we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban youths (especially black and hispanic) and trained national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer youth high-quality gymnastics, which deserve the opportunity to learn and profit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers life-long benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team, bringing thousands of young girls interested in gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sport, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thanks to Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real presentation of "Girl Power" thanks to the Holen of the Olympic team golds and thanks, so many young girls were motivated with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="2">The ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by accepting a reformed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association but 58 percent of the 37.000 assistance doctors who voted in a vote rejected him.</seg>
<seg id="3">In July Hunt plans to introduce the treaty and said that the NHS would be in a "no man's land" and any further delay would be detrimental to the employees and patients.</seg>
<seg id="4">The first assistance investigators shall receive a new contract, which includes changes to night and weekend courses to improve care for unrelated times.</seg>
<seg id="5">Dr Ellen McCourt, the president of the BMA committee for assistance investigators said last night in a communication with: "assistance investigators still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will heat the current staff crisis and take it to meet all doctors."</seg>
<seg id="6">With only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors falls under the new contract, progress has to be made and time runs out.</seg>
<seg id="7">Efforts on the part of the BMA to resolve disputes by conversing with the government for a reluctance to participate and sometimes silence at a deafening silence.</seg>

<seg id="12">The ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by accepting the reformed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association.</seg>
<seg id="13">The BMA would like to receive a better weekday pay for the 54,000 resident doctors who are subject to the contract.</seg>

<seg id="2">Thousands of heart attacks patients will benefit from a £2-per day medication after being recommended by the authorities to administer this more people for a longer period of time.</seg>
<seg id="3">The anticoagant medication Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease.</seg>

<seg id="6">The NICE Regulatory Authority recommended a four-year long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.</seg>
<seg id="7">Around 140,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer from another heart attack or stroke.</seg>
<seg id="8">Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulations of fatty material in the artery walls that form bellows.</seg>
<seg id="9">When the floorcovering breaks apart, it can cause a blood clot which stops the flow of blood to the heart and thus causes a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="10">When the blood clots dissolve, it can flow through the bloodstream and clog the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="11">Persons who already have a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another one.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ticagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca and marketed under the trade name of Briclique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots more improbable.</seg>
<seg id="13">The draft of NICE published today recommends a 12 month dose of 90mg Ticagrelor followed by 60mg with a twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">Professor Carole Longson, Director of the NICE Health Technology Centre, said: "despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disastrous consequences."</seg>
<seg id="15">The fear of a renewed heart attack can have considerable negative effects on the quality of life of a person.</seg>
<seg id="16">The experience shows that in combination with aspirin, Ticagrelor is effective in reducing other heart attacks and strokes in people who already had a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="17">With a preliminary recommendation from Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.</seg>

<seg id="1">Culture of Political Correctness makes electoral fraud flourishing in Muslim regions</seg>
<seg id="2">The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutsk Rahman was removed last year due to the release of a government report on corruption from office</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of Political Correctness has led to widespread ignoring of widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities as an annihilating governmental report today revealed.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sir Eric Pickles former cabinet member verbally attacks the police, election observers and town halls to refrain from ignoring electoral fraud on the basis of "intolerance regarding ethnicity and religion."</seg>
<seg id="5">The former minister of integration and communal government, who is now a politician king, said that intimidation from religious reasons would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off barrier tapes outside of voting cabins to protect intimidated voters.</seg>
<seg id="6">He recommends that voters should lead a card to prove their identity in elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">At present, a voter must only name his name and address.</seg>
<seg id="8">The report proposes to apply non-removable ink on a person's finger if they give up their vote to prevent someone selects twice.</seg>
<seg id="9">Whistleblowers should preserve more protection, says Sir Eric.</seg>
<seg id="10">It demands that the press should have more access to municipal documents and decisions made by unofficial committees or working groups.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "this is not only for election fraud but also to protect the municipal government from the wider corruption and financial fraud culture that is associated with it," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of Tower Hamlets election scandals in the east of London.</seg>
<seg id="13">Last year, a special court ruled that the acting mayor Lutsk was to be dismissed after a litany on corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Court found that Rahman would have perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community "in a cynical way" and that he silenced his critics with racissmus- and Islamophobia accusations.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "Rahman is said to have led" "" "his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">Up to 300 votes were either doubtful or the consequence of imitation in which one person chooses to be someone else.</seg>
<seg id="17">Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud in the whole country.</seg>
<seg id="18">He expressed in particular alarmingly to the fraudulent choice of letters - in which older members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to elect a candidate of their choice.</seg>
<seg id="19">Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean the electoral system, including guiding clues to prove the identity</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "in his report it says:" "" "evidence was placed that pressure was exerted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, to choose according to the will of elders, in particular communities with Pakistan or bangladin backgrounds." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "there were concerns that... State institutions have deliberately ignored such behaviour due to" politically correct "" "" oversensitivity concerning ethnicity and religion. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="22">Sir Eric advised 50 recommendations to clean the system, including the prohibition that political activists edit letters indiscriminately in order to stop "election harvesting."</seg>
<seg id="23">The report, considered by Theresa May, requires tougher registration checks to prevent the electoral directory being used for immigration and social security purposes.</seg>
<seg id="24">Consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID.</seg>
<seg id="25">Do not use removable ink on a person's finger as soon as she has left her voice to prevent someone selects twice.</seg>

<seg id="33">Intensification of the training to ensure that employees usually enforce that voters go alone in the electoral cab.</seg>
<seg id="34">Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "amazing" that after Tower Hamlets case there was no complaint.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "the Electoral Court has declared Lutsk Rahman and his deputy for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices unfit," "" "he said." ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Traveler Ian Wright abbot for a guide his tongue at the dirtiest places in Europe</seg>
<seg id="2">A British traveller undertook his immune system and throws a serious test by leaking some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The moderator and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk threw his train on a euro note, a railing at Piccadilly Circus, a flushing button on a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before the mating of each object he used an Luminometer to show himself and to us what he is going to get involved.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprising results to daylight.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought of rejecting the flushing button of a train toilet that has been used by thousands of others may be totally repellent, but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical specialists on the promotion of gut bacteria as well as about his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately nothing left what he licked out, more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright became known to test the resilience of his bowel by travelling through the world and eating unique and wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public railroads to train stations to rinsing buttons of toilets, the task definitely put its immune system under one sample</seg>
<seg id="11">In the film he told, "As a child, I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things into my mouth, earth, worms and sludge water."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he was definitely justified by his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His sample painting showed a luminance of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">In comparison to this, the Luminometer number of freshly washed hands is less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet he refused to refuse, after having had a luminance of more than 4000 units, while freshly washed hands were less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "in the film he says:" "" "this comes close to the worst thing I spoke in a toilet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more dirty than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will not lick here because it is disgusting here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D in order to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">Valios Senior Venice President for Snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "we really wanted to offer consumers something new.</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We conducted crazy brainstorming, ending that we said "Let's call Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked with the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who directed the movie, added: "let me say - I would have lost my respect for Ian, if he had tasted some of the things I had instructed him to lick, just like the disgusting Russian toilet that is shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to check them out and others where it was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "I'm glad that we recorded some of these dirty treats on film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by Valio from 2015 84 percent of all surveyed lactic acid bacteria associated with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58 percent said that they may at least occasionally use products containing lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="2">An asociale family left her social housing after a delogization with a loss of £50,000 because she had terrorized her neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="3">Tanya Skelby and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in Saltash, Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="4">Once they were forcibly removed from their property, the housing cooperative's employees found the property in an irreparable condition.</seg>
<seg id="5">The walls had clap holes, wooden planks were torn up, trash was scattered on the floor and graffiti was lubricated to the walls.</seg>
<seg id="6">The family was relocated and it is assumed that she is now living in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">Donna McEvoy, who works for the home administration of Cornwall Housing, said that she was afraid that the apartment was no longer repaired.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "she said," "" "It was a nightmare for the people here and I think that people don't have to live this way." ""</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider as this property is thought to be considered not as beautiful part of Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and its reputation is also notorious.</seg>
<seg id="11">The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment meanwhile and the police said that the terror that the family had inflicted on street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive crying, strikers and curses.</seg>
<seg id="12">Skelby, 47, whose name was on the lease, was given an arrangement for anti-social behaviour in June.</seg>
<seg id="13">In some rooms of the house, which may be torn down under certain circumstances, old rubbish was found</seg>
<seg id="14">In the estate where drugs were traded in the past, the wooden planks were torn up.</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbours said they had to fight them on the street and invoked the police on a regular basis.</seg>

<seg id="24">Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that the family had agreed to cooperate with local authorities.</seg>
<seg id="25">The family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="26">On the overgrown side of the church house garbage and old toys were dumped</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he added:" "" "it is a shame that the tenant agreed to accept any responsibility for their behavior and their family, as a delogization is always the last step considering the Cornwall housing." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case, because the behavior was extreme and their actions for their neighbours had to be terrible.</seg>
<seg id="29">I appreciate all the work that my team, the Devon and Cornwall police and members of the community who have courageously approached us and have given us the information.</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope this development will give comfort to some neighbours and the message conveys that anti-social behaviour will not be tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="31">Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20.</seg>
<seg id="32">A dirty mattress, which is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after deloving on the floor</seg>
<seg id="33">Workers of the property administration will now have to clean garbage cans that surround the house</seg>
<seg id="34">In 2014 the police conducted a raid in the house and found over 70g cannabis as well as balances, paraphernalia and cash in the amount of £1,700.</seg>
<seg id="35">Skelby received a fine after having found itself guilty of the possession of a drug of class B in commercial intent.</seg>

<seg id="37">After they were homeless, Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth.</seg>
<seg id="38">Many of the rooms of the house were graciously graded with graffiti.</seg>
<seg id="39">The police says they will delegate tenants who do not abide by the house rules</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals do not get anything from the summer campaign - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "in 2021, the Parliament elections will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays, the parliament's parliament decided already at the beginning of the year." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">For more stupid than so far it is not: summer holidays, heat and land elections - this bites.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals, who are to be persuaded by the elective fighters, are on vacation.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most of the vacationers who are in the countryside, on the island of Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not natives, so must not choose the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are practical problems: during the holidays, helpers, posters hang up, inflate balloons, distribute flyers and cast votes in the end, only teh up with difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until the 4th of September 2016, the election and last holiday day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to pass an election campaign just over the people.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, Leader of an SPD / CDU coalition, must be worried about his office.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in surveys.</seg>
<seg id="13">What is exciting is how strong newcomer AfD cuts and what remains at the end of coalition-proof.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years old and head of government since 2008, makes an almost inconspicuous election campaign, one sees from his big posters.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels across the country, distributes roses and chatting a little with the people, just as his legendary eloquent predecessor Harald Ringstorff had done.</seg>
<seg id="16">Otherwise, seafarers have got cold feet and chancellor Merkel blame for the blossoming of AfD.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "their refugee policy," "" "We create this" "", "hastened the rise of the right-wing populists, which will probably cost him the beautiful ministry." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU with its top candidate, the Minister of the Interior, Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is when you are at the right place at the wrong time.</seg>
<seg id="19">She has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to major explorations; the German Chancellor Angela Merkel is located in the north-east.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "there was probably the majority in other federal states," "" "said Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, recently in the NDR." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But it's a pity for anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once.</seg>
<seg id="23">Apart from that, the Nordost-CDU dispenses with the usual election campaigns on marketplaces and in front of shopping malls with umbrellas and balloons.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "that, according to Kokert, plays only a" "" "subordinate role" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="25">The Union has also noted that in the country you have to remove the base that it has to work very hard to find a wire to the people again.</seg>
<seg id="26">It is like the left, the SPD, the Greens: barely present in the expanse of the country.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "however, the Council of the CDU voter Kokert on his comrades is self-revealing:" "" "they have to go where it hurts, namely where people are: Dorffles, Golden weddings, every birthday party has to be used." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Because much is at stake, Sellering has now called his SPD a particularly committed campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In surveys complying with 22 per cent behind partner CDU (25) and just under AfD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">At the 2011 election, the SPD had still clearly gained 35.6 percent before the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">The Greens, the small party with seven percent in the polls, are likely to make the leap into the Parliament.</seg>

<seg id="2">There is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is rehabilitated.</seg>
<seg id="3">For those responsible for the construction work that begin at 5.30am and end only around 8pm, there is everywhere praise.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "they did everything rather crisp," "" "says Elvira Tetzlaff from the jet fuel station." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a SuperTeam.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is no delay.</seg>
<seg id="7">At the beginning of the week, the construction site could be relocated to the south at the beginning of the week, until the end of October everything should be ready.</seg>
<seg id="8">The opposite will also be praised for those responsible for construction work, for example when it comes to setting up residence permits.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site on Monday moved south and also the barrier of the asphalt road in Ofterdingen has been lifted and the connection to Rottenburg continues, the traffic situation within the town is relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now proceed on both sides by Ofterdingen from the B 27.</seg>
<seg id="11">The pass traffic through the place seems to go back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"there were some considerable discomforts," says the deputy chief manager Florian King responsible for the maintenance-related management of the rehabilitation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The residents of Bachlinstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise, because many routes were looking for and more familiar with their Navi than the signs.</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to the fact that some trucks spread in residential areas.</seg>
<seg id="15">As the speed limiters were not complied with, the community stepped up the boat from Mössingen.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "there were considerable riots," "" "says King, who made himself aware of the situation." ""</seg>

<seg id="19">Since the construction site has moved on, it has become calmer.</seg>
<seg id="20">For the business people at the B 27 it is only a little consolation that the road again is open for customers from Rottenburg.</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">However, the fact that the B 27 redevelopment has led to sales collapses allows everyone to look through.</seg>
<seg id="23">However some more and some are less affected.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "those who have less to do with the" "" "end customer" "" "are therefore produced for other companies, for whom the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences." ""</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "even at the car dealership Maier Thomas Sulz speaks of a" "" "maximum slight drop" "", "but also admits that" "" "the running documents are missing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The most powerful are the local streets along the road.</seg>
<seg id="27">J. Albert Göhner, proprietor of the Steakhouse, formerly Crown, finds clear words.</seg>
<seg id="28">This is existential threatening.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "not only him, but all the restaurants" "" "hit hard" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">Customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "we need to be happy about every euro turnover." ""</seg>

<seg id="33">"" "street renovation has thrown back its operation" "" "by two years." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">He had to release half of his staff.</seg>
<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed, politics would have reacted differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, government president Jörg Schmidt on a request by Göhner said if there could be a financial compensation, the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation on the B 27. now they must also bear the disadvantages arising from the rehabilitation.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows of other rural districts, where something more generous has been handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">With all complaints, Göhner is certain that his restaurant will continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="39">After all, the family business has been settled here since 1715, and refers to the long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">He can understand that other regular guests now look less frequently because of the complicated routes of traffic.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you cannot get there, it is also beautiful elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="42">He has no doubt that his family clientele came back to the end of the rehabilitation work.</seg>
<seg id="43">Despite the crises with BSE and avian flu, Göhner considers the effects of the B 27 construction on his clients for the biggest crisis that his restaurant has experienced in its long-standing history.</seg>
<seg id="44">Construction work for six months, this is already brutal.</seg>

<seg id="15">"" "" "" "the call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security authorities is not surprising as well." ""</seg>

<seg id="17">"" "" "" "these will be difficult points for the SPD," "" "admits the CDU man." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">He still considers this to be reasonable and does not demand anything that has no chances in the coalition partner anyway.</seg>
<seg id="19">De Maizière also presents a few new ideas.</seg>
<seg id="20">Some of them have it in themselves: he plans rapid procedures for deportations and more opportunities for detecting people from deportation.</seg>
<seg id="21">Refugees who are targeted to the country should check their smartphone in advance and disclose social media accounts for a security check.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the case of bulations for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to make some even worse - such as those who commit crimes or consciously throw away their papers in order to disguise their identity.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some of them are politically and judiciary.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some of them are still unwiped and leave questions unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="25">And at some points - in the unequal treatment of patients for example - the question arises: what does this actually have to do with security and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">Yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the subjects of refugees and terror.</seg>
<seg id="27">But it cannot be questioned that the residents of Ansbach and Wuerzburg were refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">In addition, in view of the high number of refugees, many people were worried about security.</seg>
<seg id="29">And things that people profoundly dealt with could not be excluded even in election times.</seg>
<seg id="30">The inner security is simply shifted into the focus.</seg>
<seg id="31">First the attacks in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.</seg>
<seg id="32">Then the attacks in Wuerzburg and Ansbach.</seg>
<seg id="33">The uncertainty is great.</seg>
<seg id="34">And yes, there are electoral campaigns.</seg>

<seg id="37">Only a gargantly dispute about the equipment of the Federal Police, then a security policy collection of some Unions interior ministers, in which the department chiefs also demand a Burmka prohibition and a reversal of dual citizenship.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination Boards: who actually buys vinyl records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men middle aged love boards.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you rush to the comment section, under the pseudonym of not Allegema's middle-aged middle-aged middle-age with rough insults, this statement derives from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the much-discussed re-creation of vinyl records is not attributable to a boom in millennials who want to welcome the news of physical objects, but to be traced back to Midlife nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a record are all foresight according to the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely group of buyers.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a horde by hobbyists - it has an emotional impact: older record buyers tend to keep their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog were a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soho, a modest grey suit and smoked wildly before I stand, keep my hands and tell something absurd as: "so, let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even though the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings where independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic plate specialty shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to switch off the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to assess their age and mood by observing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, from Sister Ray (number of data: two young women, three middle-aged men) into Reckless Records (number of data: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably around the 20), is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "I guess already," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3.000 or 4,000 slabs.</seg>
<seg id="17">These vinyl records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by email, I didn't follow him home), the walls of his living room suffer.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records he couldn't afford when they appeared and bought items he sold when he was young and broke.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "many things I buy are from the late 60's, early '70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I thought was too young to buy them," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who buy records are rather introverted and like to spend time alone, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink too much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works with Sister Ray, also believes that many clients, whom he meets, apply to YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">He has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media team, people who have heard about the comeback and are forced to buy their old records again.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the conversations I have conducted, people usually have to get rid of their collection in the same way around the year 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their records again, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom to revivals of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the supposed emotional significance of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It only takes a few seconds to realize that record stores offer a calming community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ, some of the older customers contacted the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar gramophone envelopes, objects that evoke blissful youth memories.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of consolation," "" "says WEZ." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">This is the case with me as a collector and I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like her social workers!" "" "an employee flees from a record pile." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey conducted by the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month have not yet listened.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% have a record player that they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record have no record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report I would probably look very concerned as I smoked by a pile of Bossa nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (number of data: three middle-aged men) has noticed a "trophies aspect" of the revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"" "" "" "someone just came here recently and said:" "" "I don't own a record player, but I would like to buy a Radiohead record so I can put her into the shelf," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productive, less musical.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "we have people who say," "" "I don't have a record player." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older ones who only slowly enter.</seg>
<seg id="44">Mop, which has devoted almost a whole floor to the records, has a colourful audience when I go in.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenage boys and middle-aged girls.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the aforementioned shops - Wild Beasts newest synthesizer and sexier pop rather than experimental jazz made out of speakers - it is good to see such a diversity among customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks very lonely, but the mental trauma is hard to detect if you stand next to someone for 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around the store for a few minutes and considers the variety of plates available for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">She's doing a window-window rather than buying a big shopping.</seg>
<seg id="50">She doesn't deserve much, so collecting records isn't a real option, she says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way, but the beauty of records is... "it drives with a loving sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record enthusiasts: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I give the impression of muting the jeans pockets, I watch a group of young girls who group for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter are thinking about buying a crossover record player.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left is a staircase, a wall full of plates from Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">No one looks at them - maybe because they are purely decorative, some so far up that it is impossible to touch them.</seg>
<seg id="58">"" "it is pure" "" "panel art" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that each attraction for these items means more money for the industry and some customers might send to the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, is also the one that is most used for luxury objects such as records.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even though my research showed that the results of YouGov vote, they omit, at least in record shops in Soho, the large number of female collectors and record lover that exist in reality, record stores and online forums.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They don't spend their thursday tomorrow with a stroll through record stores on Berwick Street and the sheets through plates, while avoiding the staring look of an uncanny, 30-year-old false Moderator hanging over the shoulders of bad middle-aged men.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais where thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">During a court hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 provisional deals in which persons within the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, sell hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The prefecture of Calais argued that these places were to be pulled down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which would hold a fire and sanitary risk.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups shared the Court that businesses and restaurants were important, as free meals offered by the state-supported union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also stated that the provisional shops and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who operate the 72 provisional deals, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were "absolutely comprehensible."</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "the judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than just people living in extremely precarious conditions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places threatened by the fall was the Jungle Book Kids' Café des Camp, which is charitable and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes, as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170,000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids "Café.</seg>

<seg id="13">The two help organizations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the Jungle Camp has increased to more than 9,000 people - the highest number even now - following a steep increase in newcomers during the summer.</seg>

<seg id="2">Germany's racers have to adjust to the next generation of speed razors: in different federal states, among others in Hesse and Brandenburg, new flash devices are tested, which should be particularly effective.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Futuristic Enforcement Trailers from Vitronic from Wiesbaden can be used, for example, at accident places where it would be too dangerous for mobile measurement by the police.</seg>
<seg id="4">For example, on motorway construction sites or to rehabilitating bridges with temporary speed polishing, there is often no necessary infrastructure to provide a stationary blaker to ensure compliance with speed limit.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, a permanently mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Enforcement Trailer is self-sufficient: with uninterrupted measuring operation, its battery lasts five days, the case data is transmitted encrypted over a modem.</seg>
<seg id="7">Laser measurement technology enables all vehicles to be recorded at the same time across multiple tracks.</seg>
<seg id="8">Variable speed limiters as well as access prohibitions at time, lanes and vehicle class can also be monitored.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to the manufacturer, the trailer can be moved by car with trailer hitch in the state-of-the-art state.</seg>
<seg id="10">In order that it is not simply stowed, it is lowered in the measuring mode, so that the wheels in the armoured and by the way cast iron outer shell disappear.</seg>
<seg id="11">In addition, a built-in alarm system should protect the glitter from vandalism.</seg>
<seg id="12">Since 2015, the trailer has been tested according to Vitronic information in different federal states and is now also used.</seg>

<seg id="2">Britain's impressive performance at 7-day rugby came in the final on Thursday night to an abrupt halt in the last hurdle in the form of Fijis, when they were hit in the Deodoro Stadium in Rio with a result of 43-7.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji provided a master class in the handling, side-steppe, back-back, line course and raw power to win gold - its first Olympic medalist of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was won by the not too bad winning price of the silver medal - Great Britain's fourth this day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day, could fall back to them in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But regardless of this, Fiji would have defeated a 15-man-team in this form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a consolation for GB - but it probably won't - that at least a Briton tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck: Fijis head coach Ben Ryan, former head of England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago they lost each game at the Adelaide Sevens in Ryan.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they only lost one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This folder will hurt, but progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji began wonderful and left the attacks of GBs for fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for Captain Tom Mitchell and Co. as if you were running in driving buses. the World Series winners went 5-0 to the top when Osea Kolinisau froze in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With only four minutes of playing, Jerry Tuwa added another attack from the right-hand corner which he turned around.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A hampant Tackle from Mitchell halted the mountain of man Leone Nakarawa to achieve a third goal, but it only stopped Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute contest jasa Veremalua in the right corner a touch down and there stood 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new one since the re-whistle and there was still more than one minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou presided by further weak Tacklings of the UK team and rushed up to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The transformation brought a 29-0 to the break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It's like Fiji was born to play the 7, while GB has still been taught.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB maintained fundamental changes in half-time and closed the fijian gap... for four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua Tuisova went through a brilliant intermediate play of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game had long been in favor of the South Sea consuls, whose fans cheered flags and danced on the tribune.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliam put the icing on the cake with another try in the last seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The whistle sounded, the Fijis embraced and GB kicked in the grass.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier on that day Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi-finals with 20-5 and Great Britain pushed South Africa in a scarce semi-finalist match of the race - Great Britain's transformation of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the Boks to the front in the first half, but Dan Norton broke through the line with an impressive footwork and scored a gate among the posts in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late tackling by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside team, guaranteed winning - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="2">There will be no more emotinous gold than in these games and that wants to be called.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first stroke to the last, 220 hard pieve that enter history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even though there were only those who sat at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the Trainers Robin Williams, was present when they rowed to the second Olympiagold in the second without tax woman, the first women in the history of British sports who set such a benchmark.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their dominance was absolutely, after all, their 39.6 unbeaten work, which is also unprecedented.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant athlets gliding over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the style of the triumphal geese.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in rowing there is a battalion of willing helpers who make the difference and it was no more instrumental than the coach who did not know if he would survive this day at all than he was diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said he was risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer that is able to operate and that's what they did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you don't do that, it will spread everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty terrible situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a bit the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio thanked that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of season, which kept the interruption to a minimum, if that was the right term at all in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to get better soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was hospitalized and ran around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rowing is already a challenge, but that makes it even bigger.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the immediacy of victory, her first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nerve wrecking morning doing something more than usual, trying to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "panning who served as captain in the Royal Artillery Regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan said" "" "I was an emotional wreck this week. that's a bit extreme, but it means so much." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">It only repeats how much that means, how much I and Helen and also Robin worked.</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin we would be nobody, so a massive thank you to him. he's the best trainer in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I couldn't have wished for a better person for training or a better trainer.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning did not lose any race in the last five years.</seg>

<seg id="8">Rupert Geller, who has been a member of the association for 31 years, stands behind all this for 28 years as Managing Director.</seg>
<seg id="9">He was now retired at the age of 65.</seg>
<seg id="10">The drinking water purpose association of the Veitenstein Group, based in Kottendorf, municipality of Breitbrunn, annually transports approximately 150000 cubic meters of water and supplies 32 villages and hamlets with about 5500 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="11">Member municipalities are the congregations of Kirchenstein, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the town of Baunach.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are water supply contracts for other cities and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">The current chairman, Breitbrunner mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), reminded that Rupert Geller was appointed a waterman in 1985 and was appointed managing director of the Zweckverband in 1988.</seg>

<seg id="16">There has been no standstill and new additions have always been added, because water is the most important food and drinking water is the most important food.</seg>
<seg id="17">In her laudation she praised Göllers loyal, reliable and correct service over 31 years.</seg>

<seg id="1">Steel - Lichtblick for the German steel industry</seg>
<seg id="2">The crisis-torn and energy-intensive German steel industry remains unaffected by additional costs in millions.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens dedicated to the industry from green electricity subsidies are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">It remains in the release from the Renewable Energy Conversion to the existing plants for so-called own electricity production in the German steel industry, said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ, Friday edition).</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "I am really happy that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years of tough negotiations." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The European Commission therefore initially planned to ask the steel producers to use the gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the German industry association, the steel industry threatened an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year.</seg>
<seg id="8">Gabriel said the WAZ, there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.</seg>
<seg id="9">Only when the generators in the steel mills are replaced are an EEG levy of 20 percent.</seg>
<seg id="10">But even these are not raised in the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">The IG Metall welcomed Germany's agreement with the European Commission on its own electricity production.</seg>
<seg id="12">Thus the status quo of the current regulation is largely determined.</seg>
<seg id="13">Gabriel's successful effort for the steel industry is of particular importance.</seg>

<seg id="17">The steel industry in Europe has been suffering from overcapacity and considerable price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="18">Last year the situation was aggravated further, when the world's largest producer country China threw massive steel on the world market due to the weakening domestic demand.</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers accuse Chinese steel companies price dumping.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the course of this spring, the situation has somewhat relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the one hand, import duties imposed on import steel show effect, on the other hand the economic outlook has brightened up in China.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is unclear how sustainably the price-up is.</seg>
<seg id="23">The German industry leader Thyssenkrupp stays cautiously on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">Last but not least, the prices would have stagnated again.</seg>
<seg id="25">The sector responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">Last but not least ThyssenKrupp did not want to exclude closure of individual works.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the end of 2015, some 86,000 people were employed in the German steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="28">In July the German steel producers are cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders.</seg>
<seg id="29">At 3.4 million tonnes, they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year's month, as the Steel Federation hastened on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="30">After a short increase in May, the quantity produced went back the second month in a row.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since the beginning of the year, production is two percent lower than the previous year's figure.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the coming months, the association expects an improved order situation with a rising output.</seg>

<seg id="1">Community, spirit, health: singing does the seniors well</seg>
<seg id="2">The singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp her whole life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, she occupied the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "" "" "singing moves me - emotionally and physically," "" "she describes." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and overall more alive, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">By the way, she does something good for her health and her mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">Because singing is a great hobby for seniors right from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler from the German senior league.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most seniors sing in the choir and share with like-minded people the joy of music, describes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through regular interaction, seniors can socialize and maintain social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Social and family structures often dissolve in old age, a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "this experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir:" "" "to speak and organize, to be able to rely on the others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be exhausting in a positive sense, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">For doing so, seniors train a deep and controlled respiration.</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who regularly demand their lungs get out of the puff even in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even if it is about getting the sound of the voice in old age, singing is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">In older people, singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Labour Association of Senior Citizens.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations, joint singing had a much higher priority, it was part of everyday life, both at school and in leisure, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observes that singing or hearing of songs in older people wakes many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.</seg>
<seg id="18">Lyrics and special melodies are self-restrained by dementia sufferers of long-coming events.</seg>
<seg id="19">In singing, the head also demands a special performance, Lenz declared.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time focusing on one's own voice and a given rhythm and adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Especially older people who live alone practice not only to focus on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition seen by singing in the chorus, Hackler says.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">Also the self-esteem grows through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show oneself: if I practise for a long time, I become better and alert beyond me - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to start singing there is enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Who wants to try out a new hobby, should not hesitate - even if he means to have little talent, Lenz advises.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who does hear when a sound goes beside it?</seg>
<seg id="29">In search of the right offer, seniors have different options, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone sings from the circle of acquaintances in a senior's choir, one can simply join.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many towns also offer overviews of the choirs in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can contact the church or the church leader.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many people's choirs can also be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">Those who do not have access to the Internet can ask the family, friends or neighbors for help with the internet research.</seg>
<seg id="35">Those who want to sing, should necessarily join a choir, tells Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does the soul well and has something liberating - that is true for all ages.</seg>

<seg id="19">Thai media also wanted to recognise a pattern typical of the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks were not related to the Islamist revolt movement or international terrorism.</seg>

<seg id="26">In Thailand, there are still smaller bombings, but most of the time they are not directed towards tourists.</seg>

<seg id="8">But it was rather his not just sporting figure, which attracted the attention of the international media.</seg>
<seg id="9">Why does the 24-year-old take part in the Olympic Games?</seg>
<seg id="10">The Ethiopian received a special startingright from the International Swimming Federation.</seg>

<seg id="5">Due to legal basis, the barendorf market is obliged to operate the facilities in a cost-effective manner.</seg>
<seg id="6">As of 1 October 2016, citizens as well as the commercial and industrial companies from Welshahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to dig deeper into the wallets.</seg>
<seg id="7">The revenue increases are between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">As head of the board of directors Herbert Schmidt displayed the body, a new calculation of the fees for the wastewater facilities of the market community was necessary.</seg>
<seg id="9">Over the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over and over-covers from the preceding calculation period can also be equated.</seg>
<seg id="10">Schmidt founded the gravid increase in revenue by producing relatively small facilities with a very low waste water intake, between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year.</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, due to the low distribution basis, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly decreasing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Last but not least, due to their age of refurbishment and repair, all three plants have a considerable extent on all three plants.</seg>
<seg id="14">The facility in Azendorf was nearly 30 years old, the facilities for Welshahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp nearly 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt proved that the mechanical ventilation system in the Azendorf sewage plant had to be replaced because of harm.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the Pumpwerk Welshahl, the nearly 20 year old conveyor systems had to be overhauled and the first sewage sludge had to be extended after nearly 20 years of operation, the sewage sludge was disposed of and an additional ventilation capability had to be installed in order to be able to comply with the legal requirements in the future.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "Schmidt:" "" "for these extraordinary expenses, the continued care and maintenance costs that have to be taken into account in the new calculation period have come into consideration." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The same applies to electricity costs, which in the previous years of 2011 / 2012 were significantly below the current level.</seg>

<seg id="1">Snapchat "Anime" effect as Asian caricature criticises</seg>
<seg id="2">Snapchat states that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to races.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its filesystem, Snapchat allows around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that borders the absurdity.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are inundable, property-based tools that produce more than 30 million improved selfies per day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All missteps are made public.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapchat filters have drawn criticism in the past in which they were accused of the fact that the app would promote blackface or white skin as a beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">When this week some users suggested a filter that gave them slotted eyes, false teeth and bloated cheeks, some critics called a racist caricature of Asians - "yellow face."</seg>
<seg id="9">They wondered if these repeated controversy surrendered to a larger problem that the company has diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and outrage were widespread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat announced that it would have deactivated the feature.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company provided an apology: the filter was intended as an homage to anime characters and not as a caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders, who have experienced racism, reminded the filter of hurtful clichés.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others rejected the anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "in an e-mail, Grace Sparapani wrote a Korean-American art student whose tweet about the photos became widespread that the filter was" "" "vulnerable" "" "and the least unpleasant." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it is difficult to argue with the contrast between a very contradictory Asian caricature and the filter effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not yellow-faced, but that the yellow face was pulled into the degrading extreme.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural stumbling block.</seg>
<seg id="18">American culture seems to be entangled in an endless diversity and integration struggle, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchat's big audience of young people - who are more diverse than their older counterparts - could be more likely to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">When one of Snapchats filters a picture that is insulting for a user, "it is much more difficult that such things remain unnoticed than it was before," said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday Zhu, who worked as a product manager and engineer for medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and asked others to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In an essay for medium and in a telephone interview, she said that she believes racial-related controversies reflect a lack of diversity among the recruitment practices of Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu criticized the large part white, only male leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.</seg>
<seg id="24">"either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce so that they can make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colours that work there, but not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say about it."</seg>
<seg id="25">Others share their opinion, a complaint that Snapchat largely left unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="26">The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural background of his employees, but according to a spokesman, the company recently recruited a personnel responsible focusing on subrepresented population groups and on internal integration efforts.</seg>
<seg id="28">Zhu also said that she will leave her Snapchat account and added, "I wonder if they need more users like us to say that they are not O.K.."</seg>

<seg id="5">"intelligence gathering, typically outsourced by high-level CentCom commanders, periodically recorded a positive picture of US efforts against terrorism, as the actual conditions on site were allowed and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence agencies," cited a newspaper article.</seg>
<seg id="6">"what happened at CentCom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," Ken Calvert, republican member of the House of Representatives, stated.</seg>
<seg id="7">The management mistakes in the CentCom range up to the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report presents detailed detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there is no direct evidence suggesting that government leaders under Obama have given directions to change reports, it shows how analysts are exposed to pressure from their superiors to draw an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.</seg>
<seg id="10">"during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements before the Congress were clearly more positive than the facts" stated the report.</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, a CentCom member publicly announced that a military reconquest would begin in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "after months of investigation, so much is clear." "" "said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in a statement." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">From the middle of the year 2014 to the middle of 2015, the leaders of the Central Command changed intelligence reports to play down the danger of ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called on the Task Force after they were admitted that analysts were worried about manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings while the investigation continues.</seg>
<seg id="17">Additionally, further investigations of CentCom are underway by the Secretary General's General Inspector.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the intelligence service committee published their own findings on Thursday that coincided with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in 2014 and 2015 CentCom created an overly limited process for creating intelligence assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services," announced the highest-level democrat in the steering committee, a member of the House of Representatives, Adam B. Schiff, in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "this process," "" "Mr. Schiff," "" "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," "" "harmed morals among analysts and" "" "gave very little room for dissenting views." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Schiff and the democrats stated that there was no evidence of intervening in the White House at Centcom Analysts concerning a "certain political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "the preliminary results of the proceedings of the Congress were published on Tuesday by" "" "The Daily Beast" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon's General Inspector who was included following complaints by CentCom.</seg>
<seg id="24">Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the reports of the Congress, while the investigators of the General Inspector were still under way.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "but he also stated that" "" "experts sometimes have divergent views on the interpretation of complex data and that intelligence agencies and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have repercussions on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence).</seg>
<seg id="27">The allegations of last year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest estimates of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of divisions more than ten years ago, when a Centcom Analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a document about how the then government under George W. Bush only foresaw a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the revolt against the current reporting of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, the team headed by Mr. Hooker states that, contrary to the statements by the government, airstrikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State would have no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these temporary refineries took into operation in order to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">However, this recognition has not been published, the Times reported in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">CentCom's then ordered Commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by members of the legislature for his overly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin was retired in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel at the Central Command.</seg>

<seg id="3">Five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable achievement, but Bam (27) said she could not remember that ever done.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "I have no idea." "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">I don't belong to the people who keep their goals in mind.</seg>

<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.</seg>

<seg id="9">The first placed will make the strong Dutch get a bit longer out of the way that the other group will lead.</seg>
<seg id="10">As always the game may go out on Saturday, the Americans have triggered a surprising vortex by their success story, four years after they landed at the last London games on the last of 12 places.</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had a hockey stick in her hands for the first time at three years (her two older sisters played sports at Drexel University), with 16 years she became the national player of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team.</seg>

<seg id="19">On Thursday evening Bam opened the door-row in the first half of the game with a back-stop from the suture area.</seg>
<seg id="20">India had gone into play without victory in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the score from 1-0 up to the third quarter until Bam took the game into her hands.</seg>
<seg id="21">She performed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then pulled into the middle and pulled the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2-0 lead.</seg>

<seg id="1">Amid the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, how late it is, it's the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and unavoidable, a fast relay between competition and aspiration.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is like the Olympic torch itself is a burning staff handed down from the wristwatch to a swimmer to the triathlete.</seg>
<seg id="5">You cannot turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to the conversation of your neighbour in the waiting queue in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Leaks or the quarrel between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there are Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who was there for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women's black with dimples, could well be among those known names sent to Prime Time through sponsors and well-being TV advertising, if he were a swimmer, gymnast or even fencer.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the Olympic trampolines.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event identically.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the centre, partly in the shade are the sports that are not generally accepted: gun shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breast-swimming and may it rule it for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I like to make arguments for my particular favourite, then let me draw attention to the discrete charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, it was so sparsely perceived in the last 16 years that many of the ones I had asked, did not know that it is an olympic port at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA sent athletes to the competition, there has never been a medal in jumping on the trampoline and has had an athlete until 2012, who has made it to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to divide the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend this year's Gold Medal from London.</seg>
<seg id="18">Jumping on the trampoline has a certain outsider charm, partly because it sounds suitable for the unenlightened ear for a clownsschool than the one for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I'm not an expert, but only an experienced enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humoristic potential - the cartoonable trembling of his never-ending upsurge - but also the Grazie of gymnastics and diving, the two sports which essentially unite.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "the word" "" "trampolines" "" "comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means" "" "springboard" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Aspiring conquerors jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements (turning, pike and saltos) before they land on their feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "they are rated according to official Olympiaprogram of performance, difficulty and" "" "flight time" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The common olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists have to go farther, faster, up and over in their quest for gold, sometimes up to the finish, sometimes back and forth, up and down on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They not only hunt the finish line or the output wall, but also in the televised broadcasting a more ridiculous aim: the world or the olympic record.</seg>
<seg id="28">The goal-oriented aspiration is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to even touch a spectator with tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it's also what I feel fatigued when watching these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a respite.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is also a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can be.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualification and final rounds of the women will be held on Friday afternoon, at 13.00 Eastern Time streaming; the men on Saturday also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the final rounds as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of the Olympic-Mania, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in the general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the Angus and the objective of male athlete - as the Male US Turner suggested recently - Mr Dooley awaits its air rinding, new fan base.</seg>

<seg id="1">"a generation protested" in Ethiopia, Long is an ally of the United States</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators calling for political changes in Ethiopia met with a violent resistance of the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that dozens of protesters were killed during clashes with the police.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just breaking together?</seg>
<seg id="6">In the last ten years, it was one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in recent months protests against the government troubled the country and spread more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people rushed into the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to human rights organisations, the response of the government was ruthless.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses stated that policemen shot and killed dozens of unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">Videos about the protests, probably from the last or the beginning of this year, show how security professionals hit young people with sticks while they were forced to make a stand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "" "" "the head of the UN Human Rights Council is now asking for an in-depth investigation." ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa at the International Crisis Group, a research group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence agencies work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terrorist hazards beyond the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if at all, get so much Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at considerable speed.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">The roads are usually quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Although Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have consistently led the government's oppression - the opposition in the country was restricted, although dissidents were effectively silenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or in prison, killed or driven into the vast expanses of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"when you suppress people and have no other options other than to protest, it breaks off," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stranglehold in terms of power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">Following a widely criticised election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, tensions continue along the border to Eritrea; a struggle for this jagged, controversial line called hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, which have been forced more or less in recent years, could exploit the turbulence and re-arm themselves.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness after years of wardness explode under the surface now.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years many Ethiopians have been able to communicate with the social media, since cheaper smartphones have become more and more frequent and improved internet services.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government blocks the access to Facebook and Twitter what it does at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via internet proxies that hide where they stay.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians admitted that they were gathered to protests like this.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">For eons the Amharas prospering, who come from Ethiopia's predominantly Christian Highlands, in politics and economy as they exploited the Oromos, of which many Muslims are and live in lowland areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But that is exactly what changes.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "we are there to coordinate below a screen," "" "said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests took place in the areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is unfairally dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray, which accounts for about 6 percent of the population and which are dominant in the military, intelligence services, commerce and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr Meles, a former rebel leader, was until his death on an unpublicized illness in 2012 for 17 years of Ethiopian Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was regarded as a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly well versed in perceiving early signs of discontent and using special officers to process opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the current regime lacks this basic skill," "" "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively obscure reasons to take the position of Mr Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time that Ethiopia had witnessed such a upheaval in 2005, after thousands were protesting against elections which, according to the information given by analysts, were apparently fucked by the government and subsequently stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the ensuing raids many protesters were killed, even if there were less than in the last months and this time of unrest passed relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as their measurable progress in poverty alleviation.</seg>
<seg id="53">But apparently this did not prevent the intensification of the internal depletion of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it assumes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Protesters in Gondar, an amharan city, attacked by Tigray attacked shops and hate against the Tigray become more and more common in social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests brought the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as a stronghold for neighboring Somalia, although it recently announced that it closed this basis.</seg>
<seg id="58">While Westerners clearly want to support democracy, he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile region.</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his claim Obama was founded ISIS was "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried to dispel the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking that his repeated assertion, President Obama and Hillary Clinton would have been the "Founder" of the terrorist group Islamic State, not serious.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification raised new questions about the communication skills of the Republican Republican candidate, whether he was able to communicate clearly and understandable to the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also entails his comrades who endeavour to take care of him during an eventful phase, in the peculiar position of declaring statements that he could not have said at all.</seg>
<seg id="5">After he had made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump declined in relation to the allegation on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to interpret, the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning Tweet on Friday Mr. Trump said he was just sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Tweet was contrary to the previous day when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he meant the accusation completely seriously.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative Radiomorator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump to weaken the statement that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate didn't want to know about it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism kicks down on Mr. Trump while trying to focus his campaign on the economic situation due to falling demand figures.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton talked about the business situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject again.</seg>
<seg id="12">Commenting on Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump already brought sarcasm back to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he drew strong criticism when he said that the Russians were to chop Ms Clinton's emails, but later he explained, "Of course, I meant the sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic boundaries of politics and then rowing back as needed.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans as they arrive, and then" clarify "depending on how the reaction fails." said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who monitors the language of both candidates.</seg>
<seg id="17">But I think he's clever enough to keep his statements vaguely enough so that they can be interpreted in various ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of defying the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump adopted an even stronger tone since his survey values have gone further.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist published on Friday showed a major lead in North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump is generally trying to apologise for his provocative statements, he often accuses his critics to distort his statements or misunderstand his humor.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while strengthening the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps jokes have brought his loyal co-workers into the uncomfortable situation to stand at him regardless of how provocative his statements may be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trumps most prominent advocates, took great effort to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview of Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"I believe what he says is legitimate, political commentaries" said Mr Giuliani about the correctness of Mr. Trump's statements about whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true in this sense that before Obama IS IS an almost unknown, small organization, he called them back bendles, completely wrong, and therefore it happened because he withdrew troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most mainstream republicans are attempting to argue that the Obama administration, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to spread by taking control of the situation in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="26">Before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of lying on each of his words and being prejudiced against him.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he defied the" "" "poor, junuchs" "" "television experts who try to understand him and said," "" "You can't!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the Democrats mocked Mr. Trumps's apology as just another proof that he was unsuitable for president's office.</seg>

<seg id="2">Verb Cafe was a nice café in Williamsburg, in which one could pay only cash, which had no Wi-Fi, but served fine coffee for 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="3">Of course, the prices came out of Bedford Avenue store front.</seg>
<seg id="4">The store Soap Cherie, who replaced the verb in summer 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Native people smoked it as the last loss in a gentrifying city.</seg>
<seg id="6">The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is change, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel is apart and Verb is now a soap business."</seg>
<seg id="7">But if New York is changing, it is also new finding.</seg>
<seg id="8">A revitalised club opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.</seg>
<seg id="9">The new club has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same employees and a similarly simple atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="10">The coffee is still good.</seg>
<seg id="11">The new owner of the club is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-standing employee of the old café, the owner and managing director of the new coffee shop.</seg>
<seg id="12">He started working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.</seg>
<seg id="13">When a customer offered to provide money for a new foreign office, he was excited to do it, he said.</seg>

<seg id="16">It even uses the same lights from the old club.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment.</seg>
<seg id="18">He introduced new ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the menu there are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and garnishes such as capers and sour onions.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are natural rice dishes.</seg>
<seg id="21">The café serves no beer, but there are fresh juices.</seg>
<seg id="22">After nine months Rodriguez said that he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "many old customers were also displaced by prices from Williamsburg," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oliveira was such a client.</seg>
<seg id="25">Oliveira, 34, lived in Williamsburg earlier and visited the club on a regular basis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even after being moved to Greenpoint, she would take the way.</seg>

<seg id="30">Since the beginning of the club, Tom Rosenthal is a loyal customer since the beginning of the club in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="31">He went there before the work and inevitably ordered the same.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "" "" "I came fourth after seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Everything bagel with butter," "" "he said." ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland: the oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland-sharks frequently come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an inquiry on board the ship ship Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and floats with good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland-sharks get offspring only with 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">Leisurely, the Greenland-shark swims along the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it reaches an average of just 1,220 metres wide.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it arrives, the five-metre-long animal accelerates at full 2.6 km / h - and with this top speed is half as fast as a seal.</seg>
<seg id="9">This lifestyle characterized by slowness seems to be a panacea for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reported in the journal "Science" in any case by a Grönland-shark, who could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock discusses this life span, which represents a world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="12">Admittedly, the evolutionist has long assumed that Greenland will become stone-old.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was missing.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland-sharks are hard to observe, after all, they live mainly in the ice-sea in front of the sparsely populated coast of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually only occur in winter on the surface.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland-sharks.</seg>
<seg id="17">Her slow-motion-tempo measured her, when she equipped six animals with a transmitter in front of Spitsbergen.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, researchers found the remains of a seal in the stomach of an animal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">They might chase sleeping animals or patrols at the bottom of the ice cream and look for cadaver who torches from higher water-layers downwards.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues investigated 28 Greenland-sharks, which fishermen caught between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch from the depth of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 cm long, while the largest 502 centimetre was measured.</seg>
<seg id="22">In order to determine the age of the animals, they analysed the lens nucleus of the sharks with the carbon-14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens is already born before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained therein are no longer renewed.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had notably much carbon-14 in the lens nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="25">Its birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s, when nuclear disarmament attempts to bring greater amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">On the other hand, with 220 centimeters of length, the lenticular nucleus contained a low surplus of carbon-14 from nuclear weapons testing, so it should have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the other hand, all larger Grönlandharks had normal carbon-14 amounts in their lenticular nucleus, which result from cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14 clock for a 493-centimeter long Greenland hallow showed an age of 335 years, while the record shark with 502 centimeters might even be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland-shark females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to classify the length of an old age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably stood at the threshold of the sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years, Greenland-sharks with the multiplication obviously leave at least one and a half centuries time.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also likely to be world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methane emblems live mainly in icy waters is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">The previous record holder, a 211-year old Grönlandwal, whose speck stuck to the neck a 120-year-old harpoon point, was caught in front of Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the living animals often runs on asparagus flame.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and age slowly.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are also often very big.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal loses heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram mouse therefore is much larger than with one gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants as possible as early as possible," explains the evolution biologist Scheuerlein.</seg>
<seg id="42">A very large animal, on the other hand, should invest its resources more in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="7">In a blatant contrast, Donald Trump is hiding behind false pretenders and retracts regarding his promises to date.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax statements, although they are not obliged by law because of this.</seg>

<seg id="12">Trump critics, among other things, the Republican presidential candidate of 2012 Mitt Romney, have already announced that his refusal to raise questions regarding assets, his donations for charitable organisations, his businessmen and various other connections, especially with Russia.</seg>
<seg id="13">Clinton has already toppled on the subject and released a video on the Internet on Friday in which high-ranking Republican Trump calls to publish his tax return.</seg>

<seg id="16">Politico has reported that during the 1990s, Trump paid no taxes or only very little taxes, and a business journalist of the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax consultants on Friday, stating that this could still be the case.</seg>
<seg id="17">Federal taxes have become an issue in the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="18">Clinton supports a regulation named after billionaire and investor Warren Buffett, which would make sure that people who earn more than USD 1 million will pay a tax rate of at least 30%.</seg>
<seg id="19">President Obama also supports the proposal.</seg>

<seg id="4">During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the country's list of countries.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, the country was not listed among the countries that could be invoked directly from the hotel room.</seg>

<seg id="7">Wrote Lanzmann.</seg>
<seg id="8">Instead, the Kempinksi Bristol offers an opportunity to choose Israel from its own call center.</seg>

<seg id="10">The answer he received there "shocked him," as Lanzmann wrote.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "the hotel staff said that the measure was a" "" "deliberate decision by management of the Kempinski hotels." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="16">This is really very shameful.</seg>
<seg id="17">The fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even greater disgrace.</seg>
<seg id="18">This does not need any explanation.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "we expect the hotel to" "" "draw the right conclusions," "" "said the minister." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">The incident triggered a fairly large resonance in the internet, where people called it a scandal.</seg>

<seg id="2">The ministers from the soul care unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on the way during a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">Together, four stages were completed.</seg>
<seg id="4">In order to bridge the time until the next Roman pilgrimage of all the ministers in the last two years, the District Church of Ministers of St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a several-day pilgrimage.</seg>
<seg id="5">Various pilgrimage destinations have been tested and finally decided on the Episcopal City of Freiburg, where this year, during the Holy Year of Mercy, the portal of mercy offered to the Bishop of Freiburg in Freiburg was a special pilgrimage destination.</seg>
<seg id="6">16 Minis, of Bittelbronn, and Gruene, and Haigerloch, and the rooms of the saints, went their way.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the evening, Fr. Storost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration at St. Anna, blessed the Pilgrims and distributed pilgrimages.</seg>
<seg id="8">From Horb, by train to the starting point Villingen, where also a Münster Unserer Lieben Frau stands and so the Pilgrimage was taken from the Muenster.</seg>
<seg id="9">The individual day tours were framed in the morning and evening, depending on a short impulse with various prayers, songs and texts.</seg>
<seg id="10">But also on the way, the Minis at field crossings, chapels, or churches began to sing together a song from specially assembled pilgrim songs.</seg>
<seg id="11">The parish offices of the local parishes were available for the overnight stays.</seg>
<seg id="12">At the stage targets Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller provided a tasty and well-starving dinner and breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="13">It continued on the second day about Furtwangen in the direction of Gütenbach.</seg>
<seg id="14">The day after we reached the stage to St. Peter, which was the most exhausting stretch of road, at first, some 500 metres of altitude had to be descended and then climbed again.</seg>
<seg id="15">The earned reward was a joint barbecue at Badweiher in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="16">After the morning pulse on the fourth pilgrimage in the impressive convent church of St. Peter, the final stage went to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="17">Visibly facilitated and happy the Minis arrived in Münster in the afternoon and went through the gate of mercy.</seg>
<seg id="18">With a little impulse God was thanked.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the evening Mass in Münster the Minis arrived at the pilgrimage destination by cooperator Markus Obert.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the divine service the pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and the high altar.</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner held the last evening in the male team sprint in the Velodrom in Rio for fame when the British team defended the London 2012 title.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor, which his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had done to Eigen. the boyfriend made the legend proud when he stormed home to win a victory from the favourites of New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after taking only a modest sixth place in March at the London runway world championships despite the withdrawal of Hoys.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the leader Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as a Hinder.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoy retired created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw potential in the Scots, which now has unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hinder, Kenny - the four years ago with Hoy victorious - and Skinner continued the qualifying laps in the qualifying laps, but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders won in the first lap.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hinder was barely back after his lap, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy made a major part of the transformation, in which Hindu drove in a higher gear to slow him down and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to keep the pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy looked at his position as BBC expert and dropped Skinner, Kenny and Hinder than they climbed onto the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "the 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said:" "" "it's a flattering comparison." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm only here to do my best and make me a name.</seg>
<seg id="17">We set up an Olympic ord in the final round and defeated the World Champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the 2012 triumph on the site of Kennys and Hoys, Hindu admitted that after a weak start he intentionally dropped onto the track.</seg>
<seg id="21">He later withdrew this statement and there was no objection to England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">With such an outstanding victory this time there was no such problem.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "Hinder said:" "" "it feels like the whole GB of flags on the tribune like London." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together as a team during the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We have so badly carried away with so many world titles that it was unbelievable to win back at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation winning seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If this is a barometer of our progress over the last five months, we expect successful five days in the Velodrom.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form Kenny it's in the realm of possible that he won tesys win from three Olympic Gold Medals in a contest.</seg>
<seg id="29">That would be for Kenny - who was 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (a seemingly holy date for British sports; on the day Steve Redwood, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be the same as Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny takes part in the sprint that starts today and will go over three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "the 28-year-old from Bolton said:" "" "I only enjoy this for the moment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a bit lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "Hinder said:" "" "if he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to a knight." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull met the fastest performance in the four-kilometer race.</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived in 3: 51,942 at the destination.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record, which won gold in 2012 in London, was at 3: 51,659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will take place on the second day of the competition where the focus will be on Wiggins.</seg>
<seg id="42">Yesterday he fought with commissioners before the qualification, when officials called him to measure his body size.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the corresponding women's competition, which will be continued and ended tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in world record time in 4: 13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB team relies on his strong railway team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to bring a throng of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly exceptional portrayal of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio have been shut down.</seg>
<seg id="46">There was drama in the background, so the resignation of Shane Sutton's technical director in April in the midst of sex and mobbing allegations as well as the retirement of size such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, if one looks at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrom, it looks as if the legendary reputation GBs, which reached its peak at the perfect moment, could be repeated again.</seg>

<seg id="1">Future of the melting shop of Portland due to the lifting of the energy contract questionable</seg>
<seg id="2">The future of the aluminium smelting of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workingmen - are at stake, as the system operator announces the energy supply contract and that all supply contracts will be raised, as the supplying energy company hastened.</seg>
<seg id="3">This step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies to operate the plant.</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy for 20 years runs in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2,000 jobs at the Alcoa Castle in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">No less than 2000 jobs - direct as well as indirect - could be at risk of closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, it could come to domino effects since the melting shop consumes around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Victorias.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014, Alcoa completed the point Henry enamel, which led to a closure of the Anglesea Kraftwerk last year.</seg>
<seg id="9">The melting shop of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows the years of speculation on the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and finally due to the electricity price for the plant.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, which supplies the large aluminum melt with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that three other owners will announce their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">The plant is owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese MarGeni Corp hold smaller shares.</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL believes that the plant in Portland will continue to operate, which means a further physical demand for electricity by the melt," said the company.</seg>
<seg id="14">AGL still said that the contracts were so-called "hedging transactions," which should come into force in November 2016.</seg>
<seg id="15">The contracts have a 12 month notice period so that they will end 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "therefore, AGL assumes that the contracts will contribute to revenue in the financial year 17," "" "said the electricity supplier." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential effects on the income on AGL from the GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong futures markets for wholesale electricity prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">AGL announced that the value of the contracts had already been written down in the amount of $187 million in "anticipation of termination."</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "Mr Alcoa said that the decision to withdraw the contracts, the" "" "Alcoas" ""... "ability to operate the melt or to ensure the power supply to the melt is not impaired." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">The U.S. company said it had concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, which would have come into force from November this year, even if it is still guilty of why it resigned from the contract.</seg>
<seg id="21">Analysts warn of the poor economic conditions in the industry before the possible closure of the Portland meltdown in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">In reference to the analysts "statements at the beginning of the week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland uses around 600 megawatts per year and around 900 MW of electricity a year.</seg>
<seg id="23">Should both systems disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the [electricity market].</seg>

<seg id="2">Kendall Jenner, 20, Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian Jenner Clans Kris is on the cover of the coveted September issue of the US Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="3">Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and ran at the Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced on Thursday the news on her Instagram account.</seg>
<seg id="4">"in a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover brought me to tears," Bandera.</seg>
<seg id="5">The cover of the cover followed a bizarre (or just keeping Up with the Kardashians similar?), critical reality video showing the entire Kardashian Jenner family (with the exception of Rob and Caitlyn's most popular show biz uncle and producers of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), which ended with a classical twist: they all planned a surprise party.</seg>
<seg id="6">This represents the stereotyped plot of nearly every birthday septic of a children's programme (Seacrest brought the sentence, "You thought we had forgotten you?," with the honesty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to let her other girls participate in this publicity somehow.</seg>
<seg id="7">With regard to the September issue of the Vogue, surely a new era of the caravan has begun.</seg>
<seg id="8">Charming's big sister Kim likes her, as far as the Vogue cover is concerned (she and her husband Kanye West have been looking forward to see it in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the journal is a league of itself.</seg>
<seg id="9">The September issue is for Vogue the most popular issue of the year.</seg>
<seg id="10">With a circumference resembling an illustrated book rather than a fashion journal, the issue is attracting a large number of advertisers (According to Fashionista the 832 pages of the novel are 615 pages advertising).</seg>
<seg id="11">The revelation of his coverstar is so eagerly awaited that in the last two years pictures of the magazine have leaked out before the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">Women already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "in recent years there have been clearly more" "" "celebrities, modal" "" "models, celebrities are" "" "on the cover" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">Oscar-winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, one year after Lady Gaga had the honour.</seg>
<seg id="15">But even with the small chance that Mrs. Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls under the former category, she is in good company.</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to famous persons or reality stars or young people of today who know how to shoot a good Snapchat video (even though everything applies to Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the publication of Lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="19">Of course, Jenny's success doesn't suit everyone.</seg>
<seg id="20">With their reality TV history, Jenny's position in the fashion world was always tense.</seg>
<seg id="21">In June, the former Victoria's Secret-Model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized and called them "the buggers of the moment."</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings came up again when the news came out with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue Cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">But to get around on the mom seems to pass the point.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is a supermodel in the truest sense of the word.</seg>
<seg id="26">She runs for Marc Jacobs.</seg>
<seg id="27">It makes advertising for your primer by Estee Lauder.</seg>
<seg id="28">They and all their sisters sell pictures of themselves on their respective paywall apps.</seg>
<seg id="29">She sells her handmade pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter to the magazine WTV.</seg>
<seg id="30">And in her free time she is seen in reality TV. presumably only to see her sister Kourtney and her children.</seg>

<seg id="3">The successors dominate the world today - his maker experienced a disaster.</seg>
<seg id="4">The device weighed almost half a kilo and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was thicker and bigger, therefore it was not good at hand.</seg>
<seg id="6">On the contrary, it was rather clumsy.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the beginning, the built-in memory used to be eight megabytes, which would reach for about two selfies at high resolution today.</seg>

<seg id="13">In fact, the new mobile phone could be sent and received for those standards a lot: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, also via fax the communicator was to be reached.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even access to web pages was possible via HTML-browser, although slow.</seg>
<seg id="15">A pocket calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.</seg>
<seg id="16">There was a small antenna, and the mobile phone could be folded similar to a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then there was a small keyboard and a black-and-white screen.</seg>
<seg id="18">The price was quite proud: 2700 D-Mark, thus about 1400 Euros.</seg>
<seg id="19">The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="20">No one could suspect in August 1996 that the Communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era.</seg>

<seg id="4">The Olympics brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End.</seg>
<seg id="5">And that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">We will provide 10.000 new apprenticeships for our local communities alone, create 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment.</seg>

<seg id="8">I have been told that England will never be ready for games and that we will flake up on the world stage.</seg>

<seg id="14">Now they are ready to provide a third catwalk, which is supported by £16 billion in private investment.</seg>
<seg id="15">The 2012 London Olympic Games were a great success for GB and I am confident that Heathrow's enlargement will also be one.</seg>

<seg id="3">On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block display blockages on its desktop, Adblock Plus published a blog post, in which it shared that users could update their filters in the program in order to again block advertising on the social network.</seg>
<seg id="4">On Tuesday, Facebook announced that his desktop site would change coding on its advertisements, to make it difficult to detect which part of the page is advertising.</seg>

<seg id="6">In a blog post, the spokesman of Adblock Ben Williams stated that "this kind of hin-and-fro struggle between the antimelting open source community and the conversions has been in progress since the invention of indicator lamps," and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Venus was probably inhabitable according to the projections of a new NASA climate model.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies at NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate scientists.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether Venus could once have erdallied conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-tight atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously indicated that the slow turn of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation hints at the fact that Venus could have had a thin, erdlike atmosphere and still slowly spinning.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably referred more dry areas than de Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to house life and protected from rapid evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation, the slow turn of Venus increases its day-span of the Sun for almost two months," explained GISS Scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the sun's heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than that of the earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model produced a history of Venus that resembles the evolution previously suspected of planetary scientists.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was probably inhabitable, Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light over the course of several billion years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans were evaporated and their water vapor was blown away by ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">As their hydrogen escaped only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide back with a fatal greenhouse effect -- Venus, which as we know it today.</seg>

<seg id="2">The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope helped astronomers collect the most complete catalogue of rotational rates among the stars of the Pleiades cluster.</seg>
<seg id="3">The new data help astronomers understand why stars in the star cluster rotate to different rates and in what context the rotation time periods are associated with planetary origin.</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope that by comparing our results with other star cluster, we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="5">The cluster of stars of the Pleiades lies 445 light-years from the earth.</seg>
<seg id="6">Many stars in this cluster of stars, which originated approximately 125 million years ago, are now reaching adulthood.</seg>
<seg id="7">They are now turning the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="8">At peak-rotational rates these ripening stars collide large amounts of star-winds.</seg>
<seg id="9">As these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.</seg>
<seg id="10">When a star is aged, its rotation rate begins to slow down.</seg>
<seg id="11">Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a visible star spot -- like sunspots --.</seg>
<seg id="12">The latest catalogue of rotational rates indicates that more massive stars rotate more slowly than less massive stars.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rebull compares the stars with dancers, with bigger stars slower pirouettes than smaller ones.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the" Ballet "of the Pleiades, we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," Rebull said.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since the cluster of the Pleiades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotation-rats.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the cluster of stars of the Pleiades offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stellar rotation in both directions, both younger and older," said Rebull.</seg>
<seg id="17">There is still a lot to learn about how, when and why stars slow down their rotation rates and hang up their "dance shoes" so to speak.</seg>

<seg id="1">Datenklau: so perfide blackmail her ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmer of blackmail malware is currently attacking businesses - and they are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey by the malware defense specialists Malwarebytes among 540 enterprises in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of surveyed companies were at least once in the past twelve months, sometimes multiple victims of an attack with blackmail software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, almost 20 percent of companies were already the target of a ransomware blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ransom demanded by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the systems and data challenged.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialize their blackmail software according to the observations of Malwarebytes enthusiastically on attacks in corporate networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potential to blackmail is significantly higher than in private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "we currently watch a terrifying rapid evolution of the malware," "" "explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the" "" "world." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008, most of the Malwareprograms were still designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">Only private users were the target, but the change to corporate attacks took place in the past months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works following a simple pattern: once active on a victim's computer, it searches for unused files like Word, Excel or database files, as well as archives of images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the ransomware and deletes the originals lastingly.</seg>
<seg id="14">The software then presents the demands of the blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="15">To get the final key code to the files, the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of cryptocurrencies Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, where the personal photo database is at stake in private users, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases without which production stops.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage is incurred when a ransomware is struck.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of the affected German companies reported revenue losses through Ransomware, 13 percent even had to completely disrupt business operation, in one case people were in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">Several hospitals have already been victims of attacks in Germany, whose patients can be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we always tell the victims:" "" "do not pay, you only promote the problem," "" "explains Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay, get their data back.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetrators in the face of standstill in operation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers in turn know this and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, the investigators of F-Secure investigated the user interface and contact with the blackmail and come to the conclusion: the perpetrators actually attempt to build a kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They explain their victims through chat as they can pay via Bitcoin, set up freely accessible support sites or decrypt vain for example files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And when private miners are redeemed by a few hundred euro, companies have to negotiate heavily and pay five-digit amounts to recover their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">In view of the potentially high and relatively risky gains from the ransomware blackmail, the hackers become more and more professional and share the work, explained safety expert Chester Wisniewski from the antivirus provider SOPHOS: "a single person can write a ransomware for roughly within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">However, it is more likely that these are three or four persons.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers then sell their malicious software in the form of a software package to the actual blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="30">The so-called malware kit has been created by selling malware, advice and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between $1000 and $10,000.</seg>
<seg id="31">"the scope of delivery includes an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmail then searches for more hackers to distribute the newly bought software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service sector.</seg>
<seg id="34">So one logs in one of the boards in the underground, buys the set from a criminal and instructs one more to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is per certified calculator.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually the criminals then commission a spammer with spreading," Wisniewski declares.</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now well-known for many companies that better protect their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 percent of the companies IT managers in the Malwarebytes survey trust to repel Ransomware by file-back-ups and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful measures, the perpetrators threaten to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," "" "explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">Thus, depending on the type of data, the potential for damage is much higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">The perpetrators could also take completely new targets on the internet of things in the future.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the Hackerkonferenz, Defcon, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the internet under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of the winter, the activation of such a blocked heat could well be worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators then instead of heating in the future block an entire production line in a factory, Ransomware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="3">In the small HR-V, Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupe and even the versatility of a minivan.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sounds rather overloaded, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although the only 1.60 m high HR-V seems rather small, the passengers have a lot of space both in the first row and in the rear.</seg>
<seg id="6">The materials of the interior are well finished and have a pleasant effect, only the cockpit upper side is falling apart.</seg>

<seg id="9">This is less magical when it sounds: the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like Kinosessel and thus offer storage space, which is up to 1.24 m high from the floor to the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="10">The trunk can be loaded well, but the load height of 650 mm is slightly higher than in the comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerfully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, he is likely to make his work a bit quieter.</seg>
<seg id="13">The daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is gratifying.</seg>
<seg id="14">There is another engine version: a 1.5 litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp.</seg>
<seg id="15">A four-wheel drive is not offered.</seg>
<seg id="16">The driving behavior is balanced, a good compromise between dynamism and comfort.</seg>
<seg id="17">But the steering should be a bit more direct.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "the equipment in the tested top version" "" "Executive" "" "leaves nothing to be desired." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">The security systems belong to the City emergency brake assist (works up to speed 32), the collision warning system and the lane keeping assistant.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "the collision warning sometimes irritates because it evaluates many obstacles as" "" "approaching objects" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">The high-beam assistant works very reliably.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent speed controller responds to traffic sign detection and throtates the speed if required.</seg>
<seg id="23">The full connectivity is available only for the top features: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation device, app integration and more.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB- and one HDMI socket lie beneath the armrest and are therefore somewhat cumbersome to achieve.</seg>
<seg id="25">The approximately 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are fine.</seg>
<seg id="26">Those who don't want to invest so much will get the gasoline engine from 20000 Euro, the diesel from 23,000 euros.</seg>

<seg id="1">Relaxing Nights: tips for Sleep Disorders</seg>
<seg id="2">In the evening you roll yourself around forever, at night you lie awake for hours, in the morning you can no longer think of sleep before the wake up.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one is in good company with such problems: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of the adult sleep problems and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently than not relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep disturbances manifest?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disorders, and many causes may be based on them, says Hans-Günter Bake, member of the board of the German Association for sleep control and sleeping medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">But what one understands provisionally, however, is the insomnia, that is, an insomnia disorder.</seg>
<seg id="8">Especially the sleeping experience affects many people as unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board at the Deutsches HausDiagnostegemeinschaft with practice in Varel, Lower Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind it can contain organic, mental or behavioural factors, but also medicines.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not infrequently the sleep problem is an expression of another condition.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "very early waking is most common in depression," "" "says Weak." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors condition each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">Who, for example, has a herniated disc, can lie poorly, wakes up every two to three hours and possibly starts to pondering about everyday problems and worries, there is an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should I become a doctor with sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="18">Those who don't sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and are affected in the day should go to the doctor, throw the blast.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look quite different: one is tired, tired, sleepy, has difficulties with the attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical ailments such as stomach or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">To alleviate your sleep disturbance, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">Treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy, or medicines - classical sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - inquired.</seg>
<seg id="22">Dr. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary dormitory medicine center of the Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin, is hardly available in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is why you should contact the family doctor in case of sleep problems.</seg>
<seg id="24">This can be clarified by examining whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep lab and what happens there?</seg>
<seg id="26">For the examination in the sleep lab, doctors advise doctors, for example, in snoring with respiratory setters, in case of sickness-like fatigue, for sleep transformers or if the cause of a disturbance disturbance fails, Fietze explains.</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "please do not make a nap," "" "says Fietze." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">After gluing, you go to bed at its normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Besides the electrodes on the body, one carries a nose goggles, a chest strap and a feeler at the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera on the ceiling is indicative of sleeping.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can sufferers get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of adjusting screws where you can sleep for better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">Whether you sleep in bed, do not sleep long in bed, do not sleep on the day, avoid alcohol, and don't look at the watch at night - then you start to count immediately, and that's not conducive to it.</seg>

<seg id="2">Professional thieves at Düsseldorf Airport</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "" "" "civilian investigators of the Düsseldorf police managed to capture two women and two men aged 50 to 61." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">The suspects had committed several bags and baggage steels as a gang.</seg>
<seg id="5">At 9.30 p.m. civil servants in the area of Düsseldorf Airport recognised a gang that was known to policemen of past theft victims.</seg>
<seg id="6">The two women and two men had committed several offences since the middle of July of this year and have been commonplace, labour-friendly and especially professional.</seg>
<seg id="7">The specialists of the detective bureau 34 can demonstrate four acts, which were submitted specifically for the offence of criminal offences to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="8">At the same time, they had exploited about 15,000 euro.</seg>

<seg id="1">Old buildings, some linden trees, occasionally a rest of cobblestones: the Riga street in Berlin-Friedrichshain looks not like at first sight, but the police counts them to the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">If one goes along the road from east to west, one passes through playgrounds, a fresch-painted kindergarten and a biolades.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "someone" "" "ugly!" "" "has sprayed on the façade of a grey house." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">Opposite a Lidl, which will soon be demolished, is already built: by 2017, a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here.</seg>
<seg id="5">Articles about this "trendy neighbourhood," as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls, are, however, preferred in recent weeks with burning cars.</seg>
<seg id="6">Reason is the house with number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents have rent contracts, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Especially the Berlin inner senator handle had spoken several times for a hard action by the police against the project since the beginning of the year, the area as a "no-go zone" for policemen and 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">After having been evacuated on June 22nd, the premises on the ground floor, the cadet smiths, with 300 police officers, had patrolled out official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site, locked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, on behalf of the unknown homeowners, the building workers renovated the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court ruled that the clearance had been illegal, and a day later, police and construction workers relocated under the jubilation of sympathisers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this afternoon the street looks peaceful: parents go for a walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others entertain themselves in late late afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the house projects there is a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in the neighbourhood since 1999, and Jana *, who has three children here since 1999, is particularly annoyed by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the house projects, they share the concern for rising rents and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It does not sound like a Kiez, who mostly wanted police protection against vandalism.</seg>
<seg id="16">The trench, which the Berlin interior senator and the police have between the occupiers and their neighbors, apparently does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the east of Berlin, Friedrichshain was actually a traditional workers "quarter, which also has a low average income and a high risk of poverty in comparison to the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="18">In 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including nearly all Mainzer Straße in the vicinity of the Rīga.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer was evacuated under large police command in a regular street battle, many of the projects were legalized in Riga and are still inhabited by the people they occupied 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the district has become increasingly magnet for tourists and elective Berliners from all over the world over the last few years: now residents from GDR times and former home occupants share their neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also noticeable in the rents that have risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Rīga are being attacked as symbols for this development: one recognizes them on the drained windows or freshly painted facades, which were thrown with color bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other street was mentioned this year together with the words "left autonomous power."</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason for not all neighbours to consider this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by criminality: according to statistics, criminal offences such as bodily injury are almost exclusively directed against police officers.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most of the offences do damage, which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">There can be no question of uncertainty for Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a tenant near the disputed 94 for 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="27">As far as violence is concerned, it is appetizing: the people in the 94 are their neighbours who were certainly not.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars are no longer available right away in Riga.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "for the architect, her street is not a criminal focus, on the contrary:" "" "here one helps one another, lives together on the street and gets more of each other than elsewhere." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer has deliberately drawn into the street of Riga - and has remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">That is why it was so important that the residents got back their streets: from the police, politics and the media, who all of a sudden claimed the deutungshoheit across the district.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of the inhabitants like Neugebauer, the road continues to be taken away: through faceless reconstructions in former buildings, which displace the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "these are property-style apartments that are not interesting for many - here are rather people who are not so well searched," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "I absolutely cannot approve violence and destruction." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what to do if someone never listens to someone?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is frustration on all sides, even with the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">For newcomers who fret about color bombs, Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: the house projects and the left-hand scene belonged to the neighbourhood.</seg>
<seg id="38">Those who come from should be aware of this - just like someone who moves into a pub, can complain badly there about noise.</seg>
<seg id="39">All persons presented with first names have asked not to be named with their correct name.</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is a new Commissioner for Refugees</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person in matters of integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also a social worker on site.</seg>
<seg id="4">Annika Deuschle has been the Refugee Commissioner for Urbach since July.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogue supports the team of the Achim Grockenberger administration.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees herself as a contact person for all actors: refugees, working group, refugee aid, administration, authorities and anyone else involved.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine customer of the working group indicated that the volunteers are more than thankful that Deuschle is now there, the unskilled Wollmchsau, who has a problem above all.</seg>
<seg id="8">In this way, some - less spotless than on the multitude of demanded tasks - meant that the administration wanted to leave the place.</seg>
<seg id="9">Looking for an administrative professional with a talent for languages and people, combined with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, just a cutting-down Wollmchsau.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not its central area, says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">First of all, it is about organization, work with local people and also behind the scenes as well as networking activities.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent stake in three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "it was high time," "" "says Regine customer that Annika Deuschle supports honest and full-time players." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">There are big and minor problems, organizational, human and communication problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon new containers are available at Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">A serious problem has been, for some time, to find apartments for the connecting flights that have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for the connection provision.</seg>
<seg id="19">You must place the refugees in their own or rented apartments.</seg>
<seg id="20">The costs of the construction, rent or renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the communes themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the district council to the Commune and Jobcenters.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every owner wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time now.</seg>
<seg id="24">In fact, administration does not find any private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">So far, it does not work, so be instructed on private dwellings, says Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, common dwellings must be infamous as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers will be set up in the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a permanent residence, there are internships, apprenticeships, school grounds, one-euro jobs and support activities for refugees and migrants who need to be repaired or furnished.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," says Regine customer.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help homemasters, do non-profit work - and that motivates and very tidy, as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "this is" "" "no occupational therapy" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a solid structure, say Deuschle and client.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">So it needs offers such as sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So also jump here Administration and Volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They have to explain to the refugees that it takes time and they can bridge the time sensibly, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Those who develop the feeling at some point can't help in Urbach, do not work and be useless, he will never integrate.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority was motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"" "but there are also problems," "" "says customer honestly," "" "people with whom nothing goes." "" "the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always also motivating others." ""</seg>
<seg id="47">"" "all this is already a" "" "mammoth task" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: do the two have fear of radicalization after the recent events, even in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "says Regine customer quite clearly," "" "what some naive call" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitised.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also the topic of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the assassins were completely discarded.</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," "" "says Regine customer." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So main and volunteers must look for activities locally and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">They always have in the background that a new shock to refugees and migrants might soon come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a upper limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">To answer this question clearly, politics abhors itself.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually it is unfair to put them on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach, we have not yet arrived where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would relax the situation.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urbach is already busy with it, to integrate the existing people sensibly.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently around 100 people, mostly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But if people are in need, they have to help them, both women agree.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.</seg>
