Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
the two wanted to speak about the implementation of the international agreement as well as about Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s destabili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
at the meeting , however , it should also be about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement construction and advoc@@ ates Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
the deal between the two has deterior@@ ated further by the deal raised by Obama about Iran &apos;s nuclear programme .
in March , at the invitation of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , Net@@ any@@ ahu was given a controversial talk at the US Congress , which was partly considered an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not discussed with Obama , a meeting had rejected this meeting with reference to the election im@@ min@@ ent in Israel .
in an emergency call professor to have shot his girlfriend
in an emergency call Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told with a somewhat c@@ ud@@ ent voice of the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officers would have to come to his house .
Lamb was important to stress that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably ag@@ itated and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone .
inside the house the officials found the cor@@ p@@ ses of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note , scri@@ b@@ ble on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted to reverse it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman that ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb , who was in two online courses for Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already travelled for 300 miles to the school premises , where according to the police , he had shot and killed a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University police chief Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb had made the cat@@ astrop@@ hic call at some point thereafter .
until the end of the day there was another death : Lamb took the life when the police en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed him .
one day after the shooting in the university , students and teachers forced to hide behind closed doors , authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb motivated .
the details , published by investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and staff who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teacher .
students said they were looking forward to his lessons .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he had no history of violence or a criminal pre@@ history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both taught in the Social Sciences and History Department , whose faculty includes 17 members , and many students attended courses from both .
at the same time , there were some tendencies to problematic practices .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised Lamb , said he seemed a little nervous and nervous as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University to leave for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
this year , he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the doctorate , for whom Lamb had worked so hard , would not represent a guarantee for an automatic path to an employment as Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ p &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those are questions that Lamb cannot answer any more .
after the run out of the campus , the police later found Lam@@ p &apos;s lane when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as again .
before he could be arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson .
his car was still in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that she believes that he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew up in the area .
Lamb started his work at the university in 2009 , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and ped@@ agog@@ y .
he obtained his doctorate in the spring of ped@@ agog@@ y .
one of the long @-@ time friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charism@@ atic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met through common friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar playing .
at that time he was the s@@ warm of women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all the girls mel@@ ted away when he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and lives in the Jackson subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously together some time together .
in the emergency call Lamb said , &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; but there was no certificate of a marriage .
they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house adjoining a ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said she had been divor@@ ced 15 years ago but friends stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was totally destroyed by the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he had never met Lamb , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues .
Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail rose on a summer fair three years ago .
later they played together the one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked for different companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a poorly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said he saw Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night on September 5th for the last time after Lamb had finished his guitar and mou@@ th@@ piece playing before a spar@@ se audience .
there was no indication that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were in the clearing and jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , headed the first @-@ semester seminar program and specialised in American natives and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at school .
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of his Fr@@ at@@ ernity and the student committee .
on Tuesday evening about 900 people including lec@@ turers , staff , students and members of the community participated in a candle light memorial at the Delta State campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and .
Sch@@ mid@@ ts &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the vi@@ gil , while the university choir &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and Ama@@ zing Grace sang .
the lessons will resume on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we try to move our students back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Rog@@ eli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
Associ@@ ated Press authors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now says that Lamb had made the call after he had shot Schmidt , and that he described Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife in his emergency call , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .
Toys R Us plans to hire less workforce for Christmas time
Toys R Us tells us that it won &apos;t be as many Christmas seasonal workers as last year , but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will give the current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours .
the company said it plans to hire 40,000 people in stores and sales centers throughout the country . in the 2014 Christmas season , 45@@ ,000 workers were hired .
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said it will start with job interviews this month , increasing the number of employees from October to December .
while the holidays are still months away , the Christmas business approaches , and companies are preparing to hire time workers to equip stores with employees who sell , ship and deliver products .
Michael J. Fox interpre@@ ts his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we were sitting in the theatre waiting for the Roy@@ als , and I realize that the seat next to me is empty , and it gradually becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an im@@ pending documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film starts , and it comes to my mind that I &apos;m a simulated glow and a length of arm from being with the princess of Wales on a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about Back to the Future , presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , and with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really is for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unden@@ i@@ ably the biggest time travel film ever made . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be scre@@ ened on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected movie theaters in October .
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says that his response to Russia &apos;s reinforced military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five @-@ year conflict , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people .
the UN chief again calls upon all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution .
ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Britain and France - on the margins of the General Assembly of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he depl@@ ored that the divisions in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation in@@ soluble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in tackl@@ ing the crisis in Syria , which they proved in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran . &quot; &quot; &quot;
8 survey values that show that Donald Tru@@ mp is taken seriously .
some have tried to brand him on the flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
but no matter how some Rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tru@@ mp from the upper ranks in surveys , it hasn &apos;t worked yet .
ten of the last eleven National Sur@@ ve@@ ys showed Donald Tru@@ mp in the double @-@ digit range , and some start to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nom@@ in@@ ating the real estate Mog@@ ul .
of course , it is still too early in the election period .
nobody claims that Tru@@ mp will probably win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts emphasize that at this time in 2011 Rick Per@@ ry &apos;s leadership was given to the rising hero Cain , none of which won only one state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders like J@@ eb Bus@@ h@@ s Super PA@@ C and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognize Tru@@ mp@@ s staying power and begin to let their dollars flow to t@@ opp@@ le him .
here are some current survey values indicating that the real estate Mog@@ ul is not only a temporary phase :
Tru@@ mp@@ s popularity values have turned 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tru@@ mp announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey conducted by the Mon@@ mouth @-@ University showed that only two out of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans saw the real estate Mog@@ ul positive .
by mid @-@ July , it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August , it was 52 percent .
now six out of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tru@@ mp .
about three out of ten say that they have a negative opinion .
and these figures hold themselves in early states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa reported last week that 60 percent of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two thirds of the GO@@ P voters would be happy with Tru@@ mp as candidates .
in a CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey last week , 67 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans said they were either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; when Tru@@ mp was nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two out of 10 say they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he was the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son creates approximately the same enthusiasm as Tru@@ mp ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; enthusiastic &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about Tru@@ mp ) .
the next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand 47 percent of the Republi@@ can voters say they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if Y@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans don &apos;t see Tru@@ mp@@ s temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tru@@ mp is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive remarks , 52 percent of Irish voters think that real estate Mog@@ ul has the right temp@@ er for a president , &quot; says ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is valid in the first pres@@ election state of the nation , I@@ owa State where the same 52 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a supreme commander , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to effectively carry out his office , and almost six out of ten independ@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament didn &apos;t fit into the White House , says ABC / Post .
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
when they set up their money @-@ hats , Republi@@ can voters hold Tru@@ mp for real .
if they are asked who is most likely to win the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , according to a survey by CN@@ N / OR@@ C from last week , four out of ten say that Tru@@ mp is the best bet .
this is a change from the time when four from ten end of July put their money at J@@ eb &apos;s Bush .
complete disclosure : in the past , GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball .
at this point in the last cycle four out of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination compared to only 28 % for final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
yet it is evident that a large number of GO@@ P voters look at Tru@@ mp@@ s campaign as plau@@ sible .
even if the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans were gathering around another candidate , Tru@@ mp still beats almost everyone .
some experts point out that the spl@@ inter@@ ed field probably contributes to tru@@ mp leadership while the anti @-@ tru@@ mp support is diff@@ used on more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey conducted by the Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ on @-@ head race between Tru@@ mp and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tru@@ mp re@@ aps the majority support .
he got 13 points ahead of Cin@@ ches Fi@@ or@@ ina , ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ therine and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it is a head @-@ on @-@ head @-@ race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ in @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tru@@ mp fans say they have formed their opinion .
a new survey by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only a little over half the voters who support Tru@@ mp say they have strongly forgiven their votes .
of course much can happen to change that , and no one can really say never change the mind .
46 percent said they let the door open to move to other candidates .
nevertheless Tru@@ mp@@ s is strongest competition at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their opinion are twice as common for Tru@@ mp .
six out of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that they agree with Tru@@ mp on the subject of immigration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since Donald Tru@@ mp was nick@@ named &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rap@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his election campaign two months ago , immigration was a pi@@ vot@@ al place in the public discourse in 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tru@@ mp decisi@@ vely re@@ strain His@@ pan@@ o Americans from the Republi@@ can Party and will damage the re@@ orientation efforts .
but according to the new ABC / Post @-@ pol@@ l on Monday , six out of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that they agree with Tru@@ mp on questions of immigration .
so long as immigration remains in the li@@ mel@@ ight , Donald Tru@@ mp seems to be doing too .
fru@@ stration over the government climbs to new high@@ s .
Donald Tru@@ mp and Ben Car@@ son now account for about half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , especially through their out@@ si@@ ders status .
six out of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans are saying in the new Mon@@ days survey by ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider than anyone with experience in government .
and they are also fur@@ ious about Washington .
a survey conducted by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa , two weeks ago , shows that three out of four I@@ owa rep@@ ublic@@ ans are frustr@@ ated by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 per cent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 per cent . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
here in the look@@ out path is the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the North Sea .
the road costs a square meter of a re@@ turn@@ table with an average of 7@@ 3.@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt , the offer of objects is naturally limited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says in the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows in which special locations a square meter is the most cost .
of course , 18.@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student book in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top places of residence , however , the price is like pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; Völ@@ kers has published a ranking list of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of euros - per square metre , well @-@ marked .
but good , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not at the top as an exception .
champi@@ ons League : Bavaria dream start thanks to Müller and Götz@@ e
double keeper in Pi@@ raeus : Bayern star Thomas Müller has just one run .
a happy hit by Thomas Müller paved the way for FC Bayern 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ raeus - then it ran .
a supreme pr@@ el@@ ude to the Champions League season .
world Champion Thomas Müller and Mario Götz@@ e have brought a dream start to FC Bayern in the ro@@ cket boat of Pi@@ raeus .
the team of Trainer P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won her kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the Greek record master Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and Götz@@ e matches ( 8@@ 9th ) earned at 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth consecutive success in series is to be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy where Guardi@@ ola finally wants to catch the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich .
at his 28th matches in the Champions League , Müller received gra@@ cious assistance from Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ go@@ al@@ er@@ den Roberto , who made an impression of the world champion &apos;s shot as a flan@@ k .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had promised Bayern @-@ captain Philipp Lah@@ m ahead of the play at the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich held words . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated idea , without shining .
Pi@@ raeus had won his last six home games in the King &apos;s class , including well @-@ known clubs like Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund also stum@@ bled here ( 1 : 3 ) .
but the Bav@@ arians , un@@ defeated in seven European @-@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they went gra@@ c@@ efully , but often too resour@@ ceful in their offensive efforts .
the attacks were often triggered by game shift on the left side Douglas Costa , who rarely crossed the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck from the right when his flan@@ k from the right half @-@ field hit the left upper tor@@ ch@@ id .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion promised the possible 2 : 0 .
the best opportunities in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first , when Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ storms Ide@@ ye Brown struck the pole of Poland from the line ( 26 ) .
then by direct tak@@ eover , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto was bow@@ ing with his knee ( 35@@ th ) .
although the Bav@@ arians moved up their usual dominant game , Pi@@ raeus was able to pick up needle @-@ stick .
on go@@ al@@ keepers Manuel Neu@@ er , however , was reli@@ eved .
so , for example , when he ste@@ ered a shot of Ide@@ ye over the l@@ atin ( 5@@ 6th ) .
before Neu@@ er Guardi@@ ola defended a four @-@ chain with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng who made it well .
Mario Götz@@ e , after muscular problems back in the cad@@ re , was sitting outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero only gave the green light after the final training , said Sport@@ expert Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who wants to make something different from it is already malign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even at the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an to the beaten Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) .
i@@ dol arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made it clear 13 minutes later , Müller added one .
before the game it was at the stadium in Kra@@ w@@ allen .
after a smaller group of partly confused Bayern fans in their on@@ look@@ ers block apparently provoked the supporters of Pi@@ raeus with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces attacked and went with clas@@ hes against the Munich fans .
at least one Bayern fan was injured by the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
who smo@@ kes , does not only harm the lungs , but also the teeth - this suggests a long @-@ term study .
the good news : in case of reno@@ unc@@ ement , the risk decreases rapidly .
smo@@ kers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several members of the German Institute for Nutri@@ tional Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smo@@ kers , smo@@ kers have the risk of pre@@ mat@@ urely losing their teeth in order to increase the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 times higher .
the scientists had watched more than 23,@@ 300 participants .
the main causes of tooth decay are c@@ aries and inflammation of the gum , emphas@@ ises the DI@@ f@@ E .
smoking is a risk factor for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , the authors emphas@@ ise .
the connection between smoking and loss of teeth is therefore reduced to more frequent gum infections in smo@@ kers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking also increases the risk of c@@ aries .
people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk in a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
however , it could take over ten years before the endanger@@ ment goes back to the level of non @-@ smo@@ kers , explained Er@@ du@@ l Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham .
one must persu@@ ade people to become non @-@ smo@@ kers , explained Professor H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking reduces life time . &quot;
not to smoke is good for lungs and vessels and , according to our findings , results in a good dental health up to the age of old .
in Germany over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years of too@@ th@@ lessness has been affected by the DI@@ f@@ E .
earlier studies had already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early loss of teeth .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ pin the findings .
arch@@ e@@ ologists come across the Rhine shores based on rem@@ nants of the late Anti@@ quity
archaeological finds have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne for the repeated time .
in the vicinity of the construction site for the new Rhine Boulevard , archae@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic @-@ Museum have excav@@ ated skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , told the museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine , historians are searching for so @-@ called soil monuments .
in all building projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always considered as an expert for archaeological excav@@ ation .
in the third construction phase of the Rhine bou@@ levard , the arch@@ e@@ ologists were now found .
Trier was already known from text documents that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century stood a church .
in addition to rem@@ nants of the fortress and the church tower , there was also a cemetery with around 350 graves which probably belonged to the church .
young woman caught by freight train
after a young woman has rap@@ ed the station at the train station in Horn@@ lenk@@ ir@@ chen @-@ Lin@@ dern , the Federal Police asked the people for help .
early Wednesday morning at 1.@@ 40 pm the woman crossed the tracks towards the station building at the end of the platform and was captured by a freight train coming from Mön@@ ch@@ eng@@ lad@@ bach .
according to the Federal Police , it carried out serious injuries by collecting the train .
she was treated with emergency medical care and taken to a hospital by rescue forces .
on the basis of the noc@@ tur@@ nal crossing of the young woman there is no evidence to the des@@ ti@@ tu@@ te officials .
the incident was possibly observed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic percep@@ tions .

European Commission proposes new court in dispute over TT@@ IP
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to intensi@@ fy the dispute over the planned Trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement , the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controversial private arbit@@ ration facilities for disputes between companies and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its functionality is significantly more traditional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens trust , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström in the performance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swe@@ de has proposed introducing the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced support .
TT@@ IP is the world &apos;s largest free trade zone with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans for reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceeding specifically envis@@ age that the EU states and the US jointly select independent judges for a new Investment Court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should come from the EU , the US and third countries .
for the first time there is also a second instance .
it would allow it to appeal obj@@ ections .
so far the proceedings took place among each other on arbitr@@ ators , there was no possibility of objection to their judgments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the debate over the past few months , it has become clear that citizens did not trust the old IS@@ DS system in terms of fair@@ ness and justice , commented on Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , it wants to work towards an International Investment Court according to its own specifications .
there may , for example , also resolve disputes between Chinese companies and EU states .
the investor state arbit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) , required above all by major corporations , are considered to be one of the main reasons for the great opposition in Europe against TT@@ IP .
traditional arbit@@ ral tri@@ bun@@ als are critici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parallel judi@@ ci@@ ary , on which companies initiate damages to tax@@ pay@@ ers , bul@@ bs national legislation , or to enforce a lowering of consumer and environmental standards .
in the first statements , anti @-@ TT@@ IP organizations such as Camp@@ act described the European Commission &apos;s proposals as inadequate .
above all it was critic@@ ised that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
on the other hand , the German Minister of Economy , Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , described the plans as a big step forward .
the Commission included essential points for reform , which Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Sig@@ mar Gabriel has worked out with other EU trade ministers in spring .
the old system of private arbit@@ ral tri@@ bun@@ als is from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European business association B@@ US@@ IN@@ ES@@ S@@ EURO@@ PE warned against limiting the law@@ suits of the economy by too many new rules .
in this way , especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged , it was said .
when the talks on the TT@@ IP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) trade agreement were concluded , it remained unclear on Wednesday .
the negotiations have been underway since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the subject of investor protection has not been discussed with the US until now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this date is considered to be no longer sustainable .
delicate Folk by Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage in the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart illustr@@ ating the picturesque American country Mich@@ ig@@ an with felt pen .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost taken by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he tells stories of various places he always records on the map about his meticul@@ ous and delic@@ ately arranged songs .
where they originated and how it looks there , in his homeland .
since then St@@ ev@@ ens has proven to be a wonderful creative person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the third album &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ ig@@ an : the Great Lake State &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published in 2003 , clever@@ ly composed songs that blend harmon@@ i@@ ously with American folk of the late six@@ ties , but can be dri@@ fted into great opul@@ ent at any time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the ru@@ mor that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mich@@ ig@@ an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be the first part of a disgu@@ ised series : each of the 50 U.S. states should be con@@ stru@@ ed as a result . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but already in 2004 and near the Rhine , &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; has already appeared and breaks positively certain expectations .
St@@ ev@@ ens can be reduced here .

exu@@ ber@@ ant with ideas and styli@@ stic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the US Bill@@ board Charts and is missing in no yearly list of influential music media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after extremely productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens then relies on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2010 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sixth ti@@ dy studio album is still widely orchest@@ rated , but carried out by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effects and rever@@ b .

although almost 2000 guests are sitting in their chairs , the plain@@ tive St@@ ev@@ ens comes back to intim@@ acy and folk .
without making a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians is playing through the wide @-@ enriched album .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the audience you hear that the lecture is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and one can therefore throw away the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; disk in essence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ gest@@ unde
since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ gest@@ unde is expected to be eag@@ erly awa@@ ited .
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n is scheduled to give his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ gest@@ unde to make his debut with David Cameron for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to put the first of his six pres@@ et questions shortly after noon , with his performance examined by the media probably and the Labour MEPs from nearby .
he called for &quot; less theaters and more facts &quot; during this weekly event .
he also said that he could skip some sessions to leave them to colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the Shadow Cab@@ inet and after his speech at the TU@@ C meeting on Tuesday .
in the meantime , during a commem@@ oration ceremony celebrating the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to remain silent during a commem@@ oration ceremony on the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has provoked a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs and is at the centre of several news stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n spokes@@ man said he had been &quot; in respect@@ ful silence , &quot; and he recognized the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s shadow cab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told in the BBC Two news night program , he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be aboli@@ shed .
nearly a dozen of Shadow @-@ Ministers have refused to serve in the Mr Cor@@ by@@ n leadership and they are referring to differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary party originally supported him as a leader .
the Political Cor@@ respon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also &quot; st@@ acked &quot; within Labour , according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s remarks on the position of the European Union and the limitation of profits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C Conference to set up Labour Chan@@ ges to remove the whole idea of a limitation altogether .
hours later Mr Smith said , the shadow worker and pensions minister said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against the government plans to reduce the limitation of £ 26.@@ 000 to £ 23@@ ,000 .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron ever since he is a ory leader over the last decade over the Dis@@ patch box in the Parliament .
the Labour leader , who promised another policy approach , says he has &apos; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &apos; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and given him more than 30.000 inspiration .
the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ gest@@ unde is too confron@@ t@@ ational , and that he will refrain from both &quot; impact &quot; and the dispute with bar@@ bs , and instead decided to focus on serious issues such as poverty , ine@@ quality and challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , who will represent the Shadow Economy Minister , if he does not participate , for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also brought the idea into a conversation that other colleagues may occasionally take the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the spokesperson of the Lower House , to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; unch and Jud@@ y Theatre &quot; which is often linked to the Prime Minister &apos;s fragment . but a few years later he admitted that he failed .
as it was first broadcast in 1990 on television , the Prime Minister was regarded as the most important bar@@ ometer of a leader and his leadership in the basement and his position among his colleagues , although critics have argued that she has become a car@@ ic@@ ature and needs far @-@ reaching reforms .

Po@@ und rises through accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
the pound rose sharply to data indicating an increase in the United Kingdom &apos;s contract growth . parallel to this , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the aband@@ on@@ ment goal of SA@@ BM@@ iller .
between May and July , the result without bonuses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.@@ 9 % compared to the same period of the previous year .
this percentage has been the fastest and delivered appreciation since 2009 on the time of an interest increase .
the pound grew by more than 1 % compared to the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and climbed to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 , up to 0.@@ 84 % .
the FT@@ SE 100 index ended with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share on the market and made a jump of 20 % after tak@@ eover offer of the Ri@@ val AB In@@ Be@@ v .
a transaction would combine the world &apos;s two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies and bring brands like Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch together .
according to encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont , Bur@@ berry shares were 0.@@ 9 % higher .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts &apos;s latest sales figures hit all expectations and showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reported growth again .
shares of Gl@@ en@@ core rose by 5 % after the mining giant said that he had taken 2.5 billion $ by a share sale as part of his debt reduction strategy .
the stocks of the Packaging and Paper Group Mon@@ di were the biggest los@@ ers on the index , with a decline of 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set his assessment for the firm rating on &quot; sell . &quot;
J@@ D Sports rose by 3.1 % after the sports clothing company had reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the half @-@ year .
the head of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages are endanger@@ ing the expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate the higher labour costs in his company , he says .
the costs could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are less additional jobs .

PE@@ GI@@ DA poster brings Leban@@ ese to the idea of potato @-@ we@@ eter
potatoes or D@@ öner ?
these are both - in the potato @-@ we@@ eter , which the Oldenburg icon owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay has developed .
inspired by the saying &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ öner &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ hay potato and meat have been put together on a sk@@ ewer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea brought him a poster during a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ öner &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which he had seen on television by chance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , the shop has a barbecue with meat and potatoes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is multic@@ ult@@ i for the stomach , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Uwe Al@@ hay . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea of the Leban@@ ese was in the meantime to be registered at the German Patent Office in Munich .
according to the authority , it has recently been protected as a utility model .
this is why Al@@ hay is not willing to give away how much meat and how much potatoes the sk@@ ewer contains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes even better together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
culinary international understanding goes well with its customers .
met@@ a @-@ cash pi@@ vot@@ al campaign to combat Al@@ dian invasion
Met@@ cash tries to protect the I@@ GA branch from an Al@@ di rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a land stand campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run @-@ up to a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di is preparing the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia in early next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing through social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de Show .
I@@ GA dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands like ice maker S@@ immo from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA shops and sells shop owners who sell dis@@ approved tickets for the South Australian football league to loyal customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is expected that Met@@ cash will publish more details of its defence strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler of food , alcohol and equipment carries out its annual investors strategy ag . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is much at stake , as South Australia and Western Australia accounts for nearly 30 percent of met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA retail stores and generate higher profit margins than Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the eastern states .
buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ously provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in the eastern states .
analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will take around five percent of the food market in these two countries twelve months after the opening of its first markets and will take away all existing players , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published this week , analysts Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retailers could lose 360 $ million turnover per year and met@@ to $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA in the next year and will generate revenues of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in food and food business , and in the quantities on met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high , could cost about 13 million $ profit before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ cash withdraw@@ s market shares in the eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s revenue in the food and food business is 3.@@ 8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told in a business dinner in Melbourne that Met@@ cash was likely to disappear within a decade .
Met@@ cash refused to publicly respond to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash came into contact with Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
since 2010 IG@@ AS market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent , and revenues from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food and food trading , which roughly 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , have fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting operational debt reduction in simultaneous printing on sales and margins .
the wholes@@ aler , however , is reluc@@ tant to invest more than $ 150 million to balance sales prices with col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths at hundreds of products each week and to improve I@@ GA retailers in improving their stores due to faster growing fresh foods and to deliver a better choice of private label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s chief executive , Ian Mor@@ rice , says that the price adjustments and re@@ charging programs on El@@ an are growing and hopes that the wholes@@ aler will return to a profit growth for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise rather than criticism for his behaviour . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick , Kyr@@ gy@@ z , deserves praise as criticism for his own behaviour , according to the president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , which is repeatedly titled &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; became a spotlight with the not@@ orious confrontation of Kyr@@ gy@@ ms with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters .
soon afterwards Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent R@@ yan Har@@ rison had to be separated by the arbitr@@ ator in a fi@@ ery qualification game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati . Har@@ rison exc@@ laimed : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka should have had Kyr@@ gy@@ z , and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was last seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket after a cr@@ amp em@@ ailed a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was def@@ en@@ tically defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in the zel behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against Great Britain .
&quot; one thing I am quite ri@@ cher about is the fact that , according to my opinion , Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn up a little into the argument , &quot; He@@ aly said .
he broke a ra@@ cket when he lost in the US Open because of a fight , but he is not the first player to break a ra@@ cket from fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even among the fairly pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him and I think he was treated a little too severely .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard and he adapts to the team and so on , he has never had a problem with other players , he is well in shape , he &apos;s a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its .
He@@ aly also made the decision not to take Kyr@@ gy@@ z &apos;s decision not to take into account the deciding decision on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right thing for all , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return to the team as a long @-@ term permanent part . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not all the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gy@@ ms &#93; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think that Nick has quickly made the climb what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray pointed out , and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we are trying to make him understand the consequences of his action . I think it &apos;s appropriate for the team and it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s the best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary states emergency stand , closes the border , with@@ stands refugees
Hungary announced the emergency and negotiated the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all the hard attempts to illeg@@ ally come to the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed the border when hundreds of migrants arrested in a No Man &apos;s land and re@@ acted to Ser@@ b officials with indign@@ ation .
the people who had fled from violence caught up for an unknown time in a strip of land on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled down there .
but fru@@ strations were rising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when a police helicopter ho@@ ver@@ ed over them , the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and cried accus@@ ations against the Hungarian police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some expelled from protest food and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s foreign minister said it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary were sent back while more and more arriving from Macedonia and Greece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral damage .
talks with Brussels and other countries must take place in the coming days , &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague .
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border arrived a day after the 28 @-@ Nations @-@ bloc at a str@@ it@@ ent meeting in Brussels did not agree on a common immigration policy .
the ministers , however , agreed to divide the responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in the corrupted Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that the next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be reached that the EU states would receive further 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on Tuesday a special summit of the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Hungary did not put its hopes on a spe@@ edy action from Brussels or from its neighbors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the emergency in two southern regions on Tuesday gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis , so that they could block roads and speed up asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plans to build a bar@@ bed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country after having completed a fence along the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison occup@@ ants were deployed during the race to create the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East and became the entry point for the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insist@@ ed that most of the coming economic refugees are looking for a better life , and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws which entered into force at midnight in Hungary make the crossing of the border or damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 foot ) high fence , which the government built along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also establish higher sentences for convic@@ ted traffi@@ ckers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation arising from mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the state of emergency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said government spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs re@@ porters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
Parliament must still agree to the deployment of the military , expected next week , but re@@ porters from Associ@@ ated Press have seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for days .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , Land @-@ Security Ad@@ visor for Or@@ ban , said that authorities knew 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others had already gotten deeper into the country .
they come across by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of the perpet@@ ration of criminal off@@ ences in accordance with the new laws .
authorities are here to quickly repair the fence .
Hungarian officials closed on Tuesday morning also two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia , after a train wag@@ gon with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
chaos killed the most important border crossing close to Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and press a crowd to squee@@ ze themselves there .
about 20 succeeded in entering , but thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants blocked the main highway connection between Serbia and Hungary , saying that they would refuse food and water until they travel to Hungary .
election 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national pol@@ l hal@@ ved
H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s former Secretary of State remains a double @-@ digit advantage in the democratic race for nom@@ in@@ ee at national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her face to ground .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in pre @-@ elections ( 58 percent before ) while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
vice @-@ President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is candidates for the presidential office , receives support of 15 percent of the democratic voters of the primary elections .
more than five months before the first elections , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is determining which candidate they will support .
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their election than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS News survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups while S@@ anders earned some profits .
Clinton has a great lead in women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have less@@ ened .
her support with the men has s@@ unk dramatically , and S@@ anders is only back with 5 points .
Clinton &apos;s advantage in democratic elec@@ tors under 50 years has evapor@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level .
Clinton , however , has a great advantage over older voters .
last month Clinton was ahead of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit advantage over the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has now a 5 @-@ point lead in this group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about half of the Democratic constitu@@ encies of the local elections say that they would support Clinton if it was nominated by the party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one neighborhood would support them with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support them because they are the candidate .
they would not support six percent .
perhaps not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are particularly enthusiastic about her .
the views are more mixed with those who are not currently supporting Clinton , only about one quarter would support them enthusias@@ tically .
while 48 percent of the democratic elec@@ tors of the prim@@ aries say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republi@@ can voters say this about their top candidate Donald Tru@@ mp ( 35 percent ) .
if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want them to be the candidate is the most common answer that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the opinion that it &apos;s time that a woman president is ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s supporters also mention her connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consent to deal with the problems and the vulner@@ ability are also cited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Vice @-@ President thro@@ ws a potential for the presidential office in the scales , 57 percent of the Democratic constitu@@ ents of the pre @-@ elections would like to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not do it .
if democratic elec@@ tors of the primary elections are asked who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the head .
more than half of Clinton &apos;s supporters say that Bi@@ den was her second choice far from S@@ anders .
if Bi@@ den decides not to run for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s head start to S@@ anders , from 20 points with Bi@@ den in race to 30 points without him in the race .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fifty @-@ five percent of the democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the election ; however , this figure has fallen from 78 percent last month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that regards it as the &quot; selectable &quot; has increased .
nevertheless , in the question of what is more important with a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about the elec@@ torate .
similar to the last month , not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for that vot@@ er of the prim@@ aries is unacceptable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the democr@@ ats candidates or potential candidates provide good results with some important tra@@ its in voters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prim@@ aries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of their party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
maj@@ orities view Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
Bi@@ den is best suited to the three candidates with hon@@ esty , while Clinton &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty per cent of the democratic voters do not believe Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion of it .
in general , democratic elec@@ tors of the primary elections also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
in all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic elec@@ tors have no opinion of S@@ anders .
as questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server continue to be put forward as foreign minister during the term of office , most of the Democratic constitu@@ ents of the primary elections are happy with their explanation of the matter and say that their opinions were not influenced by a whole .
but it is another story in the American public altogether .
half of the Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about one @-@ third is satisfied .
public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the email controversy had no impact on their general opinion of Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion had wor@@ sen@@ ed of it .
they are mostly Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , more than six out of 10 who say that their views of Clinton have become worse .
although Clinton is considered honest and trust@@ worthy by the voters of her party , this continues to be a problem for her among registered voters . only 32 percent see it as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of those entitled to vote do not hold them for an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 percent of voters across the country see Tru@@ mp as not honest and not trust@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tru@@ mp , however , get good marks with leadership .
from the six candidates tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush cut best in hon@@ esty .
a majority regards S@@ anders rather than hon@@ estly , but as with Car@@ son many have no opinion of him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 democr@@ ats in the pres@@ election is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son advances in nationwide survey near Donald Tru@@ mp
Ben Car@@ son is in the latest C@@ BS News / New York Times survey , close behind Donald Tru@@ mp
the two Candi@@ dates now account for half of the vote &apos;s support in the new pol@@ l , and others are losing dramatically .
Republi@@ can voters continue to support Tru@@ mp in large numbers throughout the country . the support grows from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted prior to Fox News debate last month , 27 % in the survey from Tuesday .
but Car@@ son suffered from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son is well received by demographic groups and that tru@@ mp is sur@@ passed among Republi@@ can elec@@ tors with university education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ ze , is defeated with Wis@@ cons@@ ins Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who has fallen on the lowest , from 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
former Gover@@ nor J@@ eb Bush , former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio are in third place at 6 % .
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 people from Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6 % and was carried out in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey released last week shows that Car@@ son is rising in surveys - he lands with 19 % support from the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , behind the Tru@@ mp with 32 % support .
the latest survey by ABC News / Washington Post was also showing Tru@@ mp well ahead of Car@@ son .
looking at a Car@@ son rising in the last week , Tru@@ mp found some si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question tru@@ mp faith .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp last Saturday during a campaign show in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
even if peak values are measured only in the distance , for bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers there is already a trip to the Mediterranean to find even warm water .
a bath in the North or Baltic Sea is likely to be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people are no longer going to the sea : at a maximum of 18 degrees the water in the North and Baltic Sea in this week , the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) shares with them .
bathing temperatures , on the other hand , continue to offer the Mediterranean Sea : in the east it is even up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic Sea , it is 25 degrees in the top , 23 degrees in France .
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood exer@@ ted on the death of a Bar@@ uch college new@@ bie
almost two years after a student died during a schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic ritual of a student union in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder charges are filed against five people .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g in September 2013 brut@@ ally and delayed his transportation to the hospital , which contributed to his death , the police shared .
officials said he had been loaded with blin@@ d@@ folded eyes with a 30 @-@ pound ruck@@ sack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to go over a frozen field to a target .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained about head@@ aches , then he fell unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood didn &apos;t call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was f@@ ain@@ ted and claimed one hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothes , to goo@@ gle his symptoms and contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood to seek advice , police Chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , the members began to hide utensils and generally set the benefit of the Brotherhood on that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Police Chief Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could not be revi@@ ved , and the next morning he died of his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeatedly joined with bl@@ unt force injuries to head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh@@ s .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the har@@ ass@@ ment of the Brotherhood . at least one student joined the ch@@ ic@@ anes every year since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer who represents D@@ eng@@ i &apos;s family , in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be held ac@@ coun@@ table and this step by authorities is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe recommended an indictment for the murder of the third rank for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of criminal attacks and formation of a criminal association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t just want to make the involved persons responsible , but if there is an organization that sanc@@ tioned , officially or in@@ officially , we will also take this to account , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national bro@@ therhood has withdrawn its affili@@ ation to the local group .
this will happen when the F@@ ed increases interest rates
interest income is coming , and the land@@ se is falling , returns for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession .
we know this .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will take and how long it will stop .
in particular , the history of the economy offers little guidance on how to proceed .
a recession came within just 11 months after the first rate of interest rate and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , although not always , a factor in how the economy and the financial systems react .
therefore representatives of the US central bank strongly emphas@@ ised that investors should not focus on when it starts to increase interest rates , but rather on the time needed for normal@@ isation .
in fact , several variables play a role .
in the end , however , market participants could find that all the excitement was possibly exagger@@ ated due to a raise of interest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase of the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Julian Je@@ ep , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to the sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
this does not mean , however , that there will be no effect .
here is a view based on historical trends , how some areas of the economy could react :
as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases can make things volati@@ le for a while .
as soon as the increase arrives , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; there seems to be a tendency that capital gains will be reduced from 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happened after interest rate increases in the F@@ ed .
more precisely , the market is usually upward trend in the past 35 years - about 14 percent - on the road to interest rate increase , rather flat in the 250 days after ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal condition after 500 days , with an average rate of return in the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent , according to a current analysis published by Bob D@@ oll , head plant strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
Deutsche Bank said that the effects on stocks tend to occur later in the development cycle and the rate of return begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases they often promote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is faced with some conditions that did not exist before and which could accelerate a recession . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is extremely not@@ e@@ worthy that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point at a rate increase of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , at the 118 interest rate increases since 1950 only twice the nominal GDP was below 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , few expect this to pers@@ ist and expect only 1.5 percent of Atlanta F@@ ed in the third quarter .
interest increases in such a fragile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and raise the question : &quot; whether it &apos;s different this time , &quot; said the Deutsche Bank .
market participants all year round set for a net interest rate of F@@ ed , and all eyes were directed to the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week which ends on Thursday .
while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC could increase in this meeting , fut@@ ures trading is only a probability of 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all increase cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and on rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ists very quickly put in the shadows after the start of recovery , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest that the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months .
the fixed income was also volati@@ le , as the market anticip@@ ates interest rate increase , and the pattern is fairly similar to that of the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than stocks if they change their strategic course .
for bonds the yields seem to change direction once the first increase / decrease occurs in the cycle .
at the end of the development cycle , the loans dropped immediately , said the Deutsche Bank .
the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the rise in interest rates will cause returns between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
high @-@ interest bonds often yield better earnings in such a climate , although &quot; we are still cau@@ tious to expect higher returns , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fix@@ ed @-@ In@@ come Analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis .
Jones ar@@ gues that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides the strength of the dollar and the drop in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , credit tigh@@ tening has wi@@ dened and volati@@ lity has increased - all the features of the market when the F@@ ed ag@@ grav@@ ates its strategy .
in the large and whole , companies that handle the larger part of their business operations in the US will benefit when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
multinational companies with high debt are getting worse , as an increasing dollar is making their products more expensive on the global market , as well as financing their debts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; history shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stocks tend to react very positively three months after initial interest rate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s @-@ Analy@@ st in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet sur@@ passed 5 percentage points on average after each of the 1994 , 1999 and 2004 interest rate increases .
companies with high capital yields and low volati@@ lity with their shares also exceeded their low @-@ quality counter@@ parts by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts become a big problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; companies with a high proportion of flexible interest will lose most , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar outside of pure stock exchanges .
savers want to see profits due to higher yields , even if experts in different opinions are , how quickly that will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says MP Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ ative member of the Parliament critic@@ ised the broad@@ ca@@ ster because of his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stup@@ idity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not distingu@@ ish@@ able from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also participated at the BBC Music Awards and said that they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
&quot; &quot; &quot; Parliament @-@ colleague Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins attacked The Voice and said that this was not very original . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BBC Radio 3 &quot; turns &quot; into Classic FM , asser@@ ts a leading member of the Parliament and raises new pressure to the station to prove that he does something that the private transm@@ it@@ ters do not do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the conserv@@ atives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Andrew B@@ ingham &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also said the BBC bos@@ ses that the public @-@ legal radio station &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dum@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer be distinguished from its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dum@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn into Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also participated at the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be The Br@@ its just under another name .
so if you are trying to do something else - these are two spontaneously named examples where you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said .
BBC Director General dismissed the alleg@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is well ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and educ@@ ating the public .
what I &apos;m learning from Radio 3 , I will never learn anything else about classical music .
and there is a commitment to live music and music , which is truly unbe@@ atable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and order new works , I really think it &apos;s important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that harder it would be to engage the audience than it did in the past , because the British are less informed about classical music .
however , radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production , which came under fire during the hearing in the Committee on the Choice of Culture , Media and Sports to step up the commercial ri@@ vals .
the T@@ ory member Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins attacked The Voice , the musical talent show of the BBC , which was purchased by the Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insist@@ ed that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as judge - was produced &quot; in special BBC mode . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added , he wishes that the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; when the next time there is a series of entertainment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to exclude the order from further series of The Voice in the future , or to give money to the fees for other entertainment formats .
Internet sales increased in August at slow@@ est and Black Friday can be responsible
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month , there was the lowest result since the beginning of records in 2000 .
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that Black Friday has slow@@ ed down the issue in November
for over a decade , the virtual shopping has bo@@ oted , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into gh@@ ost towns .
but experts say that there is now signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new numbers only show seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
total expenditure for August presented the lowest rise in growth since the beginning of records in 2000 , with only five percent rise in comparison with the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new numbers only show seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , it has evolved over time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , publisher of the IM@@ R@@ G sales index to the Guardian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers started making purchases with their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do so in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now this is comm@@ uting , and we will possibly see that growth dimin@@ ishes .
the Black Friday phenomenon , imported from America , is cited as a reason for the subsequent sales .
experts believe that purch@@ as@@ ers hold their purchases back to this event , which takes place on the last Friday of November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers popping up around their computers to make their bar@@ gains and some dealer websites crashed .
experts believe that Black Friday , where the buyer deals with bar@@ gains , can prevent buyers from making purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that a little over £ 1 was spent more than £ 1 online out of £ 5 .
in some products such as TV and washing machines , more than one @-@ third of purchases are now being carried out via web shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of in the fashion stores in the inner cities .
Muslims fry the killed in Mec@@ ca by crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims at first burial in Mec@@ ca by the streets
Saudi Arabia do@@ des the collapse in part of the huge Saudi bin Laden Group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane crashed .
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury the ones killed when a crane collap@@ sed at Mec@@ ca &apos;s big mos@@ que .
mour@@ ning filled , mostly dressed in white , the route to pay their respect when the first of the dead approached their last journey to the Al @-@ Renaissance cemetery .
the funeral procession passed by the Holy Place where only days before a building crane collap@@ sed through the mos@@ que &apos;s ceiling and then onto the bed@@ side .
the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for the funeral when the Saudi King passed a sanc@@ tion over the bin Laden &apos;s construction company because of the catastrophe , which also left 3@@ 94 injured .
the bodies of 29 persons who were killed when a crane collap@@ sed through the Great Central Mog@@ ul Mek@@ ka were carried through the streets .
among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage as the crane supported .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ ling in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officials have already noted that the p@@ add@@ ling to Mec@@ ca with thousands still going to the city will continue .
today King Sal@@ man , the bin Laden Group , said that the arm of the crane should not have stopped when he was not used .
an Arabic version of the decree published by the State Saudi Press Agency said that the Bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse .
the English @-@ language service of the news agency did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company is banned abroad .
at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man promised to reveal what caused the fall of the crane that crashed into an inner courtyard of the giant mos@@ que , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ ling , which takes place later this month .
the Bin Laden Group did not publish any statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for a comment .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also rebu@@ ked the group because of not current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surrounding Mek@@ ka &apos;s Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive building project managed by the Bin Laden Group .
the bin Laden family has been associated with the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades and assumes major construction projects .
the dec@@ eased leader of Al Q@@ aida , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was an apost@@ ate son , who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 &quot; s .
the crash of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the Kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is at least once in the life of every healthy Muslims .
officials said 158 people stay hospit@@ alized .
government representatives filed that 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) were to be paid to the relatives of the killed and the same amount of permanently injured .
other injured get half of this amount .
B &amp; Q Boss says that the time of cheap East European craftsmen is over
British increasingly employ arti@@ sans , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of skilled tra@@ des@@ men from Eastern Europe has risen
this leads to the opening of 200 further Scre@@ w@@ ren@@ in stores target@@ ing tra@@ des@@ people .
at the same time , King@@ fis@@ her will close 60 B &amp; Q selling points nationwide
by Rupert St@@ einer , City Chef @-@ Cor@@ respon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is said that Br@@ its lay down their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favor of the use of qualified Eastern European arti@@ sans who carry out work in their home .
if you can handle a hammer or a brush to paint walls , you seem to belong to a minority nowadays .
because the British increasingly employ tra@@ des@@ people to perform do @-@ it @-@ your@@ sel@@ fers in their homes , such as the head of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new managing director of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the building markets chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled tra@@ des@@ men from Eastern Europe that offer services at low prices has now been out@@ dated .
this is why King@@ fis@@ her plans to open 200 additional Scre@@ w@@ y shops , aimed at professional tra@@ des@@ people and to close 60 sales outlets from B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wanted to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten purchase decisions in store are hit by women .
at the moment , the men out@@ weigh the men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said it was necessary to face growing demographic trends that have more female single households that do more renov@@ ations than in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Mrs Lau@@ ry : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to shift this stronger towards a balance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in principle , half of our customers consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the top of a UK in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also re@@ structured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ Fis@@ her is almost the only company that staff@@ ed exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and CFO .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Mrs Lau@@ ry : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ Fis@@ her reported a decline in half @-@ year profit and sales after the group deb@@ ated the cost of closing the shops .
because of the trends , King@@ fis@@ her , who owns Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches .
officials of A@@ ich / D@@ ob for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
on Wednesday two function@@ aries from the Austrian volleyball vice @-@ runner A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and public procurement on Wednesday .
the defend@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them was also charged with abuse of authority .
he was acqu@@ itted of this accus@@ ation in May of the final judgment .
the current process was postpon@@ ed .
according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General , Robert Ri@@ ffel had a preliminary examination of the fact that between 2006 and 2011 , the defend@@ ants had mon@@ ies of the association &apos;s accounts , about which they were allowed to dispose in their functions for private purposes .
the damage he har@@ rows with around 400@@ ,000 euros .
the sports officials are also accused of financial failures .
this fact was divided by the head of the Sho@@ v@@ eller , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it shall be negotiated at a later date .
for the off@@ ence of the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence presented that at no time an asset was created .
the sports function@@ aries were only charged with expense indem@@ ni@@ ties and the sports club for which they had invested a lot of time and money from 1982 to 2011 - the Pas@@ si@@ va amounted to around 600@@ ,000 sh@@ ill@@ ings in 2001 ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 Euros ) .
&quot; back then we were confronted with the situation : do we carry on or shut down the club ? &quot; one of the defend@@ ants told , in the B@@ read profession , a major audi@@ tor of the financial official .
he then decided to take over this task with his colleagues and co @-@ defend@@ ants .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have advanced money , our life insurance is laid down as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said during the arrest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has been agreed with the association : you can freely manage the money , it is not allowed to make any debt .
furthermore , with corresponding financial success , the payment of the expense allowance had been decided retro@@ actively until 1991 .
therefore , one part of the expense allowance was paid only years later , namely from 2003 when an increase was on the account .
as a result , l@@ ump @-@ switches and not detailed illustrations appeared , the former Ob@@ man explained the processes .
accounts and accounts recei@@ v@@ ables the two defend@@ ants together , the second accused said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why the withdraw@@ als have not been disclosed in detail by the association , the judge asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association has not been interested in the details of financial support , it is important only debt bondage , so the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when investigations against official abuse began in 2011 against the one function@@ ary , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the association &apos;s account .
these had been set@@ backs , the defend@@ ants declared .
this securities account was filed under the name of the second defend@@ ant and , according to his statement , was not known to the association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the respon@@ dent did not know the answer for a long time .
then he finally said he believed that this was the best for the club .
if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything of that money , the prosec@@ utor introduced into the room .
the co @-@ defend@@ ant had been informed , the function@@ ary justified itself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this transfer was formulated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; claims for damage &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why compensation ? , wanted to know judge and prosec@@ utor .
the first defend@@ ant declared that he did not agree with this formulation , because the association had never suffered any damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; With this you are all of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
moreover , the function@@ ary said he never got a cent salary , he only comp@@ uted mil@@ eage and di@@ ets .
on di@@ ets , he charged the association € 1,000 per month , but the actual expenditure was much higher , he added .
the accused were not able to provide accurate documents for the early years .
these were no longer kept after an operating test , in which everything had been judged correctly , they declared .
the second defend@@ ant also referred to the mil@@ eage .
all shifts are in cash , and from his place of residence , he had to go to the Bank to Blei@@ burg from his hom@@ etown , he explained in his statement .
the main hearing is continued on 23 September with the survey of witnesses .
Hewlett @-@ Packard presents more 30,000 jobs
in addition to the staff cuts that have been running for three years , the computer terri@@ ese will reduce further jobs in the company &apos;s spl@@ itting up .
the sub@@ missions at the U.S. computer terri@@ ese Hewlett @-@ Packard ( HP ) do not end .
as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to cut down 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer segment .
as a result , costs tot@@ alling 2.7 billion dollars ( 2.4 billion euros ) are to be saved by the company on Tuesday .
the move will result in a special load of around $ 2.7 billion , which will fall from the fourth quarter .
the excav@@ ation of 55@@ ,000 jobs has not yet been completed .
at the end of fiscal 2013 / 14 , HP had approximately 30@@ 2,000 employees .
in the after@@ market , the Hewlett @-@ Packard share was 2.3 percent .
the Califor@@ nian Pal@@ o Alto grown with printers is currently spl@@ itting up : the computer and printer business is to be bund@@ led once again in a new society - separated from the more promising areas with computer servers and data stores for companies and other services .
both business parts are to be listed on the stock exchange .
a once again dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC sales and a weaker demand for corporate customers according to its services , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer ranked most recently .
in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July , the sales of PC and printers decreased by 11.@@ 5 percent .
sales fell by 8 percent to just under $ 25.@@ 4 billion .
as a result , sales declined in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP responds with spl@@ itting and massive sub@@ stan@@ cies on change in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has re@@ acted late to the fact that customers are increasingly buying smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers and always do more business online .
as a whole , Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans envis@@ age the disman@@ tling of some 55@@ ,000 jobs .
conflicts : majority supports anti @-@ IS training mission
a direct participation of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq , however , would mostly result in rejection : 54 percent spoke out against it , 35 percent agreed to agree .
the fact that other states are flying air@@ strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria are 61 percent positive .
24 per cent are opposed to intervene in the conflict .
in cooperation with the Syrian government , Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , 51 percent of those sur@@ vey@@ ed reject 20 percent of the respon@@ dents .
29 per cent was unable to decide .
car : second press day at the 6@@ 6th International Motor Show
the main focus of the fair is on networking , self @-@ prop@@ elled cars and electro@@ mobility by 27 September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after two press days , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th International Motor Show under the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mobility unites &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wide public can visit the International Motor Show from Saturday .
like two years ago , the organizers of the V@@ DA Association expect approximately 900 000 visitors .
R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violent erup@@ tion of Serbian @-@ Hungarian fron@@ tier
the Hungarian police deployed several hundred forced refugees on the Serbian border at R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke tear gas and thro@@ wer .
Euron@@ ews dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the breach of violence at the border check@@ point .
he reported by telephone :
a group of refugees broke the border .
behind that , a police line was formed and behind the polic@@ emen there was a laun@@ cher ready .
40 to 50 refugees began to throw stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials .
the officers at first sat down with continuous pepper spray .
after that the police used tear gas .
a lot of tear gas was spra@@ yed towards the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
the refugees have now withdrawn .
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was carried away from the zone .
children who had inhal@@ ed the tear gas cried out .
other refugees collap@@ sed and suffered from short@@ ness of breath .
the Serbian police press spokes@@ men also suffered injuries by the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US central bank
the world is watching when the US bank@@ note comes together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether the interest has been raised for the first time for almost a decade or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists questioned by Reu@@ ters found out that a little more than half , which was the last week of view that the F@@ ed will do this , now thinks that the F@@ ed will continue to pers@@ ist and keep interest rates at the current level of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent .
it is a historical event because it is seven years since the F@@ ed interest put interest on NU@@ LL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time , we approach a situation where a large central bank may exit the zero area and start a process of normal@@ ising interest rates , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Angel U@@ bi@@ des , Head of Associ@@ ate at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US economy is on a relatively good level of performance , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ros@@ y outlook on global relations .
it has warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs point out that the odds against such a move are good .
the decision is to be announced at 8 : 00 p.m. CE@@ T on Thursday
death Prot@@ ector at Delta State University left ap@@ ologies
after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he later shot his colleagues on the day - Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; at the first murder and wanted &quot; he could make it happen , &quot; announced authorities on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , lecturer of ge@@ ography and social science education at Delta State University , called the emergency telephone number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning
and he said , He has shot on a man , and he has killed any one .
Lamb told the employee of the emergency call centre that police must send polic@@ emen to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house but who will &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; distur@@ b anyone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but will probably be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the c@@ aller for his name , but he did not give him .
Lamb issued no explanation for his shots .
when police entered the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 , who said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted I could undo it .
I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman I ever loved . &quot;
after writing the note Lamb went 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally killed his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ p &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite reports on Monday , the Lamb allegedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss also had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday that there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was described by Sha@@ wn o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said that she was married about seven years as a &quot; good man . &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago but remained friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss would have a daughter who is 19 , and she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss were her daughter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog named Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; Know@@ les
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said that Lamb had inv@@ oked relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He is not going to jail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when polic@@ emen pick him up on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lamb passed his car to the side , fled to foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
Lamb received a doctoral title from the Delta State University in the spring of 2015 , as his life @-@ law gives on the University &apos;s website .
stars who have lost their luck charm
the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stress@@ ful years .

the actor allegedly tried to fight with drugs , and in 2008 he was convic@@ ted of drug possession .
all this safely calls for his tribute .
Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa is building the Group
Lufthansa is planning a large Group restructuring .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year alone with a better organization .
150 of the world &apos;s roughly 1000 managers will cost the workplace .
meanwhile , there are new negotiations with the pilot union .
the Lufthansa is expanding its corporate structure and utili@@ ses the low @-@ cost Euro@@ wings .
the goal of the real@@ ignment is a contribution to earnings of some EUR 500 million per year from cost and revenue syner@@ gies , the airline communicated on Wednesday .
among other things , Lufthansa is no longer in charge of the passenger &apos;s business .
the low @-@ cost airline Euro@@ wings should be developed as independent as possible .
in the future , Managing Director Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r will be responsible for Euro@@ wings by Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt .
in the future , Sp@@ oh@@ r emphas@@ ises the importance of Euro@@ wings , with which the Group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future .
until now , the organisation of the 120@@ ,000 employees was complex .
the airlines operated under the roof of the Passage Group group , accounting for three quarters of the annual turnover of EUR 30 billion .
new negotiations with the pilots
in the tari@@ ff conflict with the pilot en@@ vereinigung &quot; Cockpit &quot; ( VC ) , negotiations are scheduled to resume after the Stri@@ ke Stri@@ ke on that Thursday .
this divided the union .
the theme of the talks will be the retirement regulation for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a forec@@ asted rec@@ tor result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can come to sustainable results as soon as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between the union and airline carried out several strikes in recent months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the transitional provision of the pilots , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saving concept is in the background . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it seems that Lufthansa is lag@@ ging behind the Group &apos;s own cheap airline Euro@@ wings in the fight against competitors .

Manchester United , Luke Sha@@ w , can &apos;t play for months because of double frac@@ tures
Luke Sha@@ w suffered from Manchester &apos;s Champions League defeat at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven a double frac@@ ture of his right B@@ one .
while this brought the left Ou@@ ter Defender to tears and exclu@@ des him for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w can play again this season .
the injury was caused by a reck@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Sha@@ w died in the PS@@ V area .
he was treated nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before being taken to hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double leg structure and is hospit@@ alized . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be reloc@@ ating tomorrow or maybe one day later and then operating in Manchester .
it &apos;s horrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , has very hard and then plays fantastic , and then it happens .
in the locker room he had a oxygen mask .
he cried .
I am not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then the six months will last and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to have escaped a Red Card and the Sus@@ pension of an El@@ f@@ om .
Nic@@ ola R@@ iz@@ z@@ oli , the arbitr@@ ator , has not punished the Mexican .
van Ga@@ al pres@@ ump@@ ed that the Italian arbitr@@ ator had mistaken .
you can judge for yourself if I say that an El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
a tweet to Sha@@ ws account was : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery starts now , I am coming back stronger . &quot;
related : Manchester United inv@@ ests the loss of Luke Sha@@ w at the PS@@ V defeat
with the European Championship in France , the UK distributor has an additional incentive to recover until the coming of June .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Phil@@ lip Coc@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a player with this kind of injury leaves the place , everyone is very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ al &apos;s Dutch team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very hard because it wasn &apos;t his intention to hurt the opponent , and when you hear it &apos;s a very bad injury , it &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Coc@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball that was in a different direction , so it looked like he had touched him &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
talking to S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be .
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to the hospital - after a b@@ oul@@ line by Chris Sm@@ alling .
certainly David Cameron doesn &apos;t know The Lor@@ ax better ?
it is one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t take long before you almost know it by heart .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child care systems to call his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax decided to cover the environmental bill published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative , and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book I like to read to my children , because it seems to always be a picture or a message that we have missed so far . &quot;
everything nice and good except that the next paragraph , in which Cameron is supposed to describe the story of the book , instead re@@ stores a 2012 movie version that added new characters and details to extend the rather short original text .
&quot; in the midst of the walled city of the need @-@ Ville , where all nature is gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , &quot; one reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was The@@ odor Zei@@ ck Gei@@ sel and died in 1991 , but completely unknown .
as if that wasn &apos;t susp@@ icious enough : the text presented by Cameron is partially reading as the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie , which is presented on the Internet Movie Database website and thus begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he ad@@ mits to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so familiar with the story of the book . here , an un@@ named boy hears how the local environment is rav@@ aged by gre@@ edy , trees fal@@ tering , thin @-@ hear@@ ted entities , &quot; which speaks in the name of the trees . &quot;
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per , who did not read The Lor@@ ax a child 20 times in a row .
a Dow@@ ning Street Spe@@ aker said that the text was probably come from Cameron &apos;s El@@ ection Bureau .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s staff but gave no further immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened with the expul@@ sion of England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult
encounter@@ ing Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but when one sees the cad@@ re that England has chosen for the tour , there is no repetition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat on my map .
I would not exclude an out@@ ward victory .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks &apos;s site might be less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in the bat@@ ting , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear any sc@@ ars of 2012 , just a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude .
with the ball Mo@@ een Ali develops as a spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he is an unknown quantity at test level , is an option for the attack .
related news : Adam Ly@@ th leaves the England @-@ Test @-@ Ka@@ der and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to om@@ it Adam Ly@@ th is of course difficult to analyze for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire .
in his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are oriented to results .
there was no question mark at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said this before - players are their own best sel@@ ections .
long ago we would have extended the run of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own fate .
hopefully , if he will pick out more things for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance comes .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ li@@ ss praised his attitude , even if he did not get such good performances and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team man .
the question of how much time a test drummer gets to set his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick was nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play back and forth .
the only accus@@ ation that one can raise was that England first deployed Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he is a drummer , whom I set up high .
he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , which we saw in Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which hit us very much .
he must have at least the same opportunities as those before him , but this naturally depends on the deployment of men in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to create Mo@@ een along with Cook , which would bring an extra spin @-@ bow@@ ler and got four squ@@ e@@ aks , di@@ ved , and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and that left @-@ h@@ ander has already shown that he is a devil &apos;s l of cri@@ cket players .
mos@@ ques might have done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for them , and there is no big difference .
my former te@@ amm@@ ate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests on the first drop before he appeared as an op@@ ener in 2001 .
he got three hundred vines immediately and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes in the Ka@@ der as back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited use with him he impressed me very much as a young man .
people may see his stat@@ s - on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a p@@ unt but there are no big number of backup sp@@ inn@@ ers who raise their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England has made some clever additions to the trainer .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ den , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a masterpiece coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys of the game , who will bring a wealth of experience as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood arrives for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful commitment to the setup .
I always felt he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela , he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind in the changing rooms , even if the messages are in line with what has been said before .
Coll@@ i &apos;s team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , won &apos;t be used at the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it for my part .
some will not agree , but coaches and team performers do not determine the schedule .
and you need to remember that as with the players their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made with a light heart .

in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it when it je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zes social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie &apos;s agenda .
Prime Minister and finance ministers climb on summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say that they win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my European friend who wishes an outside @-@ looking UK within the EU @-@ tent - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s not alone with France , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Berlin - and lets see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials came to the point where they don &apos;t care whether we stay or go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious German chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her as long as T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mitter@@ rand ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) have taken place .
France &apos;s François Hollande can look back on his re @-@ election or his replacement in 2017 .
he is also a f@@ ading force .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a left one .
it is difficult to imagine that they will tear a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie Br@@ its whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they do not want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
therefore , some such ministers may even deliberately not plan any helpful ann@@ ot@@ ations , quite in SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign in 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process susp@@ ects my friend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ ego@@ ti@@ ation was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ lei@@ te &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Britain has won nothing of value from the ren@@ ego@@ ti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how we@@ aving St. Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense and what EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the pres@@ seb@@ ac@@ ons , as they did during the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Ben@@ n , who supported our 1973 entry with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
they can remember Boris Johnson , the ore @-@ euro conci@@ li@@ ator , who has made a name as an &quot; EU line ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s .
with all its ma@@ dness , Ed Mili@@ band knew who were his enemies .
this included the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing vil@@ la@@ ins , telephone @-@ h@@ ack@@ ers and the P@@ seu@@ do non @-@ countries that have most of our big newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought about her , but found that if you sit in a cage with a hot gor@@ illa , you &apos;d better distribute ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of going to his lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir himself than Bla@@ ir himself when he opposed Camer@@ ons &apos;s refer@@ endu@@ ms , for Bla@@ ir had rejected the principle of the un@@ approved constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened it a back@@ door .
the press has never forgiven him .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly tap on my back on Monday - I told him that he needed no more time for me - seems to be in danger of repe@@ ating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the eigh@@ ties , a mistake then and today .
it may take time but he must develop a coher@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ sofa he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position on Europe is - I express it friendly - in development .
he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps traditional blue @-@ blue @-@ off @-@ trend and the wild fel@@ lows of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engli@@ sh@@ ism can say Yes .
it &apos;s what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no B@@ enn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on radio and on television this week , when the boy@@ sc@@ outs fought in him , did not admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell as shadow chan@@ cell@@ or was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 &apos;s when his old father tried to be il@@ lo@@ y towards his Labour Cab@@ inet mates without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ary &apos;s struggle was even more attractive .
but to fight to &quot; stay under all circumstances - B@@ enn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his comrades and MPs after all reports on their Sunday evening cl@@ auses .
whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and especially in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding ground of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is right to give Cameron a free map for Europe allowing him to keep Lab@@ ours assistance in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks for sure .
but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities on EU membership - in line with their B@@ enn@@ ite Siege @-@ Economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion under left dissi@@ dents , for whom the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with its ambig@@ u@@ ities for Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find in all a sense for their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have di@@ stru@@ st@@ ful voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British , if all this can be sen@@ sel@@ ess ?
the US is already quite disappointed by the weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a lowering of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded of at the start on Monday of something that was called British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum .
experts critic@@ ise report from Public Health England on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people , some with links to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in her report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
he published the &quot; Basic Report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry .
an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; extra@@ ordinarily win@@ dy base &quot; on which P@@ he founded his most important conclusion .
two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked whether the claims &quot; build on stone or sand . &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on proving efficacy &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said that the public expects that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the present best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on a detailed review of the evidence and modelling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multiple criteria decision analysis ( multi @-@ C@@ riteri@@ a Decision Theory - MC@@ DA ) to lead their opinions on the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ based products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ised in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company named Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing directors had previously received funding from British American Tob@@ acco resources ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed BA@@ T &apos;s references to public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting agreed to receive funds from an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes manufacturer , but not the funding that he was supposed to have received according to reports from tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International , added them .
the reasons for choosing the members of the board are not supplied , but there are several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champi@@ ons , some of whom also provide industry funding in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
the meeting also took part in the Tob@@ acco management of P@@ he .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Group &apos;s research work &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; acknow@@ le@@ dges &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products with most criteria , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however none of these links or restrictions are discussed in the P@@ he report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that the alleg@@ ations of P@@ he that &quot; there is no evidence so far that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes served as a way of smoking for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers &quot; were premature .
pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , Director of Health and Well @-@ being at P@@ he , said that BM@@ J had already re@@ acted to the alleg@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life @-@ long his@@ sing dies in its ad@@ diction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects .
P@@ he has the obligation to inform the public about what evidence proves and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion over the relative risks compared to tobacco .
nearly 8@@ 0,000 people annually die from disease related to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds per year .
by clear evidence of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not at risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfill our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up on the East@@ side says former leader of Channel 4
the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ er- and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would &quot; give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broadcast fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK channels .
he critic@@ ised the BBC for making public @-@ law programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience to place in hard controversial time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and of sen@@ ders like BB@@ C@@ 4 .
after the BBC Director General , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said he tried to contact the BBC for six years at Channel 4 without success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programmes are commissioned or broad@@ cast@@ ed , which would also be clearly presented by un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus Communication Committee as part of his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to pay the broadcast fee , which I don &apos;t think of a good idea in the medium or long term , you should at least put your production on programs that others don &apos;t do or commission .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window , because they want to achieve the wid@@ est possible support for their future .
the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s course non@@ sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is funded , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ er- is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions .
to be honest , other channels would give their right arm to it .
I strive to see how this should be public @-@ law television .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC at all .
Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC &apos;s fault on the hunt for reviews is &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of the people who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on BBC &apos;s most popular broad@@ casts will be what the former director of Sky , Tony Ball , presented in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart teaching lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that BBC shows should be sold like East@@ enders .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ law N@@ ic programs should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , where you can &apos;t compete fairly the audience , but they can argue with their apparent missions for justification of $ 4 billion broadcasting fees , &quot; Well , of course , we &apos;ve created all these obsc@@ ure programs that nobody has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
to the broadcast fee , Johnson said to the Committee : &quot; I call on you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of who can get the best value from this .
of course , all of you think we all think that you get a great value for £ 150 a year , but for people who are a lot of money for £ 150 a lot , ask me if this is true , because they don &apos;t consume much from the BBC .
the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 chief David El@@ stein , who also testified before the Committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to review , &quot; educ@@ ate , train and enter@@ tain . &quot;
he said that only little from BBC production would now officially be classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and she was supposed to take an example of this change in &quot; inform@@ ing , clearing and talking . &quot;
on the question of partnerships , El@@ stein told the BBC to do more in areas like the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful in television will be shown , and with the commercial channels Alli@@ ances go down to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ Sizegenetics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the n@@ em@@ ato@@ des are changing the direction in the moment they are be@@ amed with sound impulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny n@@ em@@ ato@@ des alter the direction in which they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound impulses that have too high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
the impulses work by switching on motor neur@@ on cells , which are genetically modified to carry membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves .
more about this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ genetics , where ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , told the Guardian that one day the procedure could replace the low @-@ brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electrical impulses to the brain of people to treat symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
thread worms do not usually react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani found that they did when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scopic bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultr@@ asonic waves , which then penetrate into the worms .
the ampli@@ fied ultr@@ asonic waves act on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and can be found in the membranes of some of the worms .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , such as a report Nature Communications .
to create ultrasound @-@ controlled n@@ em@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the worms that some of their motor neur@@ ons carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
applying ultr@@ asonic to the changed creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro @-@ ves@@ icles and transferred to the worms , where they turn on the changed motor neur@@ ons .
the procedure has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground@@ breaking tool that enables scientists to turn neur@@ ons on and off with impulses of light .
but Hal@@ as@@ ani said that it could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light that needs to be sent down to the desired spot in the brain at an optical fiber , low frequency ultr@@ asonic waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the targeted human neur@@ ons temporarily suscep@@ tible to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani .
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important announcement : go from 15 to 18 September with the DL@@ R ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Dock@@ lands Light Railway ) you read in the font types of the London Under@@ ground and the hall@@ marks of the DL@@ R line , which turns into the image of a tank . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the 300 posters are designed by artists who have exhibited their work at the Museum of gru@@ es@@ ome designs in Bank@@ sys D@@ ism@@ aland .

&quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ C@@ CP @-@ creative director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that prevailed around advertising for the arms fair - by a Le@@ aders of the Ex@@ ce@@ L calendar - and thought : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a more real@@ istically oscill@@ ating corporate advertising , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it remains stronger by the blu@@ epr@@ int with bright colours and animation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture instruments at the trade fair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ nesty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we need now is a step in the British government and the guarantee that torture instruments are not tra@@ ded illeg@@ ally in front of our front door .
perhaps the most creative art around the arms fair comes from the area within Ex@@ ce@@ L , where exhibitors are f@@ ou@@ gh@@ ing fantastic eu@@ ph@@ em@@ istic products .

eight golden rules for life in student residence halls
eleven years ago , as a self @-@ for@@ get@@ ful 19 @-@ year @-@ old I moved into a student residence , still in the belief in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se s@@ miles of those I have anger@@ ed - and to the numerous , long @-@ lasting complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be di@@ sti@@ lled into eight simple rules .
the entrance into student residen@@ ces reaches from slightly annoying to absolutely frigh@@ tening .
it &apos;s temp@@ ting to talk : people tell where you are , whether and where you have taken Sab@@ bat@@ ax , where you &apos;re in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; hon@@ estly Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate because in ear@@ nest , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like in contrast to those with whom you would not speak , even if your eyel@@ ashes were burning and these fire extingu@@ ish@@ ers would be .
let people know .
people &apos;s rooms are often transformed into drinks reception , film night venues and municipal meeting places , but they are also the places where people dress and wear their under@@ wear .
referring to this : don &apos;t remember to start with a relationship at university
intro@@ ver@@ ted people receive a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student residen@@ ces form a room @-@ to @-@ space stroll culture that is friendly and social and can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone trying to recover .
nothing in the culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you and I want our friendship to go on , but you have to go away so that I get back the energy I used to interact with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow student is exhausted by con@@ vivi@@ ality - and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
speaking apro@@ pos : do it .
a guy in my student residen@@ ces had the idea that a not locked door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close by baking .
as you begin the university at the height of the back @-@ man@@ ia , the kno@@ ck on the doors of people to introduce yourself to a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es is less strange than the greeting of the 1950 @-@ s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I &apos;ve baked some of you . so , and now please smile when I ask you a few personal questions . &quot;
offering home @-@ made treats is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates will feel oblig@@ ated to talk and eventually will associate your face with a tasty surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
badly mixed lum@@ ps of flour , sugar and fat cause people to be sleeping when you kno@@ ck .
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student residen@@ ces .
of course , the ho@@ of of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea also ?
check this with the milk owner .
the chances are good that they say to operate themselves even if they cook inside .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying and you have my compassion - but try to deal with it as more balanced as my room@@ mate who added a r@@ ins@@ ing agent to her milk to punish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
they should not make any noise that stops people from sleep or work .
it is not only about being a decent person , but that in the tru@@ est sense of pro@@ verb@@ s you belong to the people sitting in the glass house .
a girl in my hall@@ way asked her neighbors , if it makes them something to make drum &amp; bass a bit qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning .
they responded with even more loud music .
when she finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly allowed her neighbours to sleep for two hours before she left her own music , closed her door and went to her three hour test .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse acci@@ dentally joined the same student residence ?
conver@@ sely , it wouldn &apos;t be too pro@@ found@@ ly embarrass@@ ing if you hold a room@@ mate for your future marriage partner , go to her to separate herself and then see her every day and perhaps experience how she moves all together into her friends ?
of course , the heart goes its own way - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future spouse , at least try to speak a bit of reason to your under@@ body .
in the exciting moment that you notice someone has left his keys in his not closed room , the border between an el@@ k and bul@@ lying is fin@@ er than it seems .
a good stroke is fun , but it only takes moments when it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
give by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson on safety - but don &apos;t miss someone &apos;s room with too@@ th@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
close your door and put your keys into a glass of water , which you then put into the freezer - but do not cr@@ ush their bel@@ ong@@ ings at the ceiling more than twice .
row houses for refugees , single @-@ person , Ger@@ ing@@ ver@@ dien@@ er
the property entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner builds in the Fran@@ con@@ ian Eck@@ ental Town@@ houses for people who do not have a lot of money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example , for refugees , but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need a living room , but also the mother and the poor servant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I show how to build even today still cheap and good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old interview in the interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees are forced to enter the housing market .
entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner relies on knowledge of how quickly affordable housing can be created : he builds in a project row houses for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Gil@@ dner , a lot of refugees will push for the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
which solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass housing in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for the people remain here for a great part .
in view of the refugee flow , we also need living space in the coming decades .
a very ban@@ al , three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution .
guil@@ dner : a Town@@ house needs least space .
it facilitates integration .
this is different if you put people in blocks of flats .
each of the six houses currently being built in the pilot project consists of three residential units for four asylum seek@@ ers .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it may be that many refugees will say it &apos;s peace again , I go back .
then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to their needs .
how much are the costs ?
dner : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 Euro , without land .
this is man@@ age@@ able .
the construction took six months .
this is appropriate .
do the building regulations prescri@@ be their plans ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guil@@ dner : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have made my project correctly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
particularly complic@@ at@@ edly , it always makes the im@@ min@@ ent D@@ amo@@ del value special construction and the Pit@@ ch Ord@@ in@@ ance .
cre@@ ep@@ y .
it is still under@@ lined who manages three flats in a row house , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities the place is missing .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers do not have cars .
how did the residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guil@@ dner : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were some who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seek@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
which definitely does not vote .
but do you not ag@@ grav@@ ate the competition for affordable housing ?
it is true that we had a building boom in Germany over the last five years , but we have built luxury apartments that can hardly afford any more .
my project has the message , even the normal people need living space .
not only refugees but also the mother or the ear@@ ring servant .
I show how to build even today still cheap and good .
that &apos;s what it is all about .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the setup app , type &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is ready , the phone will give you the option to download and then install .
some have encountered problems after installation , as they get an error message indicating that the &quot; software update failed . &quot;
to b@@ ypass the problem , users are advised to either wait until the rush is going back or trying to update via iTunes .
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
that may mean clearing Apps to create space - but Apple has made it more impro@@ b@@ able by stream@@ lining the updates . similarly , it will be easier to do this if you use a special tool to delete apps and then re @-@ install them as soon as the process is complete .
it is worthwhile to ensure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger , so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to be continued , as the phone might switch off half way and lead to a demoli@@ tion of the update .

Ros@@ berg &apos;s only motto : full attacks
in the fight for the championship title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes team @-@ mate , N@@ ico Ros@@ berg only knows a motto : &quot; full attacks . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; before the start of the decisive seven overseas races , the World Cup second stressed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have nothing to lose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
53 points separate the runner @-@ up champion before reti@@ ring in Singapore this Sunday from defending champion and double champion Hamilton .
the Brit@@ on already won seven of the twelve season races so far and will also attack the floo@@ d@@ light Grand Prix in the city state as a favorite .
in 2009 and last year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Brit@@ on won the race .
whether the current smo@@ g in the city state will have an influence on the Grand Prix of Singapore is still unclear .
for days , a ha@@ ze @-@ bell hangs over the city , triggered by fires on the neighboring island of Sum@@ atra .

Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ büro seeks direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the Alten@@ zentrum Anton@@ isti@@ ft have joined the social foundation under the clo@@ ak of the social foundation and opened a new stop at the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg Square .
in addition to consultations you can participate in courses there .
the social foundation moves it down from the mountain to the inner city .
more precisely , to the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office was recently opened there .
here , immediately next to the shopping market , sen@@ iors and advice @-@ seek@@ ers receive information on questions such as nursing insurance or benefits of health and care insur@@ ers .
for years , with our out@@ patient nursing service , we find that care@@ gi@@ vers are often left alone .
there are so many questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new land@@ lady Jutta W@@ eig@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ isti@@ ft and the Bürger@@ sp@@ ital as well as for the out@@ patient service &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained not rarely many benefits of the insurance companies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the new land@@ lady Jutta W@@ eig@@ and , which is responsible for the Anton@@ isti@@ ft and the Bürger@@ sp@@ ital as well as for the out@@ patient service &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
for this the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
therefore , additional offers such as prevention , memory training or physi@@ otherapy treatment can be used .
the offers from the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other perfectly .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; explains Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis .
the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre sees both women leaders especially in demographic change .
this makes a good de@@ centralized infrastructure in the individual districts of Bamberg in the future essential .
in addition , mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inauguration celebrations , the district office also dedic@@ ates itself to the compatibility at the age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the agenda and these invite you to a regular soci@@ alizing get @-@ together . &quot;
this enables the social foundation to make a big contribution that sen@@ iors can live as independently and well in their familiar environment .
the Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ büro is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tu@@ es@@ days and Thurs@@ days from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and on Saturdays from 10 a.m. to noon .

according to his own statement , he wants 30 kilograms of muscle mass in the past two years .
intellec@@ tually , however , he has not appe@@ aled .
meadow could just cut his hair in the Bre@@ mer city centre when he saw a parking space guard left a ticket for his white Chev@@ ro@@ let Cam@@ aro .
Wiese was stor@@ med out of the business , insul@@ ted the cler@@ ks , and threw her before the feet , as the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper reports .
in the city of Bremen , one confirms the alleg@@ ations , but is not yet clear about the consequences for the unusual incident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the thing is still in the test , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the city of Bremen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only after that decision will be decided whether meadow will be displayed or not .

men spray on 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
the police are looking for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ verb@@ ster : on Friday evening , around 23.@@ 45 hrs , three young men were on the way from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
one from the group , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ an , followed by the police with his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at this point the group was at the height of the petrol station .
there were also three persons on the gas station grounds .
one of these men now scre@@ amed the young boy and hit him face with the fist .
the victim suffered a rup@@ ture of the nose and bleeding heavily from the nose .
when his two friends ha@@ st@@ ened and appe@@ aled to the ra@@ cket , he first left his victim .
the injured young man was brought home from his friends .
the perpetr@@ ator followed the group with a passenger car up to their home and passed over there demonstr@@ atively several times .
when you no longer saw the vehicle , the wounded left the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was attacked again by the ra@@ cket and another male person .
with the help of a stroke it was checked on the face and the lower leg of the victim .
the injured had to be hospit@@ alized for medical care .
up to now there is only a vag@@ ue day description .
one of the men was about 1,80 meters in size .
the second ra@@ cket was about 1.@@ 65 meters tall and was dressed with jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt .
the police asks witnesses and exec@@ ut@@ ors to register under the telephone number 0@@ 6@@ 181 / 100 @-@ 123 .
Dr. Frank Müller takes over practical breaks and is investing 3@@ 10@@ 000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ zi@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ stand@@ ausen .
also vice mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , econom@@ ist U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also happy about this .
in many places in the countryside doctors are missing - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , has luck : Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice on October 1st .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ stand@@ ausen goes into retirement , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still standing at half a position in the next few months .
after a reconstruction phase Müller will open the practice on October 12 , until then he will invest 3@@ 10@@ 000 euros in the premises at St. Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 .
it was sympathy at first sight when Frank Müller and his wife met Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ g@@ l , who is currently completing her training at the Ver@@ den Hospital and who wants to enter into practice this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the rub@@ b@@ ish would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ stand@@ ausen and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was ready , I simply inv@@ oked it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea was liked by the couple Müller to practice their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to meet and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage , he also sees to be his own boss .
and so one agreed that the rub@@ b@@ ish bought the house with practice .
meanwhile , they will continue to live in sh@@ ausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the two @-@ time father Frank Mu@@ eller grew up there , followed his medical studies at Hanover in several medical practices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently working as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen . he has also been appointed as a senior physician in Di@@ ep@@ holz in 2009 and is committed voluntarily in the DRC &apos;s prepar@@ atory work in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
as of September 19 , the practice for the new boss will be prepared .
during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ stand@@ ausen , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Inter@@ ni@@ tin ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the Müll@@ ers , both Inter@@ ni@@ sten , want to settle as general practitioners .
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy therefore comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ zi@@ l .
after the conversion , the rooms will look modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and stress EC@@ Gs and need a talk room more .
in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
the Müll@@ ers receive a total of 50,000 euros as part of a subsi@@ dy programme from the county ( 25@@ 000 Euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy we are , that the practice is continued , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasized Sam@@ ba mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ dar , about 2000 patients come to the practice of Fel@@ stand@@ offs in each quarter each quarter , in the North German average practice there are about 500 .
there is another doctor &apos;s practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
a positive side @-@ effect of the practical tak@@ eover by Frank Müller : according to Ur@@ sel , the pharmacy remains in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
if no successor has found himself , she would have gone too .
who visits Müll@@ ers &apos;s consultation hour , inci@@ dentally , continues to look especially in familiar faces : takes over the seven medical staff and the cleaning power of the ri@@ ms .
with their farewell in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era ends , after all , the doctors practi@@ sed there for 30 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reminds Ur@@ sel Fel@@ stand@@ ausen chu@@ ck@@ ling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she already felt a little melanch@@ oly after the long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we continue to live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will see many patients quite often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Inter@@ ni@@ tin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband compl@@ ains : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6000 square meter property . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I have always pushed for gardening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and likes to travel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we leave refugees by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now border controls are also lifted at our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister of the Interior , Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the controls on the Hungarian border remain in parallel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still , it is clear that anyone who wants to ask for asylum is also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of the people is in the foreground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is clear , however , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people need to know that we do not accept bor@@ der@@ less migration flows , also not over the Austrian @-@ Slovenian border . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it needs a controlled approach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia is considering &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Slovenia refuses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would also leave arriving refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany and could also er@@ ect cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
the Interior Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach did not see this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy surveillance of the border - especially in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already very controlled as the outer boundary of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the Minister stressed , Slovenia seeks to avoid its borders for refugees but not . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every member of the EU must fill out its obligations , otherwise the system will not work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees tried already in the night hours on Tuesday to arrive in eastern Croatia at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id to avoid registration .
the c@@ roati@@ an police could pick them up in the nearby corn fields .
according to local media , police vehicles always met with new refugees in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik .
it is mainly dealing with Syrians and Afghanistan , including numerous women and children .
ambul@@ ances and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days , his country reck@@ ons with some 4000 refugees , Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic .
moreover , buses from Pres@@ evo to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian Serbian border , which had previously brought immigrants to the Hungarian border , were diver@@ ted towards Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Belgrade government denied that it was it that people would instruc@@ t certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither we can , nor do we want to do so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the media reports , in the early morning a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id , in the course of the day further buses would be expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the in@@ mates were on their way all night at the Mac@@ ed@@ onian boar@@ der located about 500 kilometres away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that Hungary admitted , so the police told us that we should drive here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
thus it could indeed come to a somewhat further west situated route to the predicted postpon@@ ement of the former Balkans @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive border control opportunities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia &apos;s interior minister , Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic , had stressed earlier that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations in case of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he did not mention details , but he pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive opportunities for border control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you perform strict controls in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been a member of this since 2007 , the EU partners have consistently issued a good testimony to the country as regards the standard of border controls .
on the Serbian side there are still about 300 refugees stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to the reports of Belgrade , they spent the past night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings of Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed .
whether the remaining refugees now want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear .
the Serbian Minister of Interior N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic was trying to calm early on Wednesday at a local time in Hor@@ gos : he considers the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed , for premature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would not be a very high number of refugees at this time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one could not say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugees have already begun to distribute maps on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia .
the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not safe : in parts of the border area there are still 20 years after the end of the Croatian war still not cleared min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a mine clearance team was sent to the border region .

in this way , a total of more than 100 million dollars were launched to the investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside of our borders are ultimately captured , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the SE@@ C communication . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went through the action right in the middle of the city and among the people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the director of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ hilfe ( E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ hilfe ) is also available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by for questions and talks like the voluntary workers .
while some pass@@ ant spontaneously grab@@ s the chal@@ k and affir@@ ms the sentence for &quot; my life be@@ affir@@ ming , &quot; &quot; Stop the war &quot; or &quot; stop suffering long , &quot; others stay short , read , say pro@@ positions such as &quot; I am not yet &quot; and then continue .
again and again , little discussions about the action itself develop on the ver@@ ge of life , dealing with death .
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on site .

therefore , this public @-@ effective action for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old is good .
the fact that not everyone wants to communicate openly , however , is understandable , after all , it is a very personal thing .

F@@ ed@@ Ex @-@ earnings shu@@ ff@@ led , financial outlook for 2016 lowered
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the supply giant lowered its profit view over a year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its body transport service .
the company also said that it plans to hire about 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for their holidays .
at this time last year F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to employ 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share fell by 2.5 percent in pre @-@ market trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a profit of $ 10.@@ 40 and $ 10.@@ 90 in the financial year , which ends in May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous predic@@ tion .
analysts expected a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10,@@ 84 $ .
the lower prospect is , despite the price increases , which reach an average 4.@@ 9 percent and become effective on January 4 , and despite increased sur@@ charges for body transport of heavy and large packages , which will be raised from November .
the company said it still expects that the result will increase over the previous year due to cost reduction , higher earnings and due to growth in online trade .
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company provides &quot; solid yields if one considers the weaker as expected economic conditions , particularly in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
the plans for the holiday occupation were announced a day later than that of the Ri@@ val U@@ PS , who plans to hire 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 extra workforce , for example the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex used 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share stood at 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just behind the $ 2.@@ 44 per share , which predicted twelve analy@@ st by Z@@ acks Investment Research .
sales increased by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion $ .
six analy@@ st asked by Z@@ acks expected $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
F@@ ed@@ Ex has recorded a drop in international priority shipments over the past few years , which generated sales in its unit express shipping .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter , the sales of the body rose by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the Express unit recorded higher earnings due to higher prices , while the result sank due to higher labour costs in the freight business .
in the pre @-@ market trading , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares declined by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0.@@ 15 $ .
on Tuesday , they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
at its most expected meeting in the year , Federal Reserve strate@@ gi@@ sts spend two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it &apos;s time to raise the interest for the first time for almost a decade .
a wall painting of the United States is located at an end of the decorated , two @-@ storey meeting hall .
the map is a reminder that the chair@@ woman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should set the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a double order from the Congress : maxim@@ ising US occupation and prices here stable .
but since the great recession the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision too tight to predict them . it will be announced on Thursday that the US economy is ready to be compensated by unprecedented ac@@ tion@@ ism by the close to zero short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most of the data in the economy show that it is growing solid , the recent tur@@ mo@@ il in global financial markets may make the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives anxious to increase this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal loans - and be it only a quarter percentage point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously the labour market and inflation will be primarily the most important thing they observe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker@@ age firm Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not raise interest rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which sec@@ ures the financial market itself .
about half of econom@@ ists recently sur@@ vey@@ ed by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted interest income this week .
the financial markets , however , expect a shut@@ down of the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance of an increase .
this points to a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the rate unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts l@@ essen the strike by promising a further increase is far away .
on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage score jump@@ ed by 2@@ 28.@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16.@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that F@@ ed policy maintains the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ sky , Chief econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if she does , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would have to go very far in her explanation to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that a raise of interest would paci@@ fy the financial markets because they would eliminate uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed in good ways to raise the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tigh@@ tening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the United States .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be needed , an increase in the sentence was expected .
although the creation of jobs slow@@ ed in August , the improvement in the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate dropped to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and close to the level the F@@ ed sees as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly below the annual target of 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs it because of tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ d@@ son , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets all over the world gathered together at the end of last month , after China had de@@ valued its currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage Year fell by more than 16 % in May , when investors feared that slow@@ ing down the Chinese economy would th@@ rot@@ tle global growth .
the market has recovered somewhat this month , whereas the Dow is now almost 10 % below the top of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , market tur@@ mo@@ il influences the complex calculation when to increase interest rates .
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and news of the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred over the past few weeks , they would attract the re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former staff of the US central bank .
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least a month to get a better grip on the effects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what will be the impact on the US economy , and there is almost no reliable data describing developments in China , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the overall health of the world economy is not the primary concern of the F@@ ed , so it should not be involved technically in the decision @-@ making process .
but in effect , the F@@ ed has become the world &apos;s monetary authority .
the influence of the central bank has been enormous over the past few years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the mere reference to the former director , Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nar@@ row@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her monetary expansion spark@@ ed confusion around the globe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives can be expected to not only monitor developments elsewhere , but also consult other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their decision @-@ making is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more art than science , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for the asset management of the company En@@ vest@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial market movements that apparently are not tied to the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
varnish , voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , which is committed to raising interest , made reference in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia led the F@@ ed to reduce its benchmark interest by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite limited recognis@@ able impacts on growth in the US , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lack@@ ner said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one year later , the F@@ ed representatives rever@@ ted these cuts .
the F@@ ed was supposed to put aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis such as the launching of the market in 2008 , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on Sav@@ ing the Bank of England .
the recent tur@@ mo@@ il doesn &apos;t come near this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation where she is afraid of a raise of interest , because markets are upset , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is amended , I do not believe that it should advance .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Leben@@ sh@@ ilfe for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany these days .
to give you a warm welcome does not go without the commitment of countless volunteer hel@@ pers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
Petra and Klaus H@@ eine are among them .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she is still very fond of her 74 L@@ ences .
every Thursday she does it at the asylum seek@@ er home on the D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .
it helps refugees from Syria , Kurdist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German .
of course , this is quite different from teaching at the right school .
Brazil &apos;s pa@@ edi@@ atric society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian Pap@@ edi@@ atric organization SP@@ RS attempts to inform women in a shock@@ ing manner how important good nutrition is during breast@@ feeding . it does this with the presentation of images of babies who su@@ ck breasts , which are painted with representations of un@@ healthy food .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research suggests that higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adaptation that mothers should do .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from tum@@ ours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new sports hall Bern@@ rie@@ der Spor@@ thalle
the municipal council Bern@@ ried approved the building proposal for the 2.3 million euro expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof may become fl@@ atter for solar installation .
the planning for the longed @-@ for gymn@@ asi@@ um at the Ber@@ rie@@ der Sport@@ grounds is progres@@ sing step by step : in the recent meeting of the congregation , the revised construction application was unanim@@ ously approved without major discussions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; previously , the committee decided among other things to apply for a legislative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the applicable plan of development . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was permission for a special form in terms of roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof with a non @-@ mit@@ ory first and roof top &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should be erected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the planning is the planned use of the roof surface for solar systems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this brings together a wonderfully large south @-@ roof , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; again , the roof ascent , which for energy reasons - is different from the plan of construction - is to lie below ten degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan regarding the a@@ version had no &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - whereby the Bern@@ hardt Gemein@@ der@@ at tends to be more restric@@ tive in the case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , this is not a recurring project in the hall building : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gymn@@ asi@@ um at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the municipality and S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
some 2.3 million euros are calculated at the cost .
subsidies are expected from school and l@@ ati@@ tudes .
in the next step , the construction application for the 18 x 36 @-@ metre @-@ large hall will be submitted to the Council of the Council for testing .
clinic P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg is planned to be closed earlier than planned - namely in 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is appointed as the new Medical Director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station as well as the majority of the employees move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this shows the surprising schemes of the hospital GmbH of the county , who confirmed the author Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss .
however , a decision on this issue is made by the Supervisory Board , and the meeting will take place on Wednesday 23 September .
if the plans were to be implemented , nearly 50 employees would be employed at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the vast majority should move with Fischer and the wider inner station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are available .
employees who are not able to go to Sch@@ ong@@ au should be offered a job at Wei@@ l@@ heim , so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
the staff are informed of the plans .
the change is triggered by Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has become the Director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Clinic since the beginning of the year and is now moving to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fischer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came into play on the question who agreed to take over the lead from 1 October and to switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this is in each case a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a spread of the offer in the area of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; internal medicine &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases on the inside .
for the next two years , if the Supervisory Board agrees to agree , both houses will lead until then the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ enheim , which still has 35 beds , is to be defini@@ tively closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
so far , the administrative district has planned this for 2018 , when the currently ongoing rehabilitation at the Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital has been completed .
J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss , who is also chairman of the Supervisory Board , met rum@@ ors that the house , which is owned by the federal government , should be used as accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I close . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it goes on with the real estate , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß asser@@ ted that there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is currently a short @-@ term maintenance of the Car@@ itas and a daily psychiat@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fischer on the move to the Le@@ ch , which had been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house where fisher@@ man has been working as chief physician for more than 30 years has not given it .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer &apos;s colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was repeatedly threatened by closing in the last decades , det@@ ach@@ ments were closed , for example surgery and obst@@ et@@ rics .
the Hand@@ b@@ aller of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar Lion are requested this evening ( 20.@@ 15 p.m. ) at the Berg@@ ischen HC .
although the table leader of the Bundes@@ liga is the clear favourite in Wuppertal , there is no reason for arro@@ gan@@ ce .
last season , Bad@@ ener moved into a painful defeat at the Bh@@ c and got something to do there .
hunting accident with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been seriously injured during their ma@@ ize harvest on Tuesday afternoon .
during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a ma@@ ize field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) , several h@@ unters were in action , as the police announced .
after a donation of a donation , an 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were brought to hospital .
how exactly it could come to the accident was unclear at first .
the Krimin@@ al@@ poli@@ zei ( Criminal Inves@@ tigation Department ) was as@@ cer@@ tained .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Conf@@ lic@@ t by Viol@@ ence of Viol@@ ence
one susp@@ icious has led the police to the cor@@ p@@ se of the 16 @-@ year @-@ olds of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate since Saturday .
during the trial , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted that the young people were killed and their cor@@ p@@ ses dropped into a rock in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old girl from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate has fallen victim to a violent crime .
the young woman &apos;s body was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as prosec@@ ut@@ ors and police hur@@ ried on Wednesday .
a 20 @-@ year @-@ old attached to the Tuesday evening is considered to be susp@@ icious , who , according to indications , conf@@ essed the indication and led the investig@@ ators to the discovery site of the cor@@ p@@ se .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after having come home on the eve of a visit to an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
in the search for the young woman , the investig@@ ators first encountered personal bel@@ ong@@ ings of the victim .
in the case of surveys in the circle of friends and acquaintances , a crime of crime against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was finally found .
the presum@@ ed perpetr@@ ator led the police to a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen where the cor@@ p@@ se was found .
according to the authorities , the police arrested the police , killed the 16 @-@ year @-@ old and put the cor@@ p@@ ses into the canal .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was supposed to be brought to the port fun@@ nel on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put him dead weight .
the further investigations are intended to provide information about the close circumstances of the act .
refugees need accommodation : study warns against housing shortage
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees search for a paid stay .
pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing is facing a challenge .
the distribution of distribution in the German housing market has long since begun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the incoming refugees and job@@ seek@@ ers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market which is already over@@ loaded in many large cities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they compete with low @-@ income citizens over the last affordable housing .
in order to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built every year by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result is a study commissioned by the association deb@@ its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sozial@@ er Wohn@@ bau &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
by comparison : this year , 26@@ 0,000 units are completed in Germany .
thus , 14@@ 0,000 dwell@@ ings are missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seek@@ ers in an original accommodation facility .
many come across the apartment market and fall into the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers lived for rent last year .
however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the rising number of refugees .
the study also makes significant reductions in the housing policy of recent years .
Germany is moving a residential deficit , which gets bigger from year to year .
currently around 77@@ 0,000 residential units already lack@@ ed in the metrop@@ olitan areas , compl@@ ains Matthias Günther , author of the study .
many professionals therefore lived in large cities in need in WG @-@ rooms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; young adults stayed longer in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the vac@@ ancy on the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the large cities , the number of square meters per cap@@ ita in recent years has dropped again for the first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order to solve the problem , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social housing construction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alliance proposes a re@@ boot . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is to revi@@ ve new incentives for housing construction .
thus , the basic income tax could be wai@@ ved and the property tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed flats may be suspended .
in addition , according to Cl@@ an , attractive tax @-@ free depreci@@ ation opportunities are necessary .
the funding programme for refugee shel@@ ters from the Kf@@ W ( Landes@@ bank Kf@@ W ) is already well received in towns and municipalities .
a good week after the start , more than half of the available approximately 300 million euros have been retri@@ eved on Monday evening with 184 million euros .
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free access : Croatia and Slovenia direct corridor
there is practically no way to go through Hungary , as more and more refugees choose the way through Croatia .
Zagreb terminated the passage through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous nevertheless .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia via the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke to the Slovenian interior minister , and if necessary we will organise a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Croatian Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU @-@ country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the abolition of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to get to Western Europe from there .
500 people came across the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reported by the Croatian television broad@@ ca@@ ster RT@@ L .
Hungary sealed its border for refugees on the day before .
new laws that entered into force the same day also virtually obvi@@ ate the need for proper asylum procedures in Hungary .
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic explained : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they can travel through , and we are preparing for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
in the morning the Croatian police took up the first refugees on Serbia &apos;s border to the neighbouring country of Croatia .
according to most media reports from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came both by bus and by taxi to the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
immediately after arriving they would have tried to walk across the green border to Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ Ser@@ b border , the refugees do not push to border barriers .
for this the border strip involves other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 9@@ 0s .
mine clear@@ ers are supposed to quickly create a safe passage .
after Hungary , after the closure of the border hardly any more refugees arrive .
on Tuesday the police numbered 3@@ 66 challenged people .
shortly before the closing date on Monday it had been 9@@ 380 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new Hungarian laws indicate the overcoming and damaging of the border zone as a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
35 criminal proceedings were therefore initiated in the south @-@ Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
the convic@@ ted thre@@ aten prison sentences of up to five years and deportation from the country .
according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were accepted on Tuesday in the newly established &quot; transit zones &quot; - almost all of them - 93 - the most important transition of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
among the applicants are 13 families with small children as well as two older people .
on Wednesday morning 40 refugees would have stayed there .
in practice , however , no one has granted asylum in Hungary anymore .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secure third country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seek@@ ers are to be de@@ ported there .
just a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke workers began to clean up .
they collected the garbage that tens of thousands of people left at the road@@ side in the past weeks .
barrier lat@@ tices were disman@@ tled and one of the gri@@ ds in the Grenz@@ ach was rebuilt .
no one wanted to comment on the goal of this conversion .
after the closing of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria can only reach a few refugees .
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
but the 20,000 migrants were still in the country according to government figures .
around 1400 people in Salzburg are waiting for the on@@ ward journey to Germany .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning at the instruction of German authorities .
in Frei@@ las@@ sing , smaller groups of refugees arrived on foot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; mayor continued &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; str@@ anded &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; across the border &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Brück@@ en@@ fest on Sunday , we were busy with the clearing , when suddenly ten people were standing at the door of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says W@@ ern@@ st@@ eins mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to travel by train to Passa@@ u .
because Germany had no surprise on Sunday because of the refugee flow with Austria , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s end , &quot; Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ red the frames along with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border into the Nah@@ e Passa@@ u .
previously we had the unexpected guests first cr@@ un@@ ched , with snack and drinks .
we said right away , we bring them by car to Passa@@ u .
&quot; this was a matter of course for us , &quot; says Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N interview .
they were very grateful .
a man refused to give a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were very pleased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the str@@ anded mig@@ r@@ atory passengers climbed from an ICE train into a regional train in W@@ els in the direction of Passa@@ u on Sunday evening to find it after the short @-@ term pro@@ clamation that rail traffic was stopped to Germany , but to try to cross the border .
but the regional train was stopped at the border in W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein the border crossing is generally high in the course .
the Brück@@ en@@ fest association with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday soci@@ ably , day before a two @-@ brid@@ ged run sporty - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
Viktor Or@@ b@@ án has now sent other zil@@ lions to us is a logical outcome of a hypo@@ critical policy :
instead of supporting R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke &apos;s camp immediately in the establishment of structures that ensure humanity , our German Chancellor has publicly and publicly moved the position of the Hungarian government into the sphere of National Socialism .
the speakers of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with chao@@ tic conditions in the border regions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees will also have to notice that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promised land &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which she has invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great challenge to create decent conditions for protection seek@@ ers in the face of the ongoing refugee streams and the approaching winter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it will be an even greater one - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad looking for 35@@ ,000 winter@@ proof quarters
Konrad has filled all hands with the provision of refugees .
Christian Konrad is used to having his word weight .
the government used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen ban@@ ker to place quarters for the thousands of refugees .
Konrad has already got a grip on the chaos in the first inspection center of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no homeless more in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reported of his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the housing of the 20,000 refugees that came to Austria on Monday was also carried out without a big vor@@ tex , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad , and praised the organizational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master performance &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ministry of Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a crisis @-@ like situation .
in total , Konrad reck@@ ons with a demand of 85@@ ,000 si@@ c@@ als in the he@@ ur@@ est year .
in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 accommodations have to be found in the next few weeks - 20.000 are supposed to provide the countries , 15,000 of the Bund .
if there are more refugees , we can do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is not a barrel without ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already held talks with the state capitals .
they would have promised him to create quarters for the coming refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is good in Upper Austria , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ ator supports Konrad .
tomorrow it will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , clari@@ fying how the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the asylum @-@ ordin@@ ator also sets great expectations into the ORF Action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ps like us &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
private persons can easily offer accommodation on the platform .
in addition , one hopes for hotels that are empty in the winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; yesterday Konrad and Ma@@ ier critic@@ ised the standards for placing as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in times of emergency it could not be that lod@@ gings have to maintain a certain amount of the towel rail or the size of the sky@@ light .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a temporary period , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have to apply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Konrad , with his experience , substanti@@ ates that he is more successful in the case of the Interior Ministry during the accommodation .
I am an elderly gent@@ leman who doesn &apos;t say fal@@ seh@@ ood in the face without further ado .
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier do not inc@@ ur any costs in the Republic as they themselves explained .
they want to increase their number of employees on three to four .
so far the own search for districts has not been successful yet .
Konrad wanted to set up a container at the Steph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with the permission .
Linz demands a better division
for the time being no opening of urban spor@@ es and other buildings like Tips Arena and Design Center for the housing of refugees is planning the city of Linz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not necessary at the moment because it is possible to accommodate those affected without these measures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in case of an emergency , however , other locations are to be tested for their suitability .
the chief of the city is critici@@ zing the division of refugees within the federal state .
other districts also have to make their contribution here .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; boundaries are not regulated &quot;
in a longer telephone conversation with Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday accentu@@ ated the further procedure in the issue of refugees .
Seeh@@ of@@ er has assured me that the German borders are not sealed off .
the further journey of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
however , there are now the corresponding border controls .
there will be no more special trains with refugees to Germany for the time being .
however , the protective @-@ seek@@ ers would be brought to Germany by regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once again called for greater solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that Austria is again introducing controls at its borders is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the action of the Germans for P@@ ühr@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; the general refur@@ bish@@ ment of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neue Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Linz Industrial Line is officially completed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT Group S &amp; T has moved in , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is said to be le@@ ased to young , innovative companies from the technology sector .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT , smart heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; D leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could imagine investing in Star@@ tup companies of the new ship@@ yard and later also acquiring some of them .
from the very beginning , S &amp; T hopes to cooperate with the new neighbours - what Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises to expect : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
1.7 million euros were invested in the location by S &amp; T , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which belongs to a third of the city of Linz , Upper Austria and the Federal Government ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is le@@ ased by Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ Center .
30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square meters remaining in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ erin opened second shop in the arcade
the new shop focuses on fur@@ la hand@@ bags .
in fact , Jutta Br@@ eit wanted to get a dog .
this project had to boost the 49 year old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the do@@ ve market ar@@ cades : after all , she has now grown in form of a further business area .
in the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop , opposite the shop , in which it sells among other things bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothes from different manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around ladies hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are available from 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously , several weeks were reconstructed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have long wondered if I should open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Br@@ eit said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision was , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of a location where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the big room Linz to sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who own Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion interest has gotten far from her mother in the cra@@ dle .
I am most suitable when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so many women are caught up at the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag , the skilled woman can &apos;t answer with last security .
perhaps it is because a beautiful bag enhances every outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ maker from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pal@@ at@@ inate ancestors of Donald Tru@@ mp came from a place whose inhabitants are called investors .
this property also connects some with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tru@@ mp ( 69 ) is always good for an upright player .
whether he expresses himself x@@ en@@ opho@@ bic , journalists rebu@@ ke or reveal knowledge gaps in international crisis policy - the candidate for the U.S. President &apos;s Office sha@@ kes the election campaign vigor@@ ously .
and cuts off well .
this is also recorded in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire come from .
the New Yorker with the hair@@ cut is a term for many in the wine village on the wine road .
some in the 1200 @-@ inhabit@@ ant @-@ place is related to it over -@@ zig @-@ corners with it .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tru@@ mp , here in election campaign mode .
the city head Simone Wen@@ del filmed a movie about Tru@@ mp .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think they find it exciting , but are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter style , &quot; Simone Wen@@ del says .
the native K@@ all@@ stadt has filmed a fun documentary about the town and its famous children , including the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz .
tru@@ mp , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) too - so with the statement that he would surely be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
to the king of the hearts he did not bring it there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; although there is respect for the family &apos;s performance , but also the opinion that Tru@@ mp is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a little bit a big mouth &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Wen@@ del says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
coinci@@ dentally the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt around , was &quot; Die Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - in High German : the initi@@ ator , she says .
so Tru@@ mp comes from the village of the An@@ gi@@ ers .
the Tru@@ mp success story began in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and opened a pub for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
corner@@ stone of the Real Estate Group were the first real estate purchases in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free from tragedy : their desire to return to their homeland in the long run failed in the Bavarian state , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate was at that time .
he did not take up Tru@@ mp because he was once without permission , the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ inate History and People &apos;s Rights , Roland Paul , had declared the start of the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp is the grand@@ son of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this contrasts with the sometimes striking statements of the descendants .
he repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the US and demanded the construction of a boundary wall to frigh@@ ten illegal immigrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not so li@@ ke@@ able , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative tru@@ mp ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Grand@@ ma was a born tur@@ mp , the grand@@ pa was born Heinz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the win@@ eg@@ rower at retirement looks more distant to the American , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always so upset . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he believe that Tru@@ mp is coming ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he never took care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the guesthouse mist@@ ress Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ramm is mentioned like some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz during a visit ended something for the church organ , which was generally well anchored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine it by Donald , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be better if he did not win the election , for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if those who had Sa@@ gen at the time of his grandfather in the USA would have been like him , &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as President ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my president is not , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe without the president Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wend@@ els &apos;s film , for which the Tru@@ mp was inter@@ viewed for a long time , saw 12@@ ,000 c@@ res@@ cent singers , also in the USA the interest awak@@ ens .

seven &apos;s Sunrise dominates the reviews , despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership in the Today Show
Charles Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son ha@@ sten to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report the loss of the leadership of the liber@@ als , but there have been no major shifts in today &apos;s evaluations .
the breakfast show from N@@ ine was broadcast by the federal capital when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull got the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the sunrise , with the present@@ ers David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , was part of a one @-@ week series of international television broad@@ casts , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Canc@@ un .
this down@@ side of the distance seemed to play no role for Australian TV spectators as Sunrise achieved an average of 39@@ 7@@ ,000 spectators at the five major cities , in comparison with today 33@@ 9.@@ 000 .
today , Today , there was a slight increase in ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today , today , Today , the gap to sunrise has closed .
in August , Today , Today , Today , Today , Today was 3@@ 18@@ ,000 compared to the 33@@ 0,000 of Sunrise .
at the beginning of the year the gap was between 40,000 and 50,000 .
up to now in September , Sunrise is at an average of 34@@ 9.@@ 000 viewers at Today &apos;s 3@@ 14@@ ,000 spectators .
this is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .
the winds of change affect these morning min@@ ers more than the Parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thanks for the review !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ter Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently clou@@ ded father who decided to settle with his two children on New Zealand &apos;s coast reached a very impressive figure of 1.@@ 2@@ 19 million spectators .
critics had wondered if Thom@@ son could wear a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ting Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening responded with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X @-@ Factor of Seven stayed strong with 1.@@ 136 million spectators and stroke easily The Block ( 8@@ 38@@ ,000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) .

the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ ef@@ e yiel@@ ded an average of 44@@ 6,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jump@@ ed to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
mystery uncovered ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ an@@ on Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may unknow@@ ingly seem who wins the Bachelor &apos;s degree .
the woman , at which Sam Wood eventually lands in The Bachelor , was covered with great sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose .
but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows a day before out of three two , you may acci@@ dentally have a clu@@ e on who will be the winner .
Sam Wood keeps his lips sealed until the final on Thursday
all three women have been ly@@ rical about why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of hum@@ our , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who should receive W@@ oods last rose ? , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could become their answers to the game cor@@ rup@@ ting who won the heart of the Bachel@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
everyone named Je@@ an@@ on Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki quickly - except himself - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from the first day .
&quot; from the moment I went to the house and noticed ( Sarah &apos;s ) and Sam &apos;s energies , I sen@@ sed that they were quite compatible , and I thought that throughout the show , &quot; said Je@@ an@@ on Fel@@ lows .
&quot; Sarah is standing on the ground with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be with her , &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki .
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the home visit made her clear last week that Wood could be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the One &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now def@@ aul@@ ted to him , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked whom wood should choose , if not she , she was pu@@ zz@@ led .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I love the remaining girls alike - it &apos;s a tie between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor is broadcast on Wednesday at 7 : 30 pm on Wednesday .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the US - and there were many other teams who sent requests for his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the Bank when he lost a don@@ ka as it did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by league conver@@ sions at his first p@@ unt return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula confi@@ ded to his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity for a p@@ unt return as well as the ongoing game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula continued to show his true face in the dressing room after the game .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ s@@ ula also strengthened Hay@@ ne publicly during his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ er sports re@@ porter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his scrat@@ ched catch and to take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ add@@ t at a p@@ unt restored in the first quarter of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start that Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian followers had hoped for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the field after the F@@ um@@ ble and later talked to the Australian radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 , that he couldn &apos;t introduce himself to his N@@ FL career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the rac@@ er with his Orig@@ in debut back in 2007 when a pass at his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a Que@@ ens@@ land T@@ ry .
overall , it was nevertheless a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

the Free Elec@@ tors call for the hi@@ ring of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high number of refugees .
at the beginning of the F@@ W Aut@@ umn Conference in Groß@@ glo@@ stadt , party and fac@@ tional leader Hubert Ai@@ ki@@ ger warned against a serious crisis at Bavaria schools when there are no new teachers for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to save the schools from collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ zo@@ v .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise we will get rejection in the Bavarian educational system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Free Elec@@ toral Land@@ tag fraction lasted until Friday in the Fran@@ con@@ ian Commune .
actually quite different main themes were planned .
but the record number of refugees now also dominates the free elec@@ torate @-@ meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the subject will refu@@ te the clo@@ ister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ zo@@ v . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protective zones for refugees in Syria , just as existed during the Yugosla@@ vian elections in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not going on , we have to look at the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free vot@@ er boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;

4 people killed after police shooting rubber bul@@ lets on prot@@ esters in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal , after the police shot rubber stories into a crowd demonstrating against the proposed new constitution , an official said on Wednesday .
violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the district of Rup@@ an@@ ten@@ i , about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , Chief Executive Officer , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had assembled outside a police station , casting some of you stones and incen@@ diary bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police used tear gas and then shot into the air before res@@ or@@ ting to rubber feet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not immediately clear why the used rubber floor , known for being able to kill , but traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , apparently produced such a high death rate .
the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern plains where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces that are formed within the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence .
there were also protests in Western Nepal of the ethnic group of the arus that want their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent confron@@ tations since the 10th century .
August killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to split the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal , which has been centrally governed for centuries .
working on a new constitution has been underway since 2008 , but the law@@ makers expe@@ di@@ ted the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legis@@ lators voted on certain cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu this week , and officials said that the new constitution would come into force on Sunday .
construction area planned in the city
the land at the Em@@ den Youth Centre Alte Post is to be rebuilt .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 m2 area .
a mixture of trade , commerce and housing is planned - but there are not concrete offers yet .
Em@@ den - the city of Em@@ den wants to market an area of some 4000 square meters in direct proximity to the Old Post youth centre .
the preparations for this are underway .
the plan is to use the premises for a mixture of trade , trade and living .
you wait for appropriate offers , that is to say by the city .
which investor is in issue is not yet clear .
no contracts have been concluded either .
the town of Em@@ den had a part of the property located on the Ring@@ straße / corner Great street , bought some months ago and demoli@@ shed the building on it .
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the planning of the holiday cottage on the Small Sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor made public plans for the project for the first time .
several An@@ li@@ eger are still worried - they fear the sale of their Freizei@@ tzentrum
for months , behind closed doors was negotiated , g@@ assed , deb@@ ated and drawn .
now the plans for a new holiday cottage on the small sea near Em@@ den are on the table .
the prospective , medium @-@ sized em@@ blem company &quot; System @-@ Bau , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the municipal development committee of the Em@@ den Council .
originally , this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under pressure from the project critic and the F@@ DP group who accused the investors and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ mann moved from the system construction management to the offensive : &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; he said before the council members and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to be able to meet all ru@@ mo@@ urs now .
the roughly ten @-@ twelve million euro project has been in discussion for months .
hef@@ ty reactions among sea @-@ bu@@ den@@ ers , who had come to the meeting , highlighted the pictures and new details about the desired hotel building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , gar@@ land owner and member of the board at the advoc@@ acy of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compl@@ ains : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a giant cla@@ p that overlooks all the other buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also fears like some other project critics that the traffic due to the intended size of the plant would increase sharply : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there must be whole bus@@ loads to pay off , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schulz &quot; &quot; &quot;
what happens exactly on the site of the former inn , which is just over a hectare large area , is still open .
there is no operator yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we need to have a coher@@ ent concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ end . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this was still missing , the construction plans are still variable .

Google starts dou@@ bling donations campaign to collect 11 million $ for refugees
Google Inc ( Goo@@ gl . O ) announced a dou@@ bling donation campaign to raise 11 million $ for humanitarian organizations that will help thousands of refugees who have over@@ run the European nations as they flee from war @-@ torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to announc@@ ing the Don@@ ation call on its blog .
instead of letting a manager take the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google collabor@@ ator who had fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our journey included many dark web and bus journeys , hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but as the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help .
the donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors With@@ out Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first globally collected donations up to a value of 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / will be doubled to $ 11 million .
Europe is faced with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year .
many escaped from the war torn Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .

weight loss surgery can be helpful for slightly over@@ weight diabe@@ tics .
the advantages of weight loss surgery for obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes may last at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say whether lightly obes@@ e people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; die mort@@ ality dates require a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight @-@ loss surgery , who wrote an editorial on the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Surgery .
weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
over the years obesity &apos;s operations have proven effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most of the studies have been carried out in humans who are obes@@ e with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain degree of weight in terms of size , is considered to be normal between 18@@ ,5 and 24,@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is over@@ weight , and people with BM@@ I above 30 are considered to be obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , researchers from Taiwan &apos;s Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital used data that they have collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c disorder - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily over@@ weight .
the average BM@@ I of those undergoing this operation decreased from 31 to 24@@ ,5 through the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , the BM@@ I remained with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately equal to 29 .
among those who underwent surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes was completely dissolved and 28 % in part .
in the medi@@ cally treated group , the diabetes was completely dissolved only at one percent and partially at only about two percent .
in addition , the results of blood pressure monitoring , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride , and &quot; bad &quot; LD@@ L cholesterol were generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group &apos; , the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored the blood glucose level of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept below 7 per cent , write the researchers .
after the surgery , the average ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c dropped from around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
however , in the medical therapy group it remained stable at about 8 percent .
but this better gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control , as reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level , did not reduce mort@@ ality in five years , so the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the gas rec@@ tom@@ y group ( 18,@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved higher returns in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 5.1 ) and ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3,@@ 1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and reported rather a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show the survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of heavy people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study it was in obes@@ e people who underwent O@@ bes@@ ity surgery , about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods .
although the new study did not benefit the survival of the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was soothing for individuals with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we are waiting too long for people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think that as soon as they have accumulated these genetic changes that have firmly attached their bodies to obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really hard . &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ rück
it is a topic that is increasingly attracting attention in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular and un@@ si@@ ghtly at school times , meets the sho@@ ot@@ est of her youth after years , and she falls in love with her .
so also in the recent novel &quot; Ac@@ tually we are not so &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der .
beyond the love story the novel might be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ rück reader , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .
the full @-@ time author grew up in Lang@@ weiler and is happy that she was able to put a literary monument to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot take up all of the refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis lies in the Middle East . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom during his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford , which dedic@@ ates itself to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admir@@ able , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for anyone to come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama appl@@ au@@ ded Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts in cop@@ ing with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you need to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as real peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end , we need to think about how the killing will be dimin@@ ished in their countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must reduce the use of violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the application of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of violence and also commented on George Bush &apos;s action following the terrorist attack of September 11 and discovered that the violent response of the US attracted a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to resolve this problem lies in non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he put violence and that caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four@@ fold increase in intake of disinf@@ ect@@ ants by children over the past 4 years
toxic control centres in the USA report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 years , which swal@@ low up strongly alcoholic manual disinf@@ ect@@ ants , such as the Georgia Po@@ ison Centre .
according to Dr Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Centre , the cases of revenue from hand dis@@ infection in children under 12 years of age , the poison control centres reported , from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are getting more and more interested in these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them land in the emergency room , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that some children wil@@ fully drink disinf@@ ect@@ ant while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ation in the social media .
videos on YouTube show how young@@ sters drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants only because of a cheap experience .
adolescents have allegedly mixed disinf@@ ect@@ ants with alcohol containing mouth water to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be hoo@@ ked by attractive sc@@ ents of disinf@@ ect@@ ant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand dis@@ infection products ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange scent that are very appealing to children .
disinf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially for small children , few spra@@ yers can lead to alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Th@@ orn@@ ton , medical director of the poison emergency center at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the transmitter Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City .
so , you wouldn &apos;t let slip whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand san@@ i@@ dis@@ infection in reach of children , and when children come to it , then it is a quick way to consume lots of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who had recently taken four sp@@ lashes of but@@ ton@@ er disinf@@ ect@@ ant in school , was brought into an emergency room .
her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold , which was legally in@@ toxic@@ ated by an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor who treated them in the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah wa@@ x@@ ed her words and was not able to walk as she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors monitored her overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital for signs of brain trauma , as the girl fell down by alcohol and had pushed the head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was very sc@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ort@@ oria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or disinf@@ ect@@ ants and to store hand disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
in addition , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were connected with deaths caused by alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation .
in 2013 , two women in Ontario died after swal@@ lowing a disinf@@ ect@@ ant containing a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient .
employees of health authorities suggest that the product contained meth@@ anol , a le@@ thal solution rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was noted as an active ingredient .
in January three students of the fourth grade in the New York State were planning to poison their &quot; m@@ ess &quot; teacher by putting anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; reports a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to disinf@@ ect@@ ant and ban@@ ished her from her room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police looked at the frozen plan as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gesch@@ witz , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and discipl@@ ined disciplinary action to the school authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Griff@@ i@@ ths plays talk about dis@@ cord
there are ru@@ mo@@ urs about dis@@ cord at Celtic Glasgow , what Griff@@ i@@ ths had spontaneously refused . he insist@@ ed that he and his team mates were not under increased control , as they prepare themselves for the confrontation with the Dutch table leader .
I don &apos;t think that we feel under pressure , I think the players will look forward to it .
the lack of title competition in Scottish football - de Bo@@ er
the former ran@@ ger @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic , there is no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the R@@ angers .
de Bo@@ er , currently an Ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; in Holland , they do not show the highlights of the Celtic games and why ? &quot;
it &apos;s because the ran@@ gers are not there .
people here talk not only about the return of the ran@@ gers .
you can speak about the Old Firm .
they talk about both teams and that &apos;s what they are interested in .
there is a lot of tension in the Old @-@ dos games , and it &apos;s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn things around , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la .
Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic has to fight but the Norwegian boss sw@@ ings to turn things around .
after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the following ex@@ cre@@ tion from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen followed , which now stands at the top of the table with five points ahead .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic had bad times before , and we &apos;ll come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel this exactly like this - but we must continue .
we really need the support of Celtic , because that makes the players better .
now to stand together is so important .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the former head of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the January @-@ Transfer Window is very different from the summer window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the players coming in the summer have this high season time to integrate what you have seen with our own group during this season .
the team is really good .
sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .

the Hear@@ ts conducted 2 : 1 , when Pat@@ er@@ son was sent from the field and then lost 3 : 2 , but the Red Card of the Defender was later revers@@ ed - the third Red Card of Coll@@ um , which was rev@@ oked in eight months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ eil@@ son remains what he said and insi@@ sts : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no question of integrity , I haven &apos;t commented on any achievement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Griff@@ i@@ ths swe@@ ars to avoid ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le
the in@@ cor@@ rigi@@ ble Hi@@ bee was brief@@ ed after he agreed to have sung a song with offensive texts about former Hear@@ ts player Rud@@ i Sk@@ ac@@ el .
the incident occurred in a pub in the area of Ros@@ eb@@ urn from Edinburgh in front of a Edinburgh Der@@ by in Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le in March 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a Der@@ by , and it was the heat of the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the storm , and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is safe to say that I do not return to Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le if it doesn &apos;t play for Celtic Glasgow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tann@@ adi@@ ce Supervisory Board has confidence in Dun@@ dee @-@ United @-@ Management
Simon Don@@ nel@@ ly insi@@ sts that Dun@@ dee United &apos;s Executive Board still has confidence in the management team to turn things - but it is clear that the decline must end on the playing field .
I think Stephen Thom@@ p@@ son has confidence in us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will bring the guys back to Tra@@ b , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Don@@ nel@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es is happy to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; win &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Hamilton . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es ad@@ mits that his team from Aber@@ deen had to fight desper@@ ately against Hamilton Ac@@ cies to see a seventh consecutive league victory that brought them a lead of five points ahead of Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ on@@ ey &apos;s El@@ f@@ om in the first half .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team that has won anything , in po@@ k@@ ies or le@@ agues that have not won games of this kind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , as it is rising in the United Kingdom .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without labor for the United Kingdom as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was over that of the UK@@ s of 5.5 percent , as showed the figures of the National Statisti@@ cal Office ( O@@ NS ) .
in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 .
in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland dropped to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government &apos;s long @-@ term plan has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost exactly a year ago that Scotland has taken the historic decision to remain part of the UK .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a drop in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot;

why I &apos;m witn@@ essing an execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
somewhat later , except for a late legal intervention , I will watch how a man is brought to death .
when it happens , and I hope it will not happen , I will sit in an audience gallery in the death chamber at the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , when Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison inj@@ ector .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death .
the invitation came for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
when the day drew near@@ er , I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it &apos;s true that journalists are allowed to see Hin@@ ts in the US , and since more applications are available as seats , a mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery takes place to decide who is elected .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media places from 12 to five .
those who are chosen will observe it emo@@ tionally .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will be next to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps close friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so I will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma acc@@ uses me on Twitter to give up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner as he wants it , and you get access .
I compl@@ ained to her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she admitted that she &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could have been able to form@@ ulate better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but she still thinks that it is wrong what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ porter to be present to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that public relations work against capital punishment .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ porter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will be sitting next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please hear the series of pod@@ casts I &apos;ve made .
I don &apos;t want to go down here again for all the details .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Bar@@ ry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a benef@@ ici@@ ary of the deed .
but I believe that there is a strong likel@@ ihood that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is false .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I can &apos;t claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ porters you can turn to .
what you will get from me is what it means to die a man an unnecessary death .
man after wet police ch@@ ase persu@@ aded to come out of the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale Po@@ lic@@ eman was dry when he was talking to the man of the C@@ anning River .
an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to hang the police was un@@ successful when he was in the shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , a few meters from a police officer trying to persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale called for a break @-@ in incident in Bas@@ ham on Tuesday .
when they discovered the suspect , he tried to escape them towards C@@ anning River .
but he did not come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in the water and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not coming out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said senior ser@@ ge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A good polic@@ eman &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said senior ser@@ ge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine .

in 2006 , C@@ ous@@ ins drove his car into the dit@@ ch to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim over the S@@ wan River .

Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threat@@ ens to end racing
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he pointed to the ste@@ wards and the Racing Victoria integration department , claiming that they had a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
M@@ oo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media , that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it came to the positive cob@@ alt @-@ tasting at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he had kept back 18 months because of the sp@@ ying accus@@ ations and didn &apos;t want it to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; look like too high hanging grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I have sat for a long time , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out suddenly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it continued .
sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to walk around with raised head and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them .
if they start thinking I don &apos;t do that , then I shouldn &apos;t be a trainer .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
previously M@@ oo@@ dy had the bomb explo@@ ded in an interview with rac@@ ing.com , that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stall .
&quot; eighte@@ en months ago Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart sat in a room with a man - whom I will call when asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com .
they obviously believe that I am a sc@@ am .
if that is the case , they should certainly remember their n@@ oses because they failed in trying to touch me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former chairman of R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ die , president of R@@ V@@ L and Bernard S@@ undry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at the time and are still today .
should I think it will be personally ?
does the R@@ V@@ L behave in a cow@@ ard@@ ly manner and perhaps makes people outside of trainers responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe the people out there think I am .
perhaps they have to take my license and cast me off , and I have no doubt that what I say is now thinking about it .
but I have now arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter and that makes me sad .
this really makes me sad .
I will put pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the trainer &apos;s fru@@ stration levels have set up with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt investigation near Li@@ dar@@ i , and L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching said he said he could &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot;
M@@ oo@@ dy , best known by his preparation for the un@@ defeated Master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the schedule &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse debate , which viol@@ ated the rules .
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of my employees has mistakenly applied mud on the leg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been like yesterday evening .
it could have been the whole day yesterday , which was so .
but it was also on the race day .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack on the racing day . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all want to see that we need rules , but here one has gone too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy returns against ri@@ vals for claims to ring fighting
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has described criticism of the Tac@@ kl@@ ing of its players as &quot; agenda setting &quot; of two Premier League favorites of the N@@ R@@ L .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ ster trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the arbit@@ ers allowed the Storm players &quot; ring fights &quot; with his team during the high storm &apos;s victory in the qualifying fin@@ als in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos coach Way@@ ne B@@ enn@@ ett made a very hard note about the Storm team after his team had scored the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; model example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in the rings .
Bell@@ amy defended the tac@@ king of his crew and said that they were focused only on their &quot; contact . &quot;
Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading trainers in his team was confident about him , as they were worried that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it always appears again - I have not heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson said about ring fights when they met us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we have not changed our def@@ en@@ sive system or techniques throughout the year . but over the last six weeks , we have made our contact with Tac@@ icles a real focus and that has provided the turn@@ around for us .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years and he obviously has a great team to train . he is probably not used to losing it , so it was a bit of shock for him .
it is funny how this occurs again and again at this time of the year .
Bell@@ amy has attacked B@@ enn@@ etts &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football , &quot; and reminds his ment@@ or that B@@ enn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League with &quot; boring &quot; football in 2010 .
Way@@ ne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he compared his game on Saturday evening with our on Friday evening and how exciting their game was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Way@@ ne said he would take care of a j@@ unk .
but now he has a team that can play and which we see as exciting , especially his young players at their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play when you have these kinds of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben H@@ unt so they can play like this .
I build stronger faith because they say these things because they are a bit worried about playing against us .
six weeks ago , they probably didn &apos;t think of us when it was about the big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the Storm against R@@ oo@@ ster scored a higher result than the match bron@@ cos vs. cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more trials in our game , but is that an exciting game ?
or are breaks and no points something exciting ?
for me , it &apos;s the game plans .
when they tell us , it means that we will meet them in a single phase .
the Storm team has released this weekend because they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on the next Saturday evening in the final in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
bier with 200.000 $ deposit after drug ank@@ ering
a man who could possibly have a lifel@@ ong sentence for his attempt to get into possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine smu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land was released against a deposit of $ 200,000 .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , who came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ defend@@ ants in the marina during the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite a possibly life @-@ length penalty for trying to possess a commercial quantity of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to own the whole amount and that in the café could have been a harmless reason .
the judge of the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was concerned about the danger of escape from Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he explained to the Court on Wednesday .
in the case of a criminal case , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of $ 200,000 to ensure his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the sworn aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its of the two people it is clear that the circulation of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Richter Flan@@ agan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone will not be enough to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released on b@@ ail , subject to the conditions that he / she gives off to his Australian and his Serbian passport , registers with the police every day and stays at an exit lock between 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident on A@@ 5 near Karlsruhe : the driver &apos;s cab spl@@ its apart
in case of a collision with three trucks on the highway 5 near Karlsruhe a truck driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening .
two of the three trucks involved had bra@@ ked in front of a permanent building in the direction of Basel .
the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to devi@@ ate from the left at the last moment , as the police announced .
the driver &apos;s cab of the crash culp@@ tor ri@@ pped completely apart .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed for six hours to 2 o &apos;clock .
the result was a damage of 12@@ 2,000 Euros .
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used phone of girls to l@@ ure ped@@ ophi@@ le to send pictures
a ped@@ ophi@@ le used the phone of an 11 year old girl to request pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the girl &apos;s phone when she slept and logged in to an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a series of in@@ decent images of children sent to him by another user .
the girl later woke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping H@@ og@@ g .
she saw it , found the conf@@ using messages and immediately al@@ armed her mother .
the police took care of it and looked at the five pictures , then analyzed computers found under the address and discovered &quot; appropriate &quot; web searches , which used words to search for in@@ decent images of children .
H@@ og@@ g then claimed to the officials that he did it because it would lead to &quot; ped@@ ophi@@ le on the internet , &quot; and he then &quot; preten@@ ding to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are her . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the attorney E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on told the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said it would be an ad@@ diction - that he was addic@@ ted to sc@@ aring people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he admitted that the searches on the computer were carried out by him , but said it was happening because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are ped@@ ophi@@ le .
he was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure them .
he said he was sick in the head when he drinks , and said he would then see pictures of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was trem@@ bling and weeping .
she then also saw the in@@ decent pictures on the phone and confronted the accused with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused computer and pla@@ yst@@ ation used to speak to girls who looked much younger than he .
H@@ og@@ g , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty according to the indictment , to have in@@ decent images of children on the 14th of June last year , and did not appear before court for a hearing on March 24 of this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defence lawyer Gregor S@@ im asked H@@ og@@ g not to appear in the sexual crimes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; criminal off@@ ences because one could argue that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be found in his crime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff A@@ list@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postpon@@ ed the verdict until October to receive background reports on social work .
H@@ og@@ g was granted security deposit in this case , but was kept in custody for hear@@ ings in other cases pending .
he was taken up before the date of the judgment into the directory of sexual offen@@ ders .
smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers switch to small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are taken away from the main control points on the German @-@ Austrian border .
many of the hau@@ ls were afraid of the discovery and sei@@ z@@ ure of people at smaller border cross@@ ings .
on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said .
more than 1000 refugees have been taken up since Tuesday along the river Inn river Inn in Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn .
they were on foot via bridges and wei@@ rs to the German side .
there they are received by Federal Police Offic@@ ers and forwarded to the registry .
in comparison to the week &apos;s beginning on Wednesday , the Munich Central Station again met significantly more refugees .
around 700 people had arrived in the provincial capital alone until 8@@ am , said a spokes@@ man in the morning .
after the re@@ introduction of controls at the German @-@ Austrian border , 17@@ 59 refugees reached the city on Tuesday .
Stuttgart : look@@ out of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; in the southwest
meteor@@ ologists warn against storm clouds in the southwest from Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low pressure area over Western Europe , currently warm sea air flows into the country , the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) shared in Stuttgart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the powerful Deep is the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the tropical storm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which has been pulled over the Atlantic over the past few days . &quot; &quot; &quot;
heavy storms and thunder@@ storms are mainly expected in Baden .
according to D@@ WD , the Black Forest is still in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the Lake Constance District with bends from 60 to 90 kilometres per hour .
on Friday , the sun can be seen again for a longer time .
the crowd makes it : every two years the car makers show their novel@@ ties at the IAA .
in 2015 , the compact cars are mainly moving , which are currently being sold very well .
cars from the compact class are currently in great demand : around 28.@@ 1 percent of new registrations were accounted for by the Federal Aviation Office ( KBA ) alone in August .
this is also reflected at the IAA ( public days 17 to 27 September ) .
a lot of new compact models will be introduced this year between all the futur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars .
one of the largest premi@@ eres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be available at deal@@ er@@ ships in autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann .
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is not to be much more expensive either .
Opel is entering the world &apos;s biggest competi@@ tor , VW Golf , which starts at 17,@@ 650 euros .
the current Astra costs 16 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is available with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
the H@@ essi@@ ans also offer further diesel and gasoline engines ranging from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for which three @-@ cylinder petrol engines are also included .
unlike the major competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is only five @-@ door .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the station wagon , which is already visible at the IAA .
and what will happen next to the Astra at the IAA in new compact cars ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra @-@ competi@@ tor Mé@@ gan@@ e into the race .
at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is to be seen exclusively as five @-@ door in a conventional and accentu@@ ated sporty GT version .
in the trade , he comes in early next year , then also as a comb@@ i .
Infin@@ iti : new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
with the new model , the Nissan cabinet wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment .
the compact Infin@@ iti with its curved lines adapts completely to the design line of the brand .
the basic model will receive a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which makes its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter tur@@ bo@@ charged engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
the maximum torque is calculated according to manufacturer &apos;s specifications at 170 Nm ( Nm ) .
sales launch of the bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
DS 4 : not completely new , but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4 , which can be seen at the IAA .
outside the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n design laid hands on the front . here the radiator gri@@ lle was re@@ drawn and the changed head@@ lights equipped with LED technology .
in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ainment system was modernis@@ ed above all , reducing the number of buttons by a touch screen and integrated for the first time Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play .
at the IAA in the compact class there were also a number of re@@ visions and new variants such as the ris@@ ky Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI .
J@@ VA Berlin Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are in@@ humane
the Federal Constitutional Court gave a right to an ex @-@ prisoner of the pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary institution Te@@ gel , which had been housed in a small cell for months .
because of the violation of their human dignity , det@@ ain@@ ees are entitled to financial compensation as they are housed in small cells .
that was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday .
according to the judges , the parties can even hope for money if they were locked up only a few days in the confined spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 Bv@@ R 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
as a result , an ex @-@ det@@ ain@@ ee with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was lod@@ ged in a single cell with approximately five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was spati@@ ally not separated .
after that , the man who , according to his lawyer , has now returned to a larger cell , was transferred to a larger cell .
his terms of office because of the un@@ dig@@ ni@@ fied conditions of detention against the Land Berlin failed .
however , the Constitutional Jud@@ ges took up the judgment of the Berlin Court of Justice and rejected the case for re @-@ examination .
they see the man &apos;s dignity viol@@ ated .
chamber court now decides on the amount of compensation
even if there were only a few days of imprisonment for compensation for legal reasons , a compensation claim was given , it was said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to fear the protection of the personality would be to be feared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chamber judgment must now clarify the amount of money compensation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners of war in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so they spoke only in April to a det@@ ain@@ ee of damages because he was imprisoned naked in a cell .
according to a decision of 2011 , the multiple assignment of a cell without separate toilet is in@@ humane .
in addition , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court on Wednesday that a det@@ ain@@ ee had agreed a decent housing in a parallel case in November 2009 .
the former plain@@ ti@@ ff was lod@@ ged daily between 15 and 21 hours daily in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
in recent weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons have also been in the head@@ lines due to lack of personnel .
prisoners are therefore locked up for 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ veness is increasing , even to be beaten by the ten@@ se situation .
according to information from the Justiz@@ pres@@ est@@ elle , there are 21 vac@@ ancies in Te@@ gel for young people not occupied , 19 are to be cancelled in 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are creating that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the immigration of refugees is a tremendous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what comes to Germany ?
according to forecasts published by the Federal Ministry of Interior , around 800@@ ,000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany this year , according to Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to take up a million refugees .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) has shown determination in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; I say again and again : we can do this and we create that . &quot;
what comes to Germany provides the following overview .
according to various forecasts , between 3@@ 50@@ 000 ( estim@@ ation of the Federal Ministry of Finance ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estim@@ ation of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments are annually - and for the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it has been built up to now ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
the lack of living space is dramatic above all with affordable rental properties : every year , 60@@ 000 to 80@@ 000 social housing units fall out of the rental price range , and for these particularly favourable apartments the refugees will also apply .
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) therefore aims to double the funding , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
this is far too little from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing per year would have to be built and therefore the federal government would have to invest a total of 6.@@ 4 billion per year .
scientists and Federal Minister of Finance agree that there must also be more tax benefits for investment in housing construction .
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , 55 per cent of the refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term .
however , in Germany , the refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their qualifications to help them get started , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
but for the integration of refugees , it is crucial whether they find work in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work is the key to social contacts , the appreciation in the recording society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of immigrants , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ es@@ hardt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to th@@ ru@@ th@@ hardt , there has been a political turn@@ around in Germany : from the prohibition of labour for refugees to recognise work .
while there was a ban on employment for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years earlier , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the Residen@@ z@@ pf@@ licht , which limits asylum seek@@ ers to a residence .
in society - also because of the shortage of skilled workers - the view is mostly enforced that refugees should be allowed to access the labour market more quickly .
the lack of German knowledge is a major barrier to access to the labour market .
up to now there is no sufficient supply of general and job @-@ related language courses .
studies also show that jobs are most often medi@@ ated through personal contacts .
for this reason , the structure of networks is the king &apos;s path to work integration , according to th@@ ron@@ cum@@ en@@ hardt .
the Berlin school administration has found that only a few fled parents give their children to the kit@@ es , an estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; it is very important for the un@@ rooted parents to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ Chemicals , spokes@@ man for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration .
in order to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ book in different languages .
should the need for educ@@ ators rise sharply due to the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase training capacities , for instance by allowing more technical colle@@ ges .
in the countries , students without knowledge of German will be prepared for tuition in welcome classes .
but they are not always taught by trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language .
there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate &apos;s suit@@ cases from the Berlin School administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk appreci@@ ates that approximately 20 percent of the refugees wish to study in Germany .
in principle , no federal land asylum seek@@ ers or tolerated the study - the only exception was Berlin , inner sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned his stance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; willing refugees could be reli@@ eved of access to the university . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because refugees with a residence permit or de@@ formation do not receive services according to the asylum application law more if they start studying .
the latter basically do not receive a B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , since they do not fall under the circle of the yellow @-@ leg@@ ged persons .
tolerated refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be entitled to B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1 January 2016 , this span is shortened to 15 months .
but also this financing gap has to be shut down , Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
the students should immediately get B@@ af@@ ö@@ g .
Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should succ@@ essively claim to Islam the same rights as the churches have , and the existing state @-@ churches right to further develop a new state @-@ religion ratio .
also important would be the establishment of an Islamic Wel@@ fare Association , who takes care of the newcom@@ ers professionally .
the rights also include obligations .
in this way , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contacts and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and to grant him certain control options .
this also includes the willingness to take heed to religious fundament@@ alism .
the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be carried into Germany .
those who wanted to au@@ gment such conflicts in Germany , &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ rische Rundfunk .
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
integration will in future be much more than today an issue of the whole society .
in this way , the majority society will also need to change , the reduction of discrimination and racism is more urgent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany has - as a result of European decisions - have been an anti @-@ discrimination agency and a general gender equality law since the last decade . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it lear@@ ns very slowly , as the NS@@ U @-@ murder series was showing that the rac@@ ist motif systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive in the police and authorities .
equal opportunities for all : what migrants &quot; organisations and the interest groups of non @-@ white German are demanding for a long time and for what international tre@@ aties such as the anti @-@ racism agreement in Germany commit , must become reality in the coming years if the country is peaceful and its new citizens should use their possibilities - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany is able to medi@@ cally provide the expected refugees , says President Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; as far as man@@ - power and capacities are concerned , we create that , &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel .
however , additional money needed to flow into the system .
to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery calls on all newcom@@ ers to hand over health cards immediately .
services rendered could later be settled with the federal states .
and in the long term it is highly question@@ able to leave so many people with the restricted service catalogue that the asylum application law fores@@ ees .
otherwise , the doctors do above all to create language barriers .
already so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are less educated about their diseases than other patients .
not only in clinics , but also in doctor &apos;s offices , interpre@@ ting costs would have to be taken over .
but it would have helped many refugees with more general medical centres in emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic view .
for example , among refugee children there are clearly more untreated disabilities , and in young people it is about HIV education .
with the partially other illnesses , German doctors come from their education but clear , says Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation and tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to detect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and as for the medical angel , the refugees may even be reli@@ eved of relief . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syrians would have a highly developed education system ; several refugees are even doctors .
in order to practise , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly take ex@@ ams again .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are psych@@ ologically ill , according to estimates by the Bundes@@ psycho@@ therapist Association ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most of them suffer from a post@@ traum@@ atic stress disorder or depression .
refugee children are particularly vulnerable , explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recently published study by the TU Munich proves that every fifth Syrian refugee camp will arrive after a traum@@ atic incident in Germany .
anyone suffering from a post@@ traum@@ atic stress disorder is suffering from so @-@ called flash@@ backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart rate , and death .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration problems , severe ap@@ athy and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
to prevent the symptoms from chronic , early treatment was necessary , explained Mun@@ z .
to date , however , only four percent of the psych@@ ologically ill refugees receive psycho@@ therapy .
although psych@@ ologically ill asylum seek@@ ers can apply for psycho@@ therapy in the social offices , the treatment usually lasts for several months .
in addition , in the social offices , mostly cler@@ ks or doctors who are not trained for mental illness decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
with the new staging &quot; Passion , &quot; Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of cir@@ cus art .
the goal is to attract each age group into the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment .
now the cir@@ cus rehear@@ se invites you to dream on a tile on a tile .
&quot; our passion is cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst , animal trainer and junior boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - this is the motto of the current &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Man@@ e@@ gen@@ plan@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for more than 33 years , the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family .
thus , the gift for the lovers is in the blood of the family .
&quot; it is important for us to get people away from their everyday life and to take them to a completely different world for two hours , &quot; stresses the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; almond drink with a world @-@ city flair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst , his concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the barely 3 000 km long tour can now experience this flair .
the cir@@ cus programme convinces with talented artists from all over the world .
excellent at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown family captiv@@ ates the audience with wi@@ t and charm .
the Castillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of the silent movies , the Cub@@ an duo wants to absorb the Cub@@ an duo .
light@@ ness and ag@@ ility - with these words they identify themselves .
her humor@@ ous art on the mast is meant to conquer female hearts by storm .
apart from numerous salmon sal@@ v@@ ations , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ates with dex@@ ter@@ ity and jo@@ in@@ ness .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasizes Steph@@ an@@ ie &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitude of cir@@ c@@ uses are only too often subject to various animal welfare organisations .
Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst also takes a position : &quot; if it is not good for our animals , we are not going well . &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged arti@@ stes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as they are lovingly called , will be read from the eyes whenever possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel comfortable , it does not want to go into the man@@ ege .
the upper@@ most commandment therefore : good for the animals .
especially on its zeb@@ roid jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land Pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a zeb@@ ra mare , the Pro@@ bst family is proud .
the two animals lived together eight years in an enclosure and nothing happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the zeb@@ roid is not yet ready for the arena , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Circus Pro@@ bst .
there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing is certain , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether five or a hundred spectators , we always do our best and are with all my heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on September 17 @-@ 20 , the Circus Pro@@ bst looks forward to welcoming you at 5 p.m. and 8 p.m .
on Sunday the program starts at 11 am and 4 pm .
Thursday is family day , for the performance at 5 pm the prices are reduced .

Zim@@ bab@@ we@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe holds wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest guide , fell down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly spread over social media .
the opening of the Parliament was also clou@@ ded by asser@@ tions by members of the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and were warned against accompanying Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s address with bu@@ y@@ outs .
last month , they had burned him and interrupted him during his speech on the position of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man for Democratic Change ( M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their phones that warned them to interfere against Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s address .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but it has the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said to journalists after Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it warns the members of Parliament that the immunity in parliament ends , and as soon as they leave parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the boss said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worried &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hewlett @-@ Packard will build up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett @-@ Packard is expected to build 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the scope of the restructuring and saving efforts in the company &apos;s services .
HP will later split into two listed companies this year , separating the computer and printer business from its fast growing company hardware and its service activities .
the expected loss of jobs leads to a burden of over $ 2.7 billion from the fourth quarter , said HP in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP Chairman and Chief Executive , who is to lead the unit after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and stronger than it is HP today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that support businesses moving to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man .
as a stand @-@ alone company , we are better positioned than ever before to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world .
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual sales and &quot; will be focused on providing unprecedented , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; explains the company .
it spl@@ its a company that was founded in the 19@@ 30s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hewlett @-@ Packard , to produce electro @-@ powered equipment and whose Pal@@ o Alto Garage was called &quot; the birth@@ place of Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to manage the return from traditional PC to mobile devices .
the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies , is the latest in this field , based on the belief that closely focuss@@ ed companies provide better performance .
FC Arsen@@ al @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team@@ mates must stand behind the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger pointed out to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation follows plan there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas .
this optimistic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will be sure to miss at least the next four games for England and in view of its history , its participation in the next summer is certainly still uncertain .
the big shame in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season with a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old momentum during the pre @-@ season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury does not thre@@ aten the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone that does not heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his an@@ kles or with the injuries he had previously .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger recognized , there is the associated risk of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant design .
the study of Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd has listed 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since its debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of arsen@@ als 157 league games in the last five seasons .
the broader picture for Arsen@@ al is that in six out of eight seasons , since 2007 / 08 they were one of the two Premier League clubs that recorded most of the vulner@@ abilities .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the vulner@@ ability will pers@@ ist during the last season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes when you come back from an injury , you have a vulnerable time period , a time in which you need to strengthen your body and gain fighting power , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the kind that he deserves .
Arsen@@ al starts his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb before playing against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur next Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger introduces himself to a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , meaning Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta should start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and allow the players who need it to take a little break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although arsen@@ al &apos;s clear favourites are to pass through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadion in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest intim@@ id@@ ation effect in Europe .
dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign was launched in the last season .
the stadium was sha@@ ken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , where 3,@@ 2 were measured on the Richter scale .
this year it was 10th in Zagreb .
little is the opinion that Arsen@@ al has drawn up the doctrine of the last season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and remains motivated by the far @-@ away hope to lead the association to its first European Cup triumph with its management .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has never worked at Arsen@@ al .
we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
friendship Fest : the com@@ edy show , which gives us serious lessons about men &apos;s friend@@ ships
the absence of similar representations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up , now is more desperate than ever before , such as suicide rates among young men on a 15 @-@ year @-@ high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in males aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than in women .
in an effort to address the problem Camp@@ aig@@ n Ag@@ ainst Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - Camp@@ aig@@ n against a w@@ ret@@ ched life ) announced 2015 as the year of the man , with the aim of ques@@ tioning the culture that hin@@ ders men to seek help if they need them .
friendship is the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge .
a recent study at over 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms confirmed that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery were doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends , so that a friendship can work .
in the age of communication led by social media , with emphasis on substance on substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact .
our digital life has doubled the need to appear strong , fun , and successful , even though in reality the isolation dominates .
this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call extra intrin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of intrin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our spiritual health much more deeply .
and as a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared that money can really not buy money .
the beauty of friends was that this focuss@@ ing was put on the head .
each character was not defined by his work , but by his personality , which shines through interaction as a friend .
the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments at the soccer @-@ watching in comfortable arm@@ chairs and the longing of Ross after Rachel - all this came out of the knowledge that men can relate to it , even if they often with@@ hold themselves completely to explore their feelings .
as a telephone counsel@@ ing employee explained to me : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and com@@ promised has really shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has a tremendous impact as the feeling that it is perceived as weakness when one speaks openly about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
she clearly presents the small moments of male friend@@ ships .
so much my objective out@@ sider &apos;s status over the phone may help people in moments of despair , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , when you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest , this weekend , with the setting completely re@@ designed to celebrate the day , why not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k ?
or , even better , if you see someone sitting around in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give him a smile and say h@@ ello .
you never know what difference your friendship could do .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from start to finish - the total 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to cr@@ ush Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria is celebrating with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hit on Malm@@ ö .
di Maria makes his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass to Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani were on course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ Park@@ stadium on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League Deb@@ ate as a PS@@ G player who brought the French master to the way , but after that they missed a number of occasions , before they finally raised their lead when Cav@@ ani made a head ball@@ point in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Chess t@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish master because they do not only asp@@ ire to qualify for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while she got the points , there was no clas@@ sy of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c missed chances in front of the gate . he was later replaced by his hom@@ etown team and against the club with which he began his illustri@@ ous career in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 , cause problems to our opponents and look relaxed , even if there are certain things we have to perfect in the course of the season , &quot; Blanc said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good omen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we won &apos;t have one or two more goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after his injury , I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned to the Paris @-@ Team after his injury , which ended on the weekend a 2 : 2 Draw on their own seat against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was cast out in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
the Argent@@ inian wing storm was referred to as the man who took the PS@@ G to the next level in Europe when he was taken over in the last month of Manchester United , and he indicated why when he passed in Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis pass behind the Malm@@ ö Defence before joining Johan Wil@@ and in the long corner of the network .
but if someone believed that PS@@ G would win a big win , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö hit Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach this stage , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players in the field and was a heavy opponent with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field .
but besides a shot of Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps &apos;s posts in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little to attack .
instead , PS@@ G itself sometimes gave up , with some mis@@ prints and bad deals , last but not least by I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who had been scrat@@ ching in the first half by no less than five attempts , and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used it after re@@ bo@@ oting .
nevertheless , he showed a lot more skill if he put his fellow players into play , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c that Di Maria turned into a shoot , which was directed by Wil@@ and at the 5@@ 2nd minute by the post ...
the second gate finally fell short after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ er thus achieved his sixth year &apos;s goal after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had f@@ ished a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
this ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö could come back to play , and only an excellent intervention from Wil@@ and from the very short distance to stop David Lu@@ iz could keep the final result even before replacement player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi provided a gate at the end .
the trainer of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class above his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December .
since then we have only played in the Swedish league , which has not the same level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the qualifying matches are not enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hats off to Paris !
it was a great game of them !
Gl@@ en@@ core collects 2.5 billion $ through stock sales
the mining giant Gl@@ en@@ core , based in Switzerland , which is affected by the collap@@ sing raw material prices , collected 2.5 billion $ on Wednesday by a stock sales as part of its huge debt @-@ off plan .
the Gl@@ en@@ core registered in London said in an explanation that it sold new shares worth $ 1.6 billion to pay off their own debts .
the company , which lost 57 percent of its market value this year , fights with falling commodity prices , as China &apos;s economic down@@ turn presses demand and has a devastating effect on markets .
the issue of subscription rights brought a fierce surge to the top of the London stock exchange trading on early Wednesday morning .
the share jump@@ ed by 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1.@@ 60 p@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 index , which opened 0.@@ 69 percent higher .
Gl@@ en@@ core had announced last week the 2.5 billion $ stock sales as part of the more comprehensive plans to cut around a third of its $ 30 billion debt .
the company sold the new shar@@ ehol@@ dings to 125 P@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday .
there were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.@@ 99 percent of the Group .
concerns regarding a long @-@ term growth in China have reduced iron ore prices by about half , coal , copper and other raw material prices have declined by 20 to 40 percent .

white House confirms Xi Jin@@ p@@ ings visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping will make a state visit to the US at the end of the month confirmed the White House in an explanation on Tuesday .
the visit , xis first official in Washington , takes place on 25 September and responds to President Barack Obama &apos;s trip to Beijing last November , said the statement .
the US president and the First Lady Mich@@ elle Obama will also host Xi and his wife Pen@@ g Li@@ y@@ uan at a state d@@ iner after the two leaders have held bilateral talks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President George &apos;s visit will offer the opportunity to expand American cooperation in a number of global , regional and bilateral issues of common interest , but at the same time President Obama and President Xi can give the opportunity to construc@@ tively approach areas of dis@@ agreement , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adds the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
XI , whose visit was initially announced in February , will likely meet several U.S. technology leaders in Seattle on his way to Washington before travelling to New York City to the UN General Assembly in September .
it is expected that Obama and Xi are addressing a number of controversial issues , including Washington &apos;s concerns regarding alleged cy@@ ber @-@ sp@@ ying of China and its increasing self @-@ confidence in the disputed waters of the South China Sea .

X@@ avi : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented 2008 change to FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ avi has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
the FC Bayern obviously stood before the obligation of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ avi , who was playing for FC Barcelona at that time .
eight times Spanish champion , three times cup champion , four times champion league winners , twice World Champions , twice World Champion , once World Champion - the title list of X@@ avi is breathtaking .
in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left the FC Barcelona after 24 years and switched to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca X@@ avi says that he was already before the European Championship before the departure from Barcelona .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one told me that Bar@@ ça wanted to sell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Madrid won everything back then , we don &apos;t know anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the registered also FC Bayern .
X@@ avi : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted me to have me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the summer of 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over FC Bayern .
Guardi@@ ola was the reason X@@ avi did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this is now working for the German record leader : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ avi explains why : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has signed a contract for Guardi@@ ola and I played a great European Championship &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I would not change that he could not imagine the crew without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he got me with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bay@@ erns were running with X@@ avi in 2008 / 2009 .
X@@ avi was for Bar@@ ca in the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bavarian over the whole distance on the grass , switched the reds ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the King &apos;s Triumph at the end .
matt Dam@@ on plays diversity in film creation
matt Dam@@ on confronted the af@@ ro@@ amer@@ ican film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion on the diversity and said she was not needed behind the scenes .
during a series of Sunday night from HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown interrupted the need for alternative perspectives in terms of a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen script of the project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we talk about diversity , then do it with the occupation of the film and not with the occupation of the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dam@@ on assured . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; brown re@@ acted with offen@@ ded un@@ belief and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the actors &apos; comments soli@@ di@@ fied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producing colleagues Ben Aff@@ l@@ eck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to encourage people to think about it - whoever will be the director - how to handle the figure of the Harmony , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only black person , and she is a nun , who is beaten by her white p@@ im@@ p .
the producer of De@@ er White People was campaig@@ ning for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for directing right to the film ; Dam@@ on replied that her direction &quot; in the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was broad@@ cast@@ ed , the social media explo@@ ded against exposure to Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
Twitter user Mr Po@@ oni squee@@ zed his anger about the clip by writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on speaks about the only black person in space , so he can explain their diversity - that is SO WE@@ ISS that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
the T@@ we@@ et has served more than 5,000 rescue we@@ ets and 4,000 rec@@ kes since its publication .
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments arrive at a time when the exact racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion .
after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed by a white polic@@ eman in 2014 , the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement achieved national action and urged legis@@ lators and authorities to stop discrimin@@ atory practices against bul@@ lying .
in February the singer Prince made an all@@ usion to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; album silent matter &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
like books and black lives , albums still have their meaning .
in recent times leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement have issued a statement in response to the question of the Fox News personality , Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate @-@ group .
&quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders .
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ ets invited to visit the Pope in order to discuss the presentation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; crowns first champion
professional sport clim@@ ber and operating aid Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ lete to win the American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday night and took home the Grand Prize of $ 1 million .
the competition show , which just graduated its 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant which could complete all stages of its obstacle course .
during the season fin@@ als there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , to the final .
the last task was the climbing on a 75 @-@ foot climb rope in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time with which he was the first ath@@ lete to finish the ar@@ du@@ ous phase 4 of the American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge full three seconds faster , which made him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! News after the hard @-@ fought victory , still under shock about winning the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned or lived more than $ 10,000 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap of money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how it is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer , K@@ ent We@@ ed , sat down with The Hollywood Re@@ porter to discuss the fin@@ als and why Brit@@ ten , although he first finished the course , won &apos;t receive any prize money .
according to the rules , money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and life changes , he gets the great gratu@@ ity .
I don &apos;t think he holds a gru@@ dge about it .
he is just so happy to have done what he has done .
he received masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family man .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be struck by someone , then I &apos;m glad that it is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Isaac would have felt the same if they had replaced the roles .
America Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or was extended for an eighth season , filming will start in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ aks past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ ER@@ O@@ L@@ ISH --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
previously they were once one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the tig@@ ers stand on the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part perfectly on Tuesday with the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target field .
T@@ wins wa@@ sted a chance to climb inside a half of the Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League wild@@ card space .
for Detroit , although only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word that was so hard to summari@@ ze over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all victories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tig@@ ers manager Brad Aus@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon held his early offensive support when Detroit scores three times in the first two in@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then again in ninth time .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) suggested 6 times in the 1 / 3 inn@@ ings and allowed three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s hard to throw at bul@@ l@@ bars any game , and therefore I want to go very focused into the game .
the designated tiger hit Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two runs , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was Mart@@ ine@@ z &apos;s first three @-@ hit game since he had four hits against the Seattle Navy on July 6th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he sw@@ ung the punch wood well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Zimmer@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at ( stroke ) , looked much better at the bul@@ l@@ record , and he brought it straight into the game .
with three R@@ uns in the back meeting at the end of the seventh inning , T@@ wins had their best chance to come back into play .
center Fiel@@ ds B@@ yr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton completed the inning with a double at the left field line .
right Fiel@@ ds Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a B@@ unt and Simon brought his second bass player Brian Do@@ zier to the Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
har@@ dy over@@ ran the wall , the only man he was confronted with , before the designated ro@@ ok@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who escaped the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen a Two @-@ Run .
with a pair of runners and the finishing run on the second , Ver@@ ha@@ ge brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a Double Play .
it was the 27th time in the Major League , the 27th time in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe struck a double play
after developing a Insurance Run at the end of the ninth inning , Berlin created a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the status of 5 @-@ 4 .
however , the right @-@ handed people left S@@ ano at three pit@@ ches for his fifth save .
Detroit benefited at the start of the game by an even non @-@ moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the tig@@ ers scored three rounds in the first two in@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been canc@@ eled before the game from the vulner@@ ability list after he had been missing more than a month due to a back pain .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wished for , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt more comfortable than I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pitch there in the third inning . &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off @-@ Bat@@ ter , Hus@@ band released a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler .
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into the game that made a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z achieved his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the Run@@ ners in the scor@@ ing position .
the third bass player Nick Castell@@ an@@ os followed with a single at the right side , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat .
the tig@@ ers laid in the second , achieved a one @-@ out double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out single from Center Fiel@@ ds Anthony GO@@ SE at 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; that was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins manager Paul Mol@@ itor .
he did not beat very well , but he got the right place .
Hu@@ gh@@ es found himself in a pitch @-@ count , scored no points in the third inning before being replaced by the rel@@ ic@@ t A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there were three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four kn@@ itted lines .
remarks : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to a violation of the wor@@ ship@@ pers .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who operated the San@@ che@@ z shoulder in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the vulner@@ ability list because of a shoulder rig , is to be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP will be cancelled by the vulner@@ ability list to start T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30th
he has been missing in the right hip joint since August 20th .
the Tig@@ ers and T@@ wins will end their series of three games at the target field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2.@@ 4.@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 )
hundreds of refugees should perish in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
the people who arrived in it should then be accommodated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , as the city of Wiesbaden hur@@ ried on Tuesday evening .
it reck@@ ons with 450 to 750 incoming refugees .
several sports halls of the H@@ esse state capital have been prepared in recent days for this case .
up to 1000 refugees can temporarily stay there .
they should then be distributed to other communities .
in the past ten days alone , 7@@ 500 people in H@@ esse have arrived in H@@ esse , according to the District President responsible for the first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt and Han@@ au have also set up emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls due to the large number of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
the Director of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German participation in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe that decisive re @-@ thinking about military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he proposed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective bar@@ gain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the European states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago , one was happy that the ch@@ ali@@ ce passed by a military stake in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict lands on our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deut@@ schland@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid on the ground for the refugees .
Austria controls southern and eastern borders
after Germany , too , Austria has again introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders .
Austrian Minister of the Interior , Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , explained on Tuesday evening in Austrian TV station ORF , no one will be sent back to Hungary now .
Germany too did not send refugees back to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , it &apos;s so agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of an agreement that Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria a day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said , I have already had talks between the General Director for Public Security and Represent@@ atives of Germany .
she did not give concrete figures and pointed out talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
tens of thousands of refugees over the so @-@ called Bal@@ kan@@ route from Hungary came to Austria in the past few days .
your destination is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann requested a special summit next week together with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had begun with temporary border checks on Sunday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states haven &apos;t been able to agree on a joint action in the crisis so far . &quot; &quot; &quot;
next Tuesday ( 22 September ) the EU interior ministers will take a new approach to the binding distribution of further 120@@ ,000 refugees in a special meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the strong refugee flow in Germany , the federal government wants to support the federal states more strongly in the first intake and distribution of people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Con@@ federation will manage this jointly with the countries , announced Mrs Merkel late Tuesday evening after almost four hours of consultations with the Prime Minister in the Chancellor &apos;s Office in Berlin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Merkel under@@ lined those people who needed protection , also be@@ g them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but those who have no perspective of lead can also not stay in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this opinion has been split in the round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole now needs a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; huge effort &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the bal@@ kan route .
Hungary closed its 175 @-@ kilometre border with Serbia on Tuesday night .
a few hours later the government in Budapest announced that the border to Romania had to be demoli@@ shed with a fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this neighbour country is different from Serbia to the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hungary wanted to prevent smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers seeking alternative routes via Romania , Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government promptly condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
according to witnesses of e@@ ye@@ witness reports in Turkey , thousands of more migrants have embark@@ ed on the path to the Greek border .

&quot; &quot; &quot; this includes researchers from observations of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
accordingly , the moon easily stag@@ gers on its orbit around the ring planets .
although this de@@ af movement is only small , but still too large for a permanently solid body of heaven , it is said in a message from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( New York State ) from Tuesday .
the researchers present their analyses in the &quot; I@@ car@@ us . &quot;
for some time it was known that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had already discovered ice @-@ volcan@@ oes in 2006 at the South Pole of Satur@@ n@@ moon , sp@@ it water vap@@ or and ice particles and thus feed the so @-@ called e @-@ ring of Saturn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least at the South Pole , there must be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers closed at that time .
the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clear however .
R@@ ama is missing for several weeks in 1860 München
the 1860 München won &apos;t have to for@@ ego Val@@ et R@@ ama for one month .
an examination showed an ad@@ duc@@ tor injury at the 27 @-@ year @-@ old , the association was informed .
R@@ ama compl@@ ained about pain at the beginning of the week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Munich lion , the diagnosis is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; presumably four weeks of forced break . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is difficult for us , R@@ ama is a serious loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , we have to think now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sport@@ director Nec@@ at Ay@@ g@@ ün , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper with a view of the possible commitment of a uni@@ on@@ less professional . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as training guest , however , the six@@ ties presented a defensive man at first .
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was last active in Belgium and was already under contract at the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Cro@@ at currently has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the possibility to prove his skills . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to his conc@@ ussion , Tor@@ j@@ äger Rub@@ in O@@ ko@@ tie can return to team training next week .
the Austrian national player is supposed to enter the running training on Thursday .
O@@ ko@@ tie had hurt in the game at Fort@@ una Düsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) in a violent clas@@ h at the head .
contrary to the first concerns , however , he remained without a serious cens@@ orship .
no diet fruit - man@@ gos contain a lot of sugar
Mang@@ os are exotic and ju@@ icy and sweet .
but he who wants to take care of his slender line is often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
because man@@ gos contain relatively high sugar - especially su@@ c@@ rose .
nonetheless , the exotic fruits are healthy : they contain B vitamins and vitamins E and C . above all , man@@ gos contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ ursor to beta car@@ ot@@ ene .
who eats the fruits , thus supports vision , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
when buying , man@@ go should not be too soft or too firm and pleasant to smell .
the color alone doesn &apos;t tell about how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ goes can taste very tasty .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .

the US parcel service U@@ PS supplies up to 9@@ 5,000 Euros for the Christmas business in the USA .
the company already started recru@@ iting seasonal workers , U@@ PS announced on Tuesday .
especially drivers are being sought .
last year U@@ PS had increased its workforce for the holiday season by 9@@ 5,000 Euros .
in view of the bo@@ oming online business , U@@ PS and his rival F@@ ed@@ Ex have had previous arrangements since last year in order to be prepared for the Christmas business .
in 2013 , delayed deliveries had brought the parcel service to harsh criticism .
first F@@ öh@@ n@@ sturm , then distinctive cold front
in the coming night , in the valleys of the Alps side of the F@@ öh@@ n , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Switzerland ha@@ st@@ ened on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and on the night to th@@ urs@@ day the fo@@ eh@@ n blows partly with storm @-@ strength through the fo@@ eh@@ ox @-@ valleys .
after gro@@ oming on Thursday morning we cross a marked cold front that brings heavy rainf@@ alls , wind gu@@ sts and a decline in temperature .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low @-@ pressure basin over the British Is@@ les in a strong southwest current .
on the east side of the mountain stops at night to Wednesday of the F@@ öh@@ n through the valleys .
as a result , the F@@ öh@@ n blows from 60 to 100 km / h in the winter valleys with bends from 60 to 100 km / h , partly with more than 100 km / h especially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land .
the fo@@ eh@@ n can advance partly to the adjacent Mitt@@ ell@@ and , and on the mountains there are even hur@@ ri@@ can@@ es of more than 120 km / h possible .
while in the north on Wednesday , stor@@ my hair dri@@ es up for summer temperatures from 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity begins to st@@ ow at the mountain slope .
here rain starts , which lasts until Thursday evening .
in total , in the south of the Alps , over the next 48 hours , some more than 100 litres of rain per square meter will be expected , this has already fallen into large amounts of rain in the last few days .
on Thursday morning , the fo@@ eh@@ n thro@@ ws out the air , as a result a cold front with a strong , partly swe@@ at@@ y rain from west to east over Switzerland is rolling .
together with the cold front the wind is refreshing strongly until stor@@ my , and the temperatures go back considerably .
the following days are situated in the north autumn with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , on the other hand , it will be sunny and warmer at weekends with up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a Martin Luther square
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther square in Rome .
in the presence of Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino , a hitherto nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was christ@@ ened on the name of the German Re@@ former .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is now recognized as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the park is located right in the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the Arbeits@@ gemeinschaft der evangel@@ ische Kirche in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es over centuries as a minority were often only able to live in their faith .
with the square , it becomes visible in a symbolic way that their tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) beha@@ ved as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k around the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 several months in Rome .
he received the city back then as a corrupt head of sins .
his negative impressions could have encouraged him by historians in his later fight against Rome .
Luther had then introduced the division of the oc@@ ci@@ dental church with his theses against the aband@@ on@@ ment .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) crown of thorns is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt has painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost wrote the introduction and updated Bible text .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Bible , which now appeared with splendid images .
in the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who formulated his personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colourful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has preserved the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; images . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : adapted to the respective subjects , this can be quite glo@@ omy .
Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his Bible project for about three years , for which he has made a subjective and artistic selection from the many topics of the &quot; book of all books . &quot;
cycles have ar@@ isen , which focus on topics like the Way of the Cross , P@@ agues , Command@@ ments , or Our Father &apos;s Prayer .
he immediately fascinated several partners : this is true for Luther &apos;s publishing house with its the@@ ological focus as well as for the Kettler publishing house with its emphasis on art books .
and there is above all the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who dealt with the respective biblical passages on the basis of painting .
he interpreted the biblical passages selected by Ot@@ mar Alt and thus translated into today , into current contexts . &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirror of Al@@ ts painting .
embedded between the original Bible quotation of Martin Luther and one set of the artist , he formul@@ ates his own personal thoughts on the respective situation .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
thus the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high degree of intim@@ acy .
emotions were ultimately the trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family which belonged to the strict Protestant rulers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the up@@ bringing happened already with the cane , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to work it up in order to get me back again with the Lord &apos;s father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to help art again more important in the fast @-@ pac@@ ed era : &quot; today &apos;s perception of visual worlds is marked by advertisements , and that is loud .
symboli@@ sm is being displaced .
artists have a different desire and delight to show things .
images always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt wants to let the viewer go into the pictures , let them work , discover and sense what power they have : &quot; the image is looking for its counterpart . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost stood on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; always to be a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art : &quot; I like how he understands life with his paintings . &quot;
old did not care not to grasp the Bible completely , but to select the most important , also mysterious topics for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was not co @-@ operation at eye level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is the pictures , the text merely explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans Mö@@ h@@ ler from Luther Verlag , this work is an invitation to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deep@@ en His life and find freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s pictures speak for Mö@@ h@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and that of responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition , which will be opened in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation on 15 November .
beginning of construction for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn
plans have been made , companies have been commissioned to model the Earth hü@@ gel for a round course : one year later almost everything was ready - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X train it was over again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; failures in politics and administration ensured a dr@@ uss , especially among the residents who did not want to tolerate the train . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus hill ski@@ pped , new place looked for - now with formal planning and application for building permission .
the approval will go down in October , the First Fri@@ der@@ man Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was informed now in the Children &apos;s and Youth Committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year will happen again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it should then be started with the works of the former indoor swimming pool without &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further commem@@ oration &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies engagement for refugees
the DF@@ B is expanding its commitment to refugees until 2019 , the Bundes@@ liga poses a clear sign at the weekend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football responds to the wor@@ sen@@ ing situation in Germany and ensures policy help in cop@@ ing with the upcoming problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there can be no one in principle , that &apos;s nothing about me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must interest every individual to get a grip on this issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B boss Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to discuss the situation in Germany intensively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am in the chan@@ cell@@ ery next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State Mrs. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic will surely play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
football can and may help .
but the decisive turn@@ out must be the policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Football Federation has therefore expanded its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; over the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun @-@ Foundation , we ensured that this programme continues until 2019 , &quot; explained Nier@@ s@@ bach on the br@@ ink of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
some federal states also support this program .
already on this weekend the 36 professional clubs set a clear sign when on the left tri@@ cot , instead of the usual logo logo ( Her@@ mes ) the print &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can only &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen &apos;s sport manager Rud@@ i Völ@@ ler from the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama passes everyone , nobody can see it away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can use football feder@@ ations , no , we must use our radi@@ ance , influence and opportunities to help the many refugees that have suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s managing director Peter Ret@@ tig was talking about a &quot; prominent sign of the league . &quot;
for the European qualification game against Hungary this Friday , the national team of the women invited 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Nier@@ s@@ bach called the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a big joint venture of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 license agreements had started their own projects in their locations is great .
just as great is that small and the smallest clubs are active .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we spent is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this and next year , the association will share 300 000 Euro for the integration of refugees together with the German Government &apos;s DF@@ B selection and the federal government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have already been calling for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : an eye cat@@ ches an eye in the event of an accident
according to several reports , the head of the board of Europe &apos;s largest software company , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , lost the left eye by a fall in early July .
during the accident at the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the USA he fell on a water glass after midnight , which he carried in the left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s almost bleeding , was impot@@ ent , then drag@@ ged out onto the street - he told us this last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SAP Co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could go after his work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October we meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully working . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he will come back to Germany in October and will continue to lead the software company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am full of SAP , full of my job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; of course I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board all the while and its Chairman , Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the US , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go public with such a personal history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can happen that way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to stand up again when you fall down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren @-@ replacement pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen out of combat ...
Magn@@ us@@ sen t@@ wit@@ tered an appropriate photograph and explained that he suffered the injury when he was over@@ thrown by the wheel .
he therefore comes as little as reserve driver for the two stam@@ pers Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ ens@@ on Button as a spare driver for the two stam@@ pers Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ ens@@ on Button as a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan .
football : Bv@@ B without Re@@ us vs. K@@ ras@@ no@@ dar : wil@@ low F@@ eller in the Game
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us in the first group play of the Europa League have definitely sm@@ ashed .
the national player will miss the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga as well in du@@ el with the F@@ K K@@ ras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19@@ .00 / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately we cannot resort to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether Re@@ us will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ spiel in Le@@ verk@@ usen , the BV@@ B @-@ coach openly admitted : &quot; we expect a return from him to training on Friday . &quot;
given the high load on its pro@@ s , Tu@@ chel will not only alter its trunk @-@ elf on the re@@ us position .
so he announced a change at the door keeper position .
for this reason , Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of St@@ em @-@ keeper Roman citizenship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he trained on an absolute top level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Soccer teacher praised the World Champion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , if Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is used in all Europa League matches in the future , however , Tu@@ chel has left it open .
with high probability he will also contest the second game .
the for@@ ging statement by fellow player Re@@ us that the final draw for the BV@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal , means mi@@ dd@@ ler player Julian W@@ eig@@ l for understanding : &quot; this is not so wrong with Marco . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to pick up the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robot cars : government wants to play a pioneering role in Germany
according to the Federal Government &apos;s will , Germany should be a technological pioneer in the changing of cars .
the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which , among other things , fores@@ ees investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
Do@@ brin@@ dt was speaking at the IAA in Frankfurt on Wednesday at the IAA from a &quot; New Mobility Age . &quot;
automated and connected driving will increase traffic safety and ensure less traffic jams , &quot; said Do@@ brin@@ dt .
he wants to discuss the issue with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 states , which come together with representatives from the industry at the IAA .
among other things , the Ministry of Transport &apos;s strategy paper emphas@@ ises the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and rapid increase in digital radio communication .
for testing new technology a test track is currently being developed on the motorway 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order for the driver to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks be born , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the federal government wants to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check the legal framework &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany wants to apply for example internationally that the permissible maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is increased from 10 to 130 km / h .
the Federal Government is also willing to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which until now only fores@@ ees man as a driver .
when automated driving , the car acceler@@ ates , the driver becomes more and more the passenger .
the technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study submitted by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , driving less vehicles on public roads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can be expected only a long way to 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the authors of the study estimate the value added in the range of driver assistance systems and highly @-@ automated driving functions in Germany to around € 8.4 billion in 20@@ 25 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of cars can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD politi@@ cian S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the question of liability in accidents and the security of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly clari@@ fied .
however , the Germans are still skep@@ tical - much more than Fren@@ ch@@ men or Americans .
a survey conducted on Wednesday by the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the Princip@@ ality of Dek@@ ra comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail in the next ten years , 32 percent do not count on it in 20 years , 31 percent believe not at all .
in France , 21 percent of those sur@@ vey@@ ed up to 20@@ 25 reck@@ on with autonomous driving cars , in the United States 33 percent .
in any case , drivers in Germany are still not ready to rely completely on a self @-@ driving vehicle .
according to a survey by the digital association Bit@@ kom only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire trip on all roads .
at least 15 percent of the traffic in flowing traffic could be seen on the motorway , in St@@ au 45 percent .
well , every fourth would leave the car under no circumstances .
Bol@@ l says team and double start at table tennis @-@ EM
according to current figures , the Düsseldorf wants to open only in singles during the title fight from 25 September to 4 October .
the final decision will be final on 22 September at the latest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the guys have experienced it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to clin@@ ch the title even without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Federal trainer Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the European course in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that time Bol@@ l was on the flight to a long @-@ term agreed sponsor date in China .
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old German champion is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo is the disadvantage , we are no longer such a clear favourite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said single @-@ European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the sett@@ ler list in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also reminded the European Championship 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time Timo was missing , and we have become the European champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should ori@@ ent ourselves , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared the fifth @-@ fifth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the English football team Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United has suffered a serious injury on the right leg .

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant terrible
the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his oeu@@ vre on Wednesday in Munich .
highlights : display mannequins which look terri@@ bly human thanks to video projections .
they wear the spectacular creations of the French designer , who , among other things , became the big star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits - and that he put men in skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can no longer say that I have the en@@ f@@ ant terrible hau@@ te cou@@ ture , because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was ble@@ ak , now it is real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for visitors to the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From Bürger@@ stei@@ g auf den Lauf@@ ste@@ g ) , which is to be seen at the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung from the 18th of September at the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is a good fortune that the designer changed his attitude towards a show about his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , he was against it , because : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me an exhibition sounded a bit of death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you come to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously been done in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about as much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ ders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the barely visible work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed any training .
the show is not chron@@ ological , but it is an excell@@ ently choreograph@@ ed Gesamt@@ kunst@@ werk , for which a lot of effort was done : to fr@@ o the dolls , for example , a sty@@ list was engaged .
according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , the makers have gone to Munich for 14 tonnes of material .
just before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was a special treat : a leather trousers outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a little different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ tiers age Ted@@ dy can be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , highly fashionable interpretation of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he put on his ted@@ dy bear and clothes , Gau@@ l@@ tier said .
his parents would not have allowed him to play with a doll .
he later taught himself the designing of fashion .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , like Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich .
later I bought them , of course .
he has not been able to pay the models for his first show of fashion .
they got nothing , but were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewels instead of Gar@@ dine - P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze as fashion niche
in the past it was about the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en about making meters .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and l@@ aces were created in large quantities for customers who , for example , processed them for blankets and she@@ ers .
this is no longer working today , says Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the P@@ lau@@ en P@@ lau@@ en .
instead , fashion is again important again .
in the early times of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze Mode played a major role , was then displaced by the Heim@@ tex@@ ti@@ lindustrie - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : lace in jewelry , accessories like bags and in regional costumes .
in general , the so @-@ called vintage fashion bor@@ rowed from past styles is an increasing order potential .
anyone who doesn &apos;t serve niche in the textile sector in Germany is no longer on the market .
with us they already make half of all orders .
cran@@ berry P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the industry association P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze and Sti@@ cker@@ eien , together with nine other companies .
only they are allowed to bear the protected label .
over the past 15 years , around 80 percent of sales have been broken .
private specialist shops and the wholesale trade are almost no longer available .
our products are barely able to reach the customer in this way .
nowadays , mass @-@ produced goods are produced much cheaper in the Asian region and are sold almost exclusively via chains .
in addition , exports are weaker , up to date in Russia and the US .
so there are enough reasons for new ways .
the industry association also tries to score points through environmental awareness , as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer explains from the embroi@@ dery mill in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; this year we have been running a quality seal , which shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially acceptable . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also refers to the materials used . &quot;
graduate designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ e@@ berger branch of the West@@ säch@@ sische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and specializes in embroi@@ der@@ ies and spi@@ kes .
in order to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and companies who have to think above all economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , an existing design is often only slightly varied in order to keep a customer base .
a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter revi@@ ved the historic snow@@ ball peak .
the machine sticks small chi@@ cks in some places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ lau@@ ener gold@@ smith &apos;s mist@@ ress &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bianca Hal@@ leb@@ ach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße took his inspiration : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously I could not do anything with the traditional P@@ lau@@ ener Tip . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .
in a complex process it shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people in the region identify with the topic of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reu@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also supplies to the USA , to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers , whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and surroundings and who want a souvenir .
with this I see my jewellery as modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie
legends shouldn &apos;t be touched , but Disney still dar@@ es to get a new movie of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it is a kind of continuation which takes 20 years after the first film with the magic child girl . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s about the experiences of N@@ anny with the B@@ anks family during the world economic crisis in England .
anyone who plays P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the director is already clear : Ro@@ b Marshall , recently with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the cinema . &quot; &quot; &quot;
XI urged to open the economy to the wider world
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy needs to open more broad@@ ly to promote growth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said President Xi Jin@@ ping on Tuesday , a group charged with the steering of reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should be committed to attract foreign investments and know @-@ how and to improve the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Executive Committee for the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
promoting new spin @-@ ups and driving reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality , and new place for economic growth , &quot; says Xi .
the leadership group has adopted a series of guidelines , including a negative list to regulate market access , relaxation of border control policies , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the population reporting system .
according to the statement , a negative list is created that identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment .
the system is tested gradually and improved by test programs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is of importance as it as@@ signs the market a greater role in allocation of resources , guaranteeing a right @-@ wing business environment and making the market more open , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also lo@@ osen control over the powers transferred to companies and ensure companies decide how they manage their business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the statement also said that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as part of an offer to open a state @-@ controlled sector , further areas for private investment are opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded businesses and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the Green Card by optim@@ ising the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process .
the right of the lawyers to guarantee their activity , and to employ professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting .
in the meeting Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated , as announced in a declaration announced after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury border value in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish
the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish and to allow consumers to take a significantly higher dose of the pesti@@ cide .
the consumer organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , having received a corresponding EU working paper , sharply critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of mis@@ leading industrial and environmental policies are passed on with full impact on pregnant women and infants , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch .
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limits of the nerve centre for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as sh@@ arks or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish , should be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram of fish .
however , large pre@@ dat@@ ory fishes are already so heavily poll@@ uted with mercury , that around 50 percent of the cat@@ ches may not be sold on the basis of the still valid limit values .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be irre@@ voc@@ able .
in exchange for this sl@@ ack@@ ening , the EU wants to tigh@@ ten the limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but F@@ ood@@ watch described this as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trick &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because smaller c@@ emet@@ eries such as car@@ p are usually so low @-@ bur@@ dened to keep the planned maximum values already today . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the reduction in Kl@@ on@@ ef@@ ish is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ al defl@@ ection maneu@@ ver that alone helps the economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal that is highly po@@ ison@@ ous to humans , which mainly accum@@ ulates in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish through the food chain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government therefore warns against the fact that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already small amounts can cause damage to the nervous system particularly in the case of un@@ born damage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Environment Ministry explains on its homepage with regard to the valid maximum values , however , that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health endanger@@ ment of the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is mainly due to coal combustion in the environment .
according to a written information from the Federal Ministry of Environment , German coal @-@ fired power plants colli@@ de more than six tonnes of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total volume issued in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish , for instance in Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permanently and nationwide sur@@ passed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had quoted the Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from paper in March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past year , Europe @-@ wide warnings of mercury in fish have already counted among the most common health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
