in order to enrich the target established in Article 28 , material accounting is used as a preventive measure of fundamental importance , combined with spatial confin@@ ement and observation as important supplementary measures .
the technical conclusion of the tests carried out by the organization is made by an explanation in which the quantity of material which is not proven for a certain period of time is specified under specification of the accuracy limits for the given me@@ gen .
when performing their follow @-@ up examinations , the Organization shall make full use of the community &apos;s backup system in accordance with Article 3 .
the accounting and control system of the Community for Nu@@ clear Materials pursuant to this Convention is based on an outline in material balance zones .
in applying their security measures , the Community shall make use of the procedures and measures of the following kind and , as far as necessary , envis@@ age how they are intended in the supplementary agreements and are expe@@ dient :
a ) a measurement system to determine the quantities of goods produced , sent , lost , lost or otherwise from the stock of removed core material and the amount of stock ;
B ) the evaluation of reproduci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and estim@@ ation of measurement uncertainty ;
C ) procedures for determining , evaluating and evaluating differences in the measurements of sender and recipient ;
e ) procedures for ass@@ essing the accumulation of un@@ measured invent@@ ories and non @-@ measured losses ;
F ) a protocol and reporting system that indicates the core material inventory and the changes in the material balance zone for each material balance zone , including the inputs and outputs of the material balance zone ;
g ) Pre@@ ferences which ensure that accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) Proced@@ ures to reimbur@@ se reports to the organization in accordance with Articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the securing measures according to this agreement are not restricted to material in mining or ore processing .
B ) If Uran@@ ium or th@@ ori@@ um@@ ous material , which has not yet reached the phase of the core fuel cycle described in letter c ) , is introduced into the States , the association of the organization shares the quantity and composition of the material unless it is introduced for specifically non @-@ nuclear purposes ;
C ) relies on core material , which is suitable for the composition and purity of the fuel production or the is@@ ot@@ op@@ ark enrich@@ ment , the plant or the process phase in which it is produced , or if this core material or other , in a later phase of the core fuel cycle established core material is introduced into the states , then it is subject to the other security measures mentioned in this agreement .
a ) The securing measures envis@@ aged in this agreement are terminated for core material under the conditions mentioned in Article 11 . if the provisions mentioned in Article 11 are not fulfilled , the Community is temporarily not possible or desired to recover from residues , the organization and the community consult each other on the application of suitable securing measures .
B ) The security measures envis@@ aged in this Convention are terminated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 13 , provided that the organization and the community agree that this core material is practically non @-@ ref@@ und@@ able .
at the request of the Community , the organisation fre@@ es the following core material from the security measures in accordance with this Convention :
a ) special fis@@ sile material when used in gram@@ - or smaller amounts as a sensor in instruments ;
B ) Nu@@ clear material if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities in accordance with Article 13 , if such core material is re@@ cover@@ able , and
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 , which lies above 80 % .
at the request of the Community , the organization &apos;s core material , which would otherwise be subject to security measures according to this agreement , exemp@@ t from these safegu@@ ards insofar as the total material quantity delivered in the states is at no point at any point at any time .
a ) a total of one kilogram of special foldable material , which can consist of one or more of the following materials :
II ) ur@@ an@@ ium with an enrich@@ ment of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multi@@ pl@@ ying its weight with enrich@@ ment ,
III ) ur@@ an@@ ium with an enrich@@ ment , which lies below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above that of Natur@@ uria , is calculated by multi@@ pl@@ ying its weight with the five @-@ fold square of enrich@@ ment ;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ an@@ ium and depl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with an enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) twenty metric tons of depl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with an enrich@@ ment of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
if freed core material is to be processed or stored together with core material , which is subject to the security measures pursuant to this Convention , precau@@ tions are made for the re @-@ application of the securing measures to that material .
the Community meets with the Organisation suppl@@ em@@ ental agreements , which are necessary for the successful and effective provision of the tasks of the Organization according to this Convention , in the individual determine how to apply the procedures specified in the Convention .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the supplementary agreements can be extended or changed without changing the agreement in agreement between the organization and the community . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the supplementary agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention into force . the organization , the Community and the States undertake every effort to allow these agreements to enter into force within nin@@ ety days after the entry into force of this Convention ; an extension of this period requires the agreement between the organization , the community and the states .
based on the initial report stated in Article 62 of the initial report , the organisation establishes a summar@@ ised inventory of the whole , the security measures of this agreement in the States , regardless of its origin , and continues to carry out this inventory due to the subsequent reports and the results of their investigations .
between the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Federal Republic of Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation ( Organisation ) on the other
the EW@@ G has decided to contribute to the special action programme prescribed at the conference for international economic cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income , whose development is imp@@ eded by general resource cent@@ age problems .
C ) The objective of the EEC and Member States is that the entire contribution provided by the Member States within six months after entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years after entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal .
D ) The EEC and the Organization have consul@@ ted each other on the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the middle ties in order to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
for this purpose , the organization of the EEC has presented a table showing how it intends to apply the criteria specified in this agreement -
the organization establishes a special account under the name &quot; Special Ac@@ credi@@ tation Account &quot; which consists of funds made by the Member States in accordance with this agreement to the special interaction account ; this account is governed by the organization as a ste@@ ward and used ( in this capacity , the organization is referred to as &quot; Man@@ age &quot; ) , only for the purpose specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement .
the special interaction account is kept separate from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
the fees are to be paid as follows : a ) Payment shall be made in the form of cash or non @-@ interest debit notes of the Member State , which are to be paid in the currency of the respective State at Order of the Organization as the administrator of the special transaction account and to be deposited at the organization of the organization in the country concerned .
B ) The payment shall be made in two install@@ ments ( i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the fee within 30 days after entry into force of this Agreement or any other time agreed between the EEC and the car@@ et@@ aker ;
II ) the second in the amount of the remaining amount of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at any other time agreed between the EEC and the custo@@ dian , taking into account the dead@@ lines required for parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans .
C ) Each Member State may , upon request , make payments in advance of the aforementioned dates .
according to the usual procedures of the organization , the car@@ et@@ aker takes about proportional representation on the cash or the deb@@ enture in order to cover the expenses for the special transaction loan and to balance the special transaction account in an appropriate manner .
under the warranty of these loans , the administrator can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the terms of the EEC :
III ) the extent to which international economic factors contributed to the current and fores@@ eeable economic problems of the country ;
VI ) the composition and the trend of the country &apos;s debt service and its further lending capacity to loan conditions without conc@@ essions ; and
VII ) the extent to which the problems of the countries concerned can be regulated by contributions from other sources .
each Lo@@ an Lo@@ an is used to finance a clearly defined and quickly paid development programme or project ( including a sec@@ toral plan ) , irrespective of whether it is part of the organisation &apos;s loan programme or not , according to the procedures and practices that are considered , approved and managed by the ordinary funds of the organization .
the means of the special transaction account must not be used in place of the International Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organization , which is bound by the Bank &apos;s directors or the organization on the day of the entry into force of this agreement .
apart from section 4 , special transaction loans are subject to the same deposit conditions which apply to the development loan granted by the organization in general ; they are therefore re@@ payable in the last 50 years in ten years .
special transactions loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are ref@@ und@@ able in these currencies .
amounts for payment of this watch are to be made directly to the organization that retains it .
each Lo@@ an Lo@@ an is determined by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the car@@ et@@ aker , in particular the origin of the funds is stated .
the income from each Lo@@ an Lo@@ an can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services manufactured ( i ) in a Member State ; ii ) in developing countries which are members of the organization and who , in accordance with what the administrator has set at the time of loan guarantee , may be the recipient of a special transaction loan .
capital re@@ payments of a special transaction loan are made to the special transaction account , and the amount paid back in this way in the currency of a member state shall be transferred back as soon as possible by the administrator to the respective Member State .
the supervis@@ or teaches the EEC concerning the projects and programmes approved by the directors to be fully paid by the directors in preparation and on the projects and programmes approved by the directors .
during the time of the payment of the special Lo@@ an Lo@@ an , the Managing Director teaches the EW@@ G four times a year on the development of the special transaction loan and the expenses made for this .
the administrator transfers the EEC as soon as possible after conclusion of the financial year of the organization a detailed account of the special action account with a statement from the external audi@@ tor of the organization to this account statement .
after full payment of the special transaction loan , the administrator of the EEC soon transfers a detailed report on the plans and programs financed by the special transaction account .
the administrator creates and performs appropriate records and billing , from which the contributions to the special interaction account , which are made from the accounts payable and deduc@@ ted from the account paid amounts and the withdraw@@ als to the Member States .
the EEC and the car@@ et@@ akers work closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement .
to this end , the EEC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the car@@ et@@ aker up to the full edition of the means of the special ac@@ tional account from time to time will give an exchange of ideas about the state of the special transaction account , the progress of programmes or projects financed by special transactions and on all other issues related to the provisions of this agreement .
if this agreement has not come into force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date , which the EEC and the Organisation have agreed , the agreement and all obligations of the parties shall be due immediately .
if the total capital amount of all payments eligible by the bene@@ fici@@ aries is returned to the Member States in accordance with Article II Section 8 of the agreement , this agreement and all obligations of the parties shall be terminated with immediate effect .
this agreement requires approval by the Member States and the EEC in accordance with the proced@@ ural regulations of each party .
the governments of the Member States are noti@@ fying the Sec@@ retariat of the Council of the European Communities the conclusion of the proceedings concerned .
the Sec@@ retariat for@@ wards these noti@@ fications along with a Noti@@ fication on the regular approval of this Agreement by the EEC to the Organization .
this agreement becomes effective and occurs in force on the first day of the month following the day of receipt of the aforementioned notification in the organization .

I honor you to confirm the receipt of your letter with the following wording :
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would confirm the consent of your government to the above . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
agreement in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements on the mobili@@ zation of the demands of the Member States within the medium term financial support
the BI@@ S could include stand@@ by loan agreements with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries if the banks issue a corresponding application .
the agreements could be concluded by the total amount of the contribution paid by the credi@@ tor land to the mechanism paid by the credi@@ tor , within a total limit of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion of accounting units ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future pro@@ visi@@ oning funds of the member countries .
however , some conditions are already mentioned below , for whose application the BI@@ S would be ready .
with each stand@@ by loan the BI@@ S would first assume an obligation for two years , whereby the possibility of extensions stands out , but a total of five years will be exceeded .
when the loan was opened as well as its possible extension , the BI@@ S would charge a credit opening commission .
in addition , it would be agreed that the first drawings should not be made before the end of one month after termination of the stand @-@ by agreement so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity .
the drawing dies would take place in the currencies available to the BI@@ S at the end of the agreement , very likely in US dollars ; they would extend for periods that were to be negotiated under consideration of the funds provided by the Bank , presumably three or six months .
the conditions would correspond to those transactions carried out by the BI@@ S at the respective time on under similar conditions , i.e. interest rates would correspond largely to market rates .
however , if BI@@ S has to obtain the necessary means on the market itself , the interest rate applicable to the application could reach a maximum corresponding to the corresponding margin raised .
I would be grateful if you would share with me the approval of the Council of the European Communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BI@@ S could close stand@@ by loan agreements with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries if the banks issue a corresponding application . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would give me the consent of the Council of the European Communities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I encourage you to share with you the consent of the Council of the European Communities to the content of this letter .

following the entry into force of the Convention , the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe can invite any non @-@ member state to join the Convention .
the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe noti@@ fies the members of the Council and the accompanying States a ) the time of the entry into force of the Convention and the names of the members who have signed or rati@@ fied it without reservation of rati@@ fication or approval ;
any contracting party may termin@@ ate this agreement with notification to the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe in compliance with a deadline of one year .
a re@@ agent for blood group determination must react with all tested blood samples containing the an@@ tigen which is hom@@ olog@@ ous to the antibody or another substance indicated on the label .
if a re@@ agent is used in the manner recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena may not occur : a ) mol@@ y@@ tic properties ;
the ti@@ ter is measured twice in a suitable medium by di@@ lution of the re@@ agent to be examined .
the ti@@ ter is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of strongest ser@@ um di@@ lution where a reaction occurs ; di@@ lution is calculated solely by volume of the blood cell in@@ undation in the total volume .
in the case of anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents that are to be used on object carriers , the activity is expressed by the time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier .
the World Health Organisation has established international standards for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B agents , as well as complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents for blood group determination , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity are elabor@@ ated at the time standards .
an International standard preparation contains , according to definition , a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the ti@@ ters observed in individual preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group determination of most speci@@ fi@@ cities is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ ary , which is observed in a series of di@@ lu@@ tions in er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ te in@@ undation .
the ti@@ tre den@@ otes the di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the last mix within a series where a micro@@ scopic visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
the effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group determination , for which international standard preparations are present ( currently anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as complete anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of the ti@@ tr@@ ation of the unknown re@@ agent in comparison to the International Standard Prepar@@ ation or a State Standard Prepar@@ ation in International Units ( See bul@@ letin , WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 301 ) .
if you bring it back to a volume of 1 ml , the anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B juices contain according to definition 256 international units per ml .
the preparations are available free of charge from the International Dental Laboratory of the World Health Organization , Stat@@ ens ser@@ um Institut , Copenhagen .
the following table shows an example of a comparative ti@@ tr@@ ation of the International Standard ser@@ um Anti @-@ A ( S ) and an &quot; unknown &quot; anti @-@ A re@@ agent ( U ) against red blood cells A1 and red blood cells A@@ 2B . &gt; P@@ IC FI@@ LE = &quot; T@@ 00@@ 4@@ 50@@ 83 &quot; &gt;
if a re@@ agent is stored in the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its required properties shall remain intact for at least one year .
the exp@@ iry date of a re@@ agent in liquid form according to the label is at most one year after the last satisfactory efficacy test .
the exp@@ iry date indicated on the label for dry re@@ agents is based on the results of the re@@ tain@@ ability tests ; it is approved by the state supervisory authorities .
dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container in which they have been dried and which is closed so that no moisture can penetrate .
a dry re@@ agent may lose only 0.5 per cent of its weight if it is tested by further drying via phosph@@ or@@ us oxi@@ des at a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg in 24 hours .
in order to avoid bacterial growth , the competent state authority can determine that the re@@ agent ( or solvents supplied with the dry re@@ agents ) is added to an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic , provided that the re@@ agent with the added substance continues to have the requirements of specific@@ ity and effectiveness .
sera human origin for blood group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg of protein nitrogen per ml of liquid or re @-@ dissolved ser@@ um .
the re@@ agents , whether in fluid form or after replacement , must be transparent and must neither contain sedi@@ ments nor yellow or visible particles .
the re@@ agents destined for the international exchange of blood group determination should not be coloured arti@@ fici@@ ally as long as possible , at least until an international agreement has reached a uniform system .
re@@ agents for blood group determination are to be distributed in such a way and in such quantities that the re@@ agent in a container is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to perform tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the quantity in a container must be so large that the content may possibly be used to carry out the effectiveness tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturer &apos;s laboratory has written records of all stages of production and checks of re@@ agents for blood group determination .
adequate samples of all re@@ agents are to be kept from the laboratory until it can be assumed that the batch is no longer used .
re@@ agents used for blood group determination can contain substances of human , animal , vegetable ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective portion , the others are the necessary aids to strengthen the effectiveness and maintain the stability of the re@@ agent .
for technical reasons these re@@ agents are classified according to the origin of their effective interest in three groups .
this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain purely substances of human origin , or that animal or herbal re@@ agents cannot contain substances of human origin .
on each box , a black printed label is available in English and French , containing the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
4. the quantity or , in the case of dried re@@ agents , the quantity and composition of the liquid required for re @-@ dissolution ,
furthermore , this label or label on the box in which the individual containers are located , or the instructions attached to the containers contain the following information : 1 . full name and address of the manufacturer ,
3. the quantity or , in the case of dried re@@ agents , the quantity and composition of the liquid required for re @-@ dissolution ,
each shipment shall be enclosed in accordance with Article 4 of the Convention in accordance with the Annex to this Protocol .

it ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ates human red blood cells that contain the A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ o ) an@@ tigen ( which in general are not ag@@ glut@@ ined by anti @-@ A ser@@ um of blood don@@ ors of the group B ) .
an anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) ser@@ um is parallel to the un@@ dil@@ uted , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood group ser@@ um or a corresponding equivalent , separated from the inc@@ ess@@ ation of A1 and A2 blood cells .
furthermore , it is parallel to the un@@ dil@@ uted , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group ser@@ um or a corresponding equivalent remedy against the in@@ undation of B @-@ blood cells .
the effectiveness of the ser@@ um may not be less than 64 international units per ml .
un@@ dil@@ uted anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) blood ser@@ um must also cause an easily recognizable ag@@ glut@@ ination of the blood cells of the A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ o ) blood cells .
if an anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) ser@@ um is mixed on an object carrier with equal amounts of 5@@ - to 10 percent floo@@ ding of A1 and A2 blood cells , the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within twice the time required if the same tests are performed with the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood group ser@@ um or with a standard preparation of the same activity .

anti @-@ R@@ h blood group sera of each specific@@ ity can belong to one of two species , which are distinguished by the conditions under which ag@@ glut@@ ination of hom@@ olog@@ ous blood cells is achieved .
with others , which are referred to as &quot; in@@ completely , &quot; ag@@ glut@@ ination can only be achieved in the presence of certain col@@ lo@@ ids such as beef cal@@ um@@ ine or with the help of other special methods .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incomplete &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ser@@ a ag@@ glut@@ inate on object carriers even hom@@ olog@@ ous red blood cells , which are washed up in their own ser@@ um or plasma . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the following requirements for effectiveness of Ser@@ a to determine the R@@ h group may possibly change if International standard preparations are available ( i ) anti @-@ D ( anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) blood group ser@@ um ( human )
anti @-@ D ser@@ um is obtained from the blood of one or more persons , which are immun@@ ised by the an@@ tigen D of the R@@ h system .
it re@@ acts with human red blood cells containing the tigen D but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the an@@ tigen D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; complete &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ D Ser@@ a must have a ti@@ tre of at least 1 : 32 compared to C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells in a 0.@@ 9 percent sal@@ ine solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
