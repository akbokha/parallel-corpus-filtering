<seg id="728">Based on the initial report stated in Article 62 of the initial report, the organisation establishes a summarised inventory of the whole, the security measures of this agreement in the States, regardless of its origin, and continues to carry out this inventory due to the subsequent reports and the results of their investigations.</seg>
<seg id="729">Between the European Economic Community (EEC) and its Member States Belgium, Denmark, Federal Republic of Germany, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, United Kingdom (Member States) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation (Organisation) on the other</seg>
<seg id="730">The EWG has decided to contribute to the special action programme prescribed at the conference for international economic cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income, whose development is impeded by general resource centage problems.</seg>
<seg id="731">C) The objective of the EEC and Member States is that the entire contribution provided by the Member States within six months after entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years after entry into force in the form of loans, and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal.</seg>
<seg id="732">D) The EEC and the Organization have consulted each other on the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the middle ties in order to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="733">For this purpose, the organization of the EEC has presented a table showing how it intends to apply the criteria specified in this agreement -</seg>
<seg id="734">The organization establishes a special account under the name "Special Accreditation Account" which consists of funds made by the Member States in accordance with this agreement to the special interaction account; this account is governed by the organization as a steward and used (in this capacity, the organization is referred to as "Manage"), only for the purpose specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="735">The special interaction account is kept separate from all other accounts and assets of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="736">The fees are to be paid as follows: a) Payment shall be made in the form of cash or non-interest debit notes of the Member State, which are to be paid in the currency of the respective State at Order of the Organization as the administrator of the special transaction account and to be deposited at the organization of the organization in the country concerned.</seg>

<seg id="739">C) Each Member State may, upon request, make payments in advance of the aforementioned dates.</seg>
<seg id="740">According to the usual procedures of the organization, the caretaker takes about proportional representation on the cash or the debenture in order to cover the expenses for the special transaction loan and to balance the special transaction account in an appropriate manner.</seg>
<seg id="741">Under the warranty of these loans, the administrator can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the terms of the EEC:</seg>
<seg id="742">III) the extent to which international economic factors contributed to the current and foreseeable economic problems of the country;</seg>
<seg id="743">VI) the composition and the trend of the country's debt service and its further lending capacity to loan conditions without concessions; and</seg>
<seg id="744">VII) the extent to which the problems of the countries concerned can be regulated by contributions from other sources.</seg>
<seg id="745">Each Loan Loan is used to finance a clearly defined and quickly paid development programme or project (including a sectoral plan), irrespective of whether it is part of the organisation's loan programme or not, according to the procedures and practices that are considered, approved and managed by the ordinary funds of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="746">The means of the special transaction account must not be used in place of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (Bank) or the Organization, which is bound by the Bank's directors or the organization on the day of the entry into force of this agreement.</seg>

<seg id="749">Amounts for payment of this watch are to be made directly to the organization that retains it.</seg>
<seg id="750">Each Loan Loan is determined by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the caretaker, in particular the origin of the funds is stated.</seg>
<seg id="751">The income from each Loan Loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services manufactured (i) in a Member State; ii) in developing countries which are members of the organization and who, in accordance with what the administrator has set at the time of loan guarantee, may be the recipient of a special transaction loan.</seg>
<seg id="752">Capital repayments of a special transaction loan are made to the special transaction account, and the amount paid back in this way in the currency of a member state shall be transferred back as soon as possible by the administrator to the respective Member State.</seg>
<seg id="753">The supervisor teaches the EEC concerning the projects and programmes approved by the directors to be fully paid by the directors in preparation and on the projects and programmes approved by the directors.</seg>
<seg id="754">During the time of the payment of the special Loan Loan, the Managing Director teaches the EWG four times a year on the development of the special transaction loan and the expenses made for this.</seg>
<seg id="755">The administrator transfers the EEC as soon as possible after conclusion of the financial year of the organization a detailed account of the special action account with a statement from the external auditor of the organization to this account statement.</seg>
<seg id="756">After full payment of the special transaction loan, the administrator of the EEC soon transfers a detailed report on the plans and programs financed by the special transaction account.</seg>
<seg id="757">The administrator creates and performs appropriate records and billing, from which the contributions to the special interaction account, which are made from the accounts payable and deducted from the account paid amounts and the withdrawals to the Member States.</seg>
<seg id="758">The EEC and the caretakers work closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="759">To this end, the EEC (represented by the Commission of the European Communities) and the caretaker up to the full edition of the means of the special actional account from time to time will give an exchange of ideas about the state of the special transaction account, the progress of programmes or projects financed by special transactions and on all other issues related to the provisions of this agreement.</seg>
