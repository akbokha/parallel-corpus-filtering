this document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) has evaluated the trials carried out in order to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine .
if you need more information about your illness or treatment , please read the package description ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .

it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of fusion tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution for taking ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. Whi@@ le thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , di@@ str@@ ust and del@@ u@@ sions ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a mental disorder , in which patients have man@@ ic episodes ( periods of abnormal high @-@ altitude ) alter@@ nat@@ ely with periods of normal sen@@ timent .
A@@ bili@@ fy is used to treat medium to severe man@@ ic episodes and to prevent man@@ ic episodes in patients who have referred to the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used for quick monitoring of increased rest@@ lessness or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , if the oral intake of the drug is not possible .
in both diseases , the solution to take @-@ in or the fusion tablets can be applied in patients who are experiencing difficulty swal@@ lowing .
in patients who are taking other medicines at the same time as A@@ bili@@ fy , the dose of A@@ bili@@ fy should be adjusted .
this interfer@@ es with the transmission of signals between brain cells by neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters , i.e. chemical substances which facilitate the communication between nerve cells .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is believed to be a &quot; partial ag@@ on@@ ist &quot; for recept@@ ors for neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l is like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but to a lesser extent as the neur@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter works to activate the recept@@ ors .
since dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin contribute to schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l contributes to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , which reduces psycho@@ tic or man@@ ic symptoms and prevents their re@@ occurrence .
the efficacy of abili@@ fy to prevent recur@@ r@@ ence of symptoms has been studied in three studies lasting up to one year .
the efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 8@@ 05 patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or similar disorders that suffered from increased rest@@ lessness , over a period of two hours with a plac@@ ebo .
in another study , A@@ bili@@ fy was compared to 3@@ 47 patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy and plac@@ ebo to prevent recur@@ r@@ ence , compared to 160 patients where the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabili@@ zed with A@@ bili@@ fy .
the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study of 301 patients suffering from increased rest@@ lessness compared to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psycho@@ tic ) and plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours .
all studies examined the change in patients &apos; symptoms by means of a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients responding to treatment .
the company also carried out studies to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the melt tablets and the solution to absorb ( as@@ simil@@ ates ) .
in both studies with the injection solution , patients who received A@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg were significantly stronger than the patients receiving plac@@ ebo .
when applying for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , A@@ bili@@ fy reduced man@@ ic symptoms more effectively than plac@@ ebo in four of the five short @-@ term studies .
apart from plac@@ ebo , A@@ bili@@ fy prevented the recur@@ r@@ ence of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients for up to 74 weeks and was administered in addition to an existing treatment .
A@@ bili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses also reduced more effective than plac@@ ebo the symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of A@@ bili@@ fy ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are extra@@ pyr@@ amid@@ al disorders ( un@@ controlled access ) , T@@ rem@@ or ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , di@@ eting ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , di@@ gest@@ pation ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , nausea , vom@@ iting ( increased s@@ ali@@ vation ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the advantages of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and from moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in patients with predominantly man@@ ic episodes , and in which the man@@ ic episodes discussed the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , were predomin@@ ated against the risks .
moreover , the committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of injection solution in rapid control of increased rest@@ lessness and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes associated with bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , if oral therapy is not suitable , out@@ weigh the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd. to establish A@@ bili@@ fy in the entire European Union .
A@@ bili@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar I@@ - disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who mostly had man@@ ic episodes and whose man@@ ic episodes were related to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day , independent of meals .
increased efficacy in dos@@ ages above a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven , although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 15 mg once a day , regardless of the meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of abili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar I@@ - disorder in patients ≥ 65 years was not proven .
taking into account the greater sensitivity of this group of patients , a lower initial dose should be taken into consideration when clinical factors justify this ( see section 4.4 ) .
if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ duc@@ tor is removed from the combination therapy , the dosage should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psycho@@ tic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after beginning or after change of an anti @-@ psycho@@ tic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder there was no increased su@@ ici@@ dal risk with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to other anti @-@ psycho@@ tics .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with care in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ a@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , hyper@@ tension ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that are pre@@ dispos@@ ing for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including cel@@ eri@@ ac and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) .
3 L@@ ate dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies lasting one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
if patients treated with A@@ bili@@ fy show signs and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , consider reducing the dose or breaking treatment .
if a patient has developed signs and symptoms that indicate a M@@ NS or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of M@@ NS , all anti@@ psycho@@ tics , including A@@ bili@@ fy , must be dismissed .
therefore Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or at states associated with sei@@ zur@@ es .
56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole had an increased risk of death compared to plac@@ ebo .
however , there was in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between dosage and response to un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti @-@ psycho@@ tic drugs , including A@@ bili@@ fy .
there are no precise risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ related adverse events associated with A@@ bili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti @-@ psycho@@ tic drugs that allow direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ y and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in relation to wor@@ sen@@ ing glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia patients and in patients with bi@@ polar disorder due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psycho@@ tics , where weight gain is known as a side effect or un@@ healthy li@@ fest@@ y@@ les and could lead to serious complications .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution is required when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines with sei@@ z@@ ure side effects such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant .
in a clinical study with healthy volunteers , a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ din ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l by 107 % , while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made .
in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &quot; ) Met@@ aboli@@ zers , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 Exten@@ sive Met@@ aboli@@ zers .
considering the joint application of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ hibit@@ ors with A@@ bili@@ fy , potential benefits should weigh the potential risks for the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ ors , are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be undertaken .
after sett@@ ling the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 In@@ hibit@@ or , the dosage of A@@ bili@@ fy should be raised to the dose level prior to the beginning of the accompanying therapy .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with A@@ bili@@ fy can be administered with a moderate increase in the concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
in clinical trials , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the medi@@ ums of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ met@@ morph@@ ine / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ ine R@@ atio ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( War@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ met@@ h ) .
the patients should be advised to inform their doctor if they are pregnant or plan pregnancy during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
this drug may not be used during pregnancy as a result of insufficient data security for humans and due to the concerns created in animal reproduction studies , unless the potential benefit justi@@ fies the potential risk for the fet@@ us .
however , as with other anti @-@ psycho@@ tics , patients should be warned that dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , should be operated until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l has no negative influence on them .
the following adverse events occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of adverse events listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a total lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ onia and dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , compared to patients treated with Hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under plac@@ ebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study for 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lanz@@ ap@@ in therapy .
in a controlled study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 23@@ ,5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients under semi @-@ operi@@ dol treatment .
in another study for 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 26.@@ 6 % in patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase for over 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS was 18.@@ 2 % for patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Plac@@ ebo , where potential clin@@ ically significant changes in the rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , did not reveal any medi@@ cally significant differences .
enh@@ ancements of CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
the side effects reported in connection with an anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy are the mal@@ ig@@ ne neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or inten@@ tional over@@ dos@@ ages with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were observed alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death sequence .
although there is no information about the efficacy of a hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , it is unlikely that hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis is useful in the treatment of over@@ dose because Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l has a high plasma protein binding .
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated on the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a @-@ recept@@ ors .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed in vitro a high aff@@ inity for the dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 @-@ receptor and the ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 and 5@@ HT@@ 2a receptor as well as a moderate aff@@ inity for dop@@ amine D@@ 4@@ - , for ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and to the hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ receptor .
the posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction in the binding of 11@@ C rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 receptor lig@@ ands , a D2 / D3 receptor lig@@ ands , at the nucle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and at the coup .
in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) in 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psycho@@ tic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo .
in a half @-@ operation @-@ controlled study , 52 percent of respon@@ dents , who were referring to the study medication , were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % and Hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from meas@@ ur@@ als defined as secondary study objectives , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - depression rate scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than at Hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study for 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a significantly higher reduction in the return rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l group and 57 % in plac@@ ebo .
in an O@@ lanz@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was , a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg ) with an average weight of ca .
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage for 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a efficacy compared to plac@@ ebo in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study for 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy compared to plac@@ ebo .
in two plac@@ ebo@@ - and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies for 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psycho@@ tic characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a efficacy compared to plac@@ ebo in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol in week 12 .
also in week 12 , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a comparable proportion of patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia such as lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study for 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psycho@@ tic features , which sometimes did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic ser@@ um mirrors , es@@ cor@@ t therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate .
10 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study for 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension phase for 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole prior to random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed himself superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar rel@@ ap@@ se , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia .
based on in vitro studies , the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ treatment of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , the N @-@ de@@ al@@ k@@ yl@@ ation is cataly@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the mean elimination period is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l with extensive metabolism via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and approximately 146 hours in &apos; poor &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) met@@ abo@@ lics using C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy volunteers , as well as in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients showed no gender @-@ dependent effects .
a simulation @-@ specific evaluation of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics did not reveal any clin@@ ically significant differences with respect to ethnic origin or the impact of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency compared to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study of subjects with different liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the impairment of liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , but the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
based on conventional research on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproduction toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data did not identify any particular dangers to humans .
toxic@@ ological significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or exposure , which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans , so they have limited or no meaning for the clinical application .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 3 to 10 times the mean Ste@@ ady State exposition ( AU@@ C ) at 60 mg / kg / day ( 10@@ times the average steady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose for humans ) .
in addition , ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was established as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the average steady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ times the recommended maximum dose for humans based on mg / m2 ) .
however , the concentrations of the sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates of Hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l found in the human bile at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg were no more than 6 % of the concentrations found in the study for over 39 weeks in the g@@ all of monkeys and lie far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of the in vitro solu@@ bility .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages leading to 3 and 11 times the middle ste@@ ady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

15 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies lasting one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia encountered during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated on the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a @-@ recept@@ ors .

the recommended starting dose for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day , regardless of meals .
patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing A@@ bili@@ fy tablets can use the melting tablets alternatively to A@@ bili@@ fy tablets ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psycho@@ tic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders were reported in some cases after beginning or after change of an anti @-@ psycho@@ tic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .

it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated on the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a @-@ recept@@ ors .

A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution is used for quick control of det@@ achment and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar I disorder when oral therapy is not appropriate .
as soon as it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment should be terminated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution and started with oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
to increase res@@ or@@ ption and minimize vari@@ ability , an injection into the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended using adi@@ p@@ ous regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) may be given depending on the individual clinical status taking into account the medicines used for maintenance or ac@@ utely therapy ( see section 4.5 ) .
if a further oral treatment is indicated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , see the summary of the characteristics of the medicine to A@@ bili@@ fy Tablets , A@@ bili@@ fy Mel@@ ting tablets or A@@ bili@@ fy solution for taking .
there are no tests on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution in patients with det@@ achment and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders caused by schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
if a par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ins is considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution , patients should be observed regarding extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure drop ( see section 4.5 ) .
tests on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution are not available for patients suffering from alcohol or drug toxic@@ ity ( prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with care in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ a@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , hyper@@ tension ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that are pre@@ dispos@@ ing for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including cel@@ eri@@ ac and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) .

clinical manifestations of a M@@ NS are high fever , stiff@@ ness , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ) .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ y and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in relation to wor@@ sen@@ ing glucose levels .
weight gain is generally seen in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia patients and patients with bi@@ polar disorder due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psycho@@ tics , where weight gain is known as a side effect or un@@ healthy li@@ fest@@ y@@ les and could lead to serious complications .
nevertheless , the intensity of the se@@ dation was greater compared to that of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , in a study where healthy volunteers Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( 15 mg dose ) were in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cul@@ arly administered and who at the same time received Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cul@@ arly .
105 The h@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant .
in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = poor &apos; ) Met@@ aboli@@ tion@@ ers the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ ors , are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar doses should be made .

the frequency of adverse events listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
the following adverse events occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) in clinical trials ( see section 5.1 ) :
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under plac@@ ebo .
in another study for 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase for over 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS was 18.@@ 2 % for patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Plac@@ ebo , where potential clin@@ ically significant changes in the rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , did not reveal any medi@@ cally significant differences .
enh@@ ancements of CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
the side effects reported in connection with an anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy are the mal@@ ig@@ ne neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders were the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution with statisti@@ cally significant larger improvements of a@@ gi@@ tis@@ ation / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders associated with plac@@ ebo and was similar to Hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term study ( 24 h ) with 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as a@@ gi@@ tis@@ ation and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in symptoms regarding the A@@ gi@@ tis@@ ation and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to plac@@ ebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm .
the average improvement of the initial score on the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score for the primary 2 @-@ hour end@@ point was 5.@@ 8 for plac@@ ebo , 9.@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe a@@ gi@@ ti@@ ghtness , a similar effectiveness was observed in relation to the overall population , but a statistical significance could be determined on account of a decreased patient number .
in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) in 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psycho@@ tic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo .
in a half @-@ operation @-@ controlled study , 52 percent of respon@@ dents , who were referring to the study medication , were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % ( oral ) and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from meas@@ ur@@ als defined as secondary study objectives , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg depression rate scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than at Hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study for 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) showed a significantly higher reduction in the return rate of 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % in plac@@ ebo .
in an O@@ lanz@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was , a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg ) with an average weight of ca .
111 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study for 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psycho@@ tic features , which in some cases did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic ser@@ um mirrors , es@@ cor@@ t therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study for 26 weeks followed by a 74 week study extension in man@@ ic patients who achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a superior reg@@ ression regarding the prevention of a bi@@ polar rel@@ ap@@ se , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia .
in the first 2 hours after in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular injection , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole AU@@ C is 90 % larger than the AU@@ C after administration of the same dose as a tablet ; systemic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies with healthy volunteers , the mean time until reaching the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application .
the application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution was well tolerated by rats and monkeys and did not result in any direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated administration during systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) which were in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cul@@ arly 15@@ - or 5 times higher than the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
in studies on the reproductive toxic@@ ity after IV application no safety @-@ related concerns were reported after mat@@ ernal exposure , which was 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 @-@ times ( rab@@ bits ) above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
based on conventional studies using Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) for safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproduction toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data did not identify any particular dangers to humans .
toxic@@ ological significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or exposure , which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans ; thus , they have only limited or no meaning for the clinical application .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( corresponds to 3 to 10 times the mean steady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose for humans ) and an increase of adren@@ al @-@ steady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at 60 mg / kg / day ( 10 times the mean steady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose for humans ) .
in addition , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was established as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the g@@ all of monkeys after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the mean steady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or 16@@ - to 81 times the recommended maximum dose for humans based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages leading to 3 and 11 times of the mean steady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was examined in a major study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters of earlier had received an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in any given gift or mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with a conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing medication ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce the side effects ) .
overall , in the main study 72 ( 31 % ) of 2@@ 29 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane were treated to treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients using conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
only patients who were treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer were treated with regard to the efficacy indicators such as time to wor@@ sen@@ ing the disease and survival did not make any difference between the drugs .
on the other hand , patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
it may also not be used in patients who have low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils in the blood prior to the treatment .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) found that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective in patients with which the first treatment was no longer effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , and that in contrast to other pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , it must not be given with other medicines to reduce side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission granted the company Abra@@ x@@ ane Bio@@ Science Limited for the marketing of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients who have failed first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease and for which a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapy is not shown ( see also section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils of &lt; 0.@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series .
in sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy Grade 3 treatment is to be interrupted until an improvement is reached to degree 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced .
there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dosage adjustment in patients with mild to moderate impairment of liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
there were no trials with patients with impaired kidney function and there is currently no adequate data on the recommendation of dose adap@@ tations in patients with impairment of the ren@@ al function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ article formulation of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which may have significantly different pharmac@@ ological characteristics than other formulation of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see Section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be immediately removed and a sympt@@ om@@ atic treatment is initiated , and the patient must not be treated with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el again .
in patients no renewed Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated before the neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils number has increased again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the plat@@ el@@ et number has risen to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver dys@@ functions ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
while un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane in connection with car@@ dio toxic@@ ity , cardiac occur@@ ren@@ ces in the indicated patient population are not unusual , especially in patients with earlier anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease .
if nausea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rho@@ ea occur in patients after the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane , it can be treated with the usual anti @-@ eme@@ tics and con@@ sti@@ g@@ ating methods .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used in pregnant women or women in child@@ bearing age , who do not practice effective contrac@@ eption , except for the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is essential .
women in child@@ bearing age should apply a reliable contrac@@ eption method during and up to 1 month after treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
male patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane will be advised not to give birth during and up to six months after the treatment .
male patients should be advised of a sperm con@@ serving prior to the treatment , because the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility is possible through the therapy with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as fatigue ( very often ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) , which can affect the traffic air@@ ti@@ ghtness and the ability to operate machines .
the following are the most common and most important adverse events reported in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast cancer , treated with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in pi@@ vot@@ al phase III study .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most con@@ spic@@ uous hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly reversible and dose dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ a@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
in Table 1 , adverse events in combination with the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy have occurred in each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) .
occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ tate de@@ hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased cre@@ atine in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ or@@ us in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood heart disease :

pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti @-@ angi@@ ot@@ ub@@ ules substance that promotes the mer@@ ging of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ bul@@ bar and stabili@@ zes mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their dep@@ oly@@ mer@@ isation .
this stabili@@ zation leads to an in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organisation of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic membrane functions .
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in medi@@ ates the trans@@ zy@@ sis of plasma components into the endo@@ theli@@ al cells and in @-@ vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el through the endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ ce @-@ endo@@ theli@@ al transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 alb@@ umin@@ re@@ zep@@ tor and a pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation in the tumor occurs due to the alb@@ umin@@ ous protein SP@@ ARC ( sec@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two un@@ armed un@@ f@@ alli@@ ed studies and 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ised Phase III comparative study .
in one study , 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an in@@ fusion over 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multic@@ entre study was carried out in patients with metastatic breast cancer , which received a mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el every 3 weeks , either in the form of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , either in the form of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ medication ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
in the study , 64 % of patients had an impaired general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases .
14 % of patients had previously received chemotherapy , 27 % had only one adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only for metastatic disease and 19 % for metastatic disease and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The results for the overall response rate and time until progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving &gt; First @-@ Line therapy are shown below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity compared to pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy Grade 3 during therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy for the decay of bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and remains unknown .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the overall pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 were determined in clinical trials .
exposure to drugs ( AU@@ C ) increased lin@@ early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml in analog@@ y to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 Accor@@ ding to IV administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentration decreased in a multi@@ phase mode .
the medium distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 . the high distribution volume points to a far @-@ reaching ex@@ trav@@ ascular distribution and / or soft tissue connection of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study of patients with advanced solid tum@@ ours , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared to intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane with values following a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
the clearance of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher ( 43 % ) after Abra@@ x@@ ane injection , and the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers it is reported that pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is metaboli@@ zed primarily to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and to two smaller met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer , the mean value for cum@@ ulative ex@@ cre@@ tion of the unchanged active substance was 4 % of the given total dose with less than 1 % of the met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , indicating a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clearing .
however , only a few data are available for patients at the age of over 75 years because only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .
the chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and protected against light light over 8 hours .
pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic anti @-@ angi@@ ogen@@ ic drug and , as with other potentially toxic substances , should be treated with caution when handling Abra@@ x@@ ane .
using a sterile sy@@ ringe , slowly over a period of at least 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml ( 0.@@ 9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de in@@ fusion solution is inj@@ ected into a Abra@@ x@@ ane gas bottle .
after complete addition of the solution , the water bottle should rest at least 5 minutes to ensure a good wet@@ ting of the solid .
then the water bottle should be sw@@ ung slowly and carefully for at least 2 minutes and / or in@@ inver@@ ted until complete res@@ us@@ pension of the powder is done .
if precip@@ itations or sin@@ uses are visible , the water bottle must once again be inver@@ ted gently in order to achieve a complete res@@ us@@ pension before the application .

member states must ensure that the holder of the authorization for placing on the market provides medical professionals in di@@ aly@@ sis centers and retailers with the following information and materials :
• Training brochure • Sum@@ mary of the characteristics of the medicine ( technical information ) , labelling and packaging . • With clear imaging of the correct application of the product , boxes for transport are provided by the patient .
this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological medicine that has already been approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same substance ( also called &quot; reference medicines &quot; ) .
it is used in patients with normal blood glucose concentrations in the case of blood trans@@ fusion complications , in case a blood don@@ or is not possible before the procedure and a blood loss of 900 to 1,@@ 800 ml can be expected .
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make self @-@ bleeding , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein .
the injection can also be carried out by the patient or his supervis@@ or if they have received appropriate guidance .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency or in patients receiving chemotherapy , the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values should always be at the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron values of all patients must be checked before treatment to ensure there is no iron deficiency and iron supplements should be administered during the entire treatment .
in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia may be caused by er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ in@@ suffici@@ ency or that the body does not adequately respond to the body &apos;s er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of blood loss .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , enabling them to form epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared as an injection into a v@@ ein as part of a major study involving 4@@ 79 patients suffering from kidney problems caused an@@ emia , compared to reference medicines .
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected at least eight weeks of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o into a v@@ ein before they were either converted to Ab@@ se@@ amed or continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the evaluation period between weeks 25 and 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of Ab@@ se@@ amed , inj@@ ected under the skin , were studied with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o with 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy .
in the study with patients suffering from kidney problems , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values of patients who were converted to Ab@@ se@@ amed were maintained in the same degree as those who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
compared to this , the patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is a rise in blood pressure , which can occasionally cause symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , sm@@ elling mig@@ raine head@@ aches and confusion .
Ab@@ se@@ amed must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other components .
se@@ amed as inj@@ ections under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems since further studies are required to ensure that it does not trigger allergic reactions .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that for Ab@@ se@@ amed according to the regulations of the European Union , evidence has been provided that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company that produces Ab@@ se@@ amed is provided information packages for medical professionals in all Member States including information on the safety of the medicine .
in August 2007 , the European Commission granted a permit for the marketing of Ab@@ se@@ amed across the European Union to the company Medi@@ c Medic@@ ines P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co . kg .
treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of trans@@ fusion demand in adults with solid tum@@ ours , malign@@ ant lymph@@ oma or multiple my@@ el@@ oma who receive chemotherapy and in which there is a risk of trans@@ fusion due to the general condition ( e.g. cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing an@@ a@@ emia at the start of chemotherapy ) .
treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate an@@ a@@ emia ( ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6.2 - 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , if bleeding @-@ saving measures are not available or inadequate , with planned larger operative interventions , which require a large volume of blood ( 4 or more units blood for women ; 5 or more units blood in men ) .
to reduce foreign blood , Ab@@ se@@ amed can be used before a large elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic procedure in adults without a lack of iron in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications is expected .
H@@ B 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml which cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program .
hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) except for pedi@@ at@@ ric patients where the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
symptoms of an@@ emia and symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and total disease ; therefore , an assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of illness is required by the physician .
an increase in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values can occasionally be observed in a patient via or below the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration .
in view of this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be used to reach the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
if the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the durable hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa dosage is reduced by 25 % .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest permitted dose , which is required to control an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ a@@ emia symptoms .
the clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) might need higher maintenance doses than patients where initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) might need higher maintenance doses than patients where initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
starting dosage 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week using intraven@@ ous application , if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should take place in steps of at least 4 weeks ) .
symptoms of an@@ a@@ emia and symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and total disease ; therefore , the medical examination of the individual clinical course and condition of illness is required by the doctor .
in view of this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be used to reach the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used at the lowest permitted dose , which is required for controlling the symptoms .
if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value is increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the number of re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ sis by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , the dose of 150 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.@@ E. / kg once a week .
if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in increase &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the number of re@@ circul@@ ations of &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l has increased compared to the initial value , the dose should be increased to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week .
if after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.@@ E. / kg the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increased by ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the number of re@@ circul@@ ations ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l , the dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week .
if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value is increased by &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the number of re@@ circul@@ ations by &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , a response to epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be abor@@ ted .
patients with mild an@@ a@@ emia ( ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) , with which the precau@@ tionary storage of ≥ 4 blood vessels is required , should receive Ab@@ se@@ amed twice a week for 3 weeks before surgery .
iron sub@@ stitution should start as early as possible - for example a few weeks before the start of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program , so that large iron reserves are available before the Ab@@ se@@ amed therapy .
6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ E. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week for three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( Day 0 ) .
on this occasion epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be given pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ E. / kg every 10 consecutive days , on the day of surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards .
alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis via the tube of a fi@@ st@@ ula needle followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to flush the hose and ensure an adequate injection of the medicine in the circulation .
patients undergoing treatment with any er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin at er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ en@@ ia ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pl@@ asia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive a se@@ amed or other er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin ( see section 4.4 - er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ en@@ ia ) .
heart attack or stroke in a month before the treatment , unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep v@@ ein th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis ( e.g. an@@ am@@ nes@@ tically known ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lia ) .
in patients who are provided for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic procedure and who are unable to participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program , the application of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in the following pre@@ - , accompanying or underlying diseases : severe cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease , peripheral arter@@ ial disease , vascular disease of the car@@ oti@@ d or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ; in patients with recently occurred heart attack or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular event .
er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ en@@ ia ( PR@@ CA ) Very rare was reported on the occurrence of an antibody @-@ medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after months to months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin .
in patients with sudden loss of action , defined as a reduction of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ fu@@ sions , the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ yte value should be determined and the usual causes of a non @-@ contact ( iron , fol@@ lic acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , aluminium pois@@ oning , infections or inflammation , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) are examined .
if the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ yte value , taking into account an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ yte index ) , is lower ( &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 0.5 % ) , the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te and leu@@ k@@ oc@@ yte numbers are normal , and if no other cause of a real loss is found , the anti @-@ er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin antibodies are determined and an investigation of the bone mar@@ row can be considered for diagnos@@ ing a PR@@ CA .
data on immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of Ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk of an antibody @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 In patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the upper limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration recommended under section 4.2 should not be exceeded .
in clinical studies , increased mortality risk and risk for serious cardiovascular events were observed when er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ esis @-@ stimulating agents ( ES@@ A ) were given with a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of over 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical studies have showed no significant benefit attributable to the administration of epo@@ et@@ ins when the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration is increased by the concentration required to control the symptoms of an@@ emia and the prevention of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in increase should be approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month in order to minimize the risk of an increase in hyper@@ tension .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and clin@@ ically evident cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ tery disease or con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , the upper limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration recommended under section 4.2 should not be exceeded .
according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which is not yet liable to di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
tumour patients with chemotherapy should take into account a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa donation and er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin response ( patients who may need to be trans@@ acted ) for the evaluation of the therapy effectiveness of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
if the H@@ b increase is greater than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted in accordance with paragraph 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic events ( see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy @-@ related an@@ a@@ emia - dosage adjustment with the aim of keeping the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision to use re@@ combin@@ ant er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on the benefit @-@ risk assessment with the involvement of the respective patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
in patients who are fores@@ een for greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic procedure , if possible , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia is examined and treated accordingly before the start of epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy .
patients undergoing a major orthop@@ a@@ edic procedure should receive appropriate th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis pro@@ phyla@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic and vascular diseases , especially in the underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , it cannot be ruled out that in treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with an initial sh@@ og@@ lob@@ in value of &gt; 13 g / dl an increased risk of postoperative th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic / vascular events can exist .
in several controlled studies , epo@@ et@@ ine was not proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia or decrease risk of tumour progression .
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy was returned when a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was stri@@ ven .
if epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ ine dose should be adjusted to the rising ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ rit .
in vitro studies on tumor tissues there are no indications of an interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F regarding hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or prolifer@@ ation .
about th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic , vascular events such as m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial isch@@ emia , m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events ( cereb@@ ral ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge , cereb@@ ral inf@@ ar@@ ction ) , isch@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , an@@ eur@@ y@@ thro@@ mb@@ oses , and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients under er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin treatment , as well as patients under epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
the most common side effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or the deterioration of an existing hyper@@ tension .
increased incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ vas@@ cul@@ arization ( see section 4.4 and section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients under the treatment with er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ins .
regardless of er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin treatment , patients with cardiovascular disease can result in th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic and vascular complications after repeated blood donations .
the genetically determined epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ sili@@ zed and is identical with the amino acids and carbohydr@@ ate portion with the endo@@ genous human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin which was isolated from the urine of indigenous patients .
it could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulates the er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and does not affect leu@@ kop@@ ov@@ ese .
3@@ 89 patients with hem@@ ost@@ asis ( 2@@ 21 multiple my@@ el@@ oma , 144 non @-@ Ho@@ d@@ g@@ kin@@ - lymph@@ omas and 24 other hem@@ ost@@ asis ) and 3@@ 32 patients with solid tum@@ ours ( 172 breast cancer , 64 g@@ yn@@ a@@ ecological tum@@ ors , 23 lung cancer , 21 gastro@@ intestinal carcin@@ omas , and 30 more ) .
in 1895 patients with solid tum@@ ours ( 6@@ 83 breast cancer , 260 Bron@@ chi@@ al carcin@@ omas , 174 gy@@ nec@@ ological tum@@ ors , 300 gastro@@ intestinal tum@@ ors and 4@@ 78 others ) and 80@@ 2 patients with hem@@ ost@@ asis .
survival and tumour progression were studied in five large controlled studies with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin patients and control patients .
in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human@@ oid er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin showed a more consistent , statisti@@ cally significant higher mortality rate than in controls .
overall survival in studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thro@@ mb@@ oses and related complications in patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin and in controls .
there is an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lic events in tumour patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin , and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded .
it is not clear how far these results relate to the use of re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin in tumour patients who are treated with chemotherapy with the aim of achieving a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value below 13 g / dl , as too few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data .
epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa conditions after repeated IV application showed a half @-@ life of approximately 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a somewhat prolonged half @-@ life of approximately 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the ser@@ um levels of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are much lower than the ser@@ um mirrors that are achieved after intraven@@ ous injection .
there is no accumulation : the ser@@ um levels remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift .
bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis is a known complic@@ ation of chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency in humans and could be attributed to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
in a study of hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis patients treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for three years , the incidence of bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis was not increased compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients who were not treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
14 Experim@@ ental studies of approximately 20 times the recommended weekly dose , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa led to reduced federal body weight , to del@@ aying the oscill@@ ation and to an increase in fet@@ al mortality .
these reports are based on in vitro findings with cells from human tumor tissue samples , which are however of uncertain significance for the clinical situation .

according to the &quot; CH@@ MP Gui@@ deline on Risk Management Systems for Human Use , &quot; an updated R@@ MP should be provided at the same time with the next updated report on the safety of the drug ( Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report , P@@ SU@@ R ) .
in addition , an updated R@@ MP should be submitted : • upon receipt of new information , which may affect the current safety specifications ( Safety Speci@@ fication ) , the drug vig@@ il@@ ance plan or the risk reduction measures within 60 days of reaching an important ( the drug vig@@ il@@ ance or risk reduction ) • upon request by the E@@ MEA
• If a heart attack or stroke occurs within one month prior to your treatment • If you suffer from unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is ( for the first time or increased chest pain ) , there is a risk of blood cl@@ ots in the veins ( deep v@@ ein th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis ) - if , for example , such a drop of blood has occurred , for example .
you suffer from severe circul@@ atory disorders of the heart ( cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ tery disease ) , the arter@@ ies of the legs or arms ( peripheral arter@@ ial disease ) , the cervi@@ cal vessels ( vascular disease of the cardiovascular ) or the cereb@@ ral ( cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ) recently suffered a heart attack or stroke .
during the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed it can occur within the normal range to a slight dose @-@ dependent increase in the number of blood plat@@ el@@ ets , which is re@@ formed during further treatment .
your doctor may , if necessary , perform regular blood tests to regularly check the number of plat@@ el@@ ets during the first 8 weeks of treatment .
lack of iron , dis@@ solving red blood cells ( hem@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 or fo@@ lic acid deficiency should be considered and treated with Ab@@ se@@ amed before the treatment begins .
er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin was reported on the occurrence of an antibody @-@ medi@@ ated er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ en@@ ia after months to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin .
if you suffer from er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ en@@ ie , it will ab@@ ort your treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is best treated .
therefore , Ab@@ se@@ amed must be given by injection into a v@@ ein ( intraven@@ ous ) if you are treated for an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease .
a high ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value may cause problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death could be increased .
in case of increased or increasing potassium levels , your doctor may take into account an interruption of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed until the potassium levels are back in the normal range .
if you suffer from chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically obvious cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ tery disease or con@@ ges@@ tion sign due to inadequate heart performance , your doctor will ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in mirror does not exceed a certain value .
according to the current findings , the treatment of an@@ se@@ amed blood vessels with Ab@@ se@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which is not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa donation and the desired effect should be taken into account for ass@@ essing the effectiveness of Ab@@ se@@ amed .
200 your doctor will regularly determine your levels of the red blood dy@@ e ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) and adjust your Ab@@ se@@ amed dose accordingly to keep the risk of blood cl@@ ots ( th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic event ) as low as possible .
this risk should be weigh@@ ed very carefully compared to the advantages derived from the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic vascular events , e.g. if you are obes@@ e or have already occurred in the past th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic vascular events ( e.g. a deep v@@ ein th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis or pul@@ mon@@ ary em@@ bo@@ li@@ sm ) .
if you are a cancer patient , remember that Ab@@ se@@ amed is a growth factor for blood cells and under certain circumstances can neg@@ atively affect the tumor .
if you have an orthop@@ edic surgery , the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly .
if your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) are too high , you should not receive Ab@@ se@@ amed as there is increased risk of blood cl@@ ots after surgery .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use / apply other medicines or have used / applied recently , even if it is not prescription medicine .
if you take C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means to supp@@ ress the immune system ) during your treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor may arrange certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
laboratory tests have shown no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are means of building the immune system , for example in cancer chemotherapy or in HIV ) .
depending on how your an@@ a@@ emia refers to the treatment , the dose can be adjusted approximately every four weeks until your condition is under control .
your doctor may need regular blood tests to check the success of the treatment and make sure that the medicine works properly and your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
once you are well adjusted , you receive regular doses of Ab@@ se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice a week , spread over two equally large inj@@ ections .
your doctor may need regular blood tests to check the success of the treatment and ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
depending on how the an@@ a@@ emia respon@@ ds to the treatment , the dose can be adjusted approximately every four weeks until the condition is under control .
to ensure this and ensure that the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , the attending physician will carry out regular blood tests .
if it is necessary to shor@@ ten the treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg can be given on 10 consecutive days before surgery , on the day of the operation and another 4 days after the operation .
however , if your doctor considers this to be appropriate , you can also learn how you inj@@ ected Ab@@ se@@ amed yourself under the skin .

Ac@@ last@@ a is used to treat the following diseases : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after menop@@ ause as well as in men .
it is used in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( frac@@ tures ) , including patients who recently suffered a minor traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture such as the H@@ inf@@ allen ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500@@ mg of calcium twice a day for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 W ) or@@ ally or by injection into a muscle before the first in@@ fusion .
the administration of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( remedy against inflammation ) shortly after the application of Ac@@ last@@ a can reduce the symptoms , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headache .
for the treatment of the Pa@@ get Mor@@ bus , Ac@@ last@@ a may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of this disease .
since the active ingredient in Ac@@ last@@ a is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material was used for Z@@ omet@@ a for the evaluation of Ac@@ last@@ a .
in the first study , nearly 8@@ ,000 elderly women with oste@@ opor@@ osis were involved , and the number of spine and hip frac@@ tures has been studied for a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years who recently had a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures over a period of up to five years was studied .
in the case of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ last@@ a was tested in two studies on a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months .
the main indicator of the efficacy was whether the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in the ser@@ um ( an enzyme that breaks down bone substance ) norm@@ alized in the blood or decreased at least 75 % compared to the initial value .
in the study with older women the risk of verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years in patients with plac@@ ebo .
the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % compared to all patients with Ac@@ last@@ a ( with or without any other oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment ) .
in the study with men and women with hip frac@@ ture , 9 % of patients with hip frac@@ ture had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under plac@@ ebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of Ac@@ last@@ a occur within the first three days after the in@@ fusion and are less frequent in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
Ac@@ last@@ a must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any other ingredients .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients with acet@@ ab@@ etic are subject to the risk of kidney complaints , in@@ fusion and oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( death of bone tissue ) in the jaw .
the Ac@@ last@@ a manufacturer provides clari@@ fication material for physicians that prescri@@ be acet@@ ob@@ la@@ a for oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment , as well as similar material for patients in which the side effects of the drug are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor .
in April 2005 , the European Commission granted the company Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited a permit for the marketing of Ac@@ coun@@ a in the entire European Union .

the Patient Information Package is intended to provide and include the following core messages : • Con@@ tra@@ dic@@ ation in pregnancy and lac@@ t@@ ating women • Re@@ as@@ ement of adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D , adequate physical activity , non smoking and a healthy diet • Sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When to resort to medical or nursing assistance
treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis • in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recent low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture .
for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men , intraven@@ ous 5 mg Ac@@ coun@@ a is recommended once a year .
patients with a low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture are recommended to admini@@ ster the in@@ fusion of acet@@ one two or more weeks after surgical care of the hip frac@@ ture ( see section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Pa@@ get Mor@@ bus , Ac@@ last@@ a should be prescribed only by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after the treatment of the Pa@@ get Mor@@ bus with Ac@@ coun@@ a , a long re@@ mission was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure sufficient calcium intake in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , corresponding twice daily at least 500 mg of el@@ em@@ ental calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of acet@@ ob@@ la@@ a ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the first Ac@@ last@@ a in@@ fusion .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of acet@@ am@@ ol can be reduced shortly after the application of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen after the application of acet@@ am@@ ol .
patients with kidney dys@@ functions ( see section 4.4 ) In the case of patients with cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min , ac@@ reli@@ a is not recommended as limited clinical experience for this group of patients is available .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dosage adjustment is not necessary as bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination are similar in older patients than in younger patients .
children and adolescents in Ac@@ coun@@ a are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age because data is missing for safety and efficacy .
acet@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) is not recommended in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) because only limited clinical experience exists for this patient population .
pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia is to be treated with acet@@ ylene by adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D before the treatment begins ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the rapid implementation of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ lic acid on the bone structure , a temporary , sometimes sympt@@ om@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop , whose maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of acet@@ ob@@ la@@ a ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get sufficient intake of calcium , corresponding twice daily at least 500 mg of el@@ em@@ ental calcium for at least 10 days after the administration of acet@@ ob@@ la@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , poor oral hygiene ) should be considered before an application of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates a dental check with appropriate preventive dental treatment .
for patients who need dental surgery , no data is available whether the interruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ opor@@ osis in the jaw@@ s .
clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days of the administration of acet@@ am@@ ol can be reduced shortly after the application of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen after the application of acet@@ am@@ ol ( see section 4.2 ) .
the incidence of suspected cases of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation was increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients receiving plac@@ ebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in the oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ c@@ ture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) , the overall frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation between Ac@@ coun@@ a ( 2.6 % ) and plac@@ ebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) adverse drug effects are listed in Table 1 .
kidney function disorder Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ lic acid was associated with kidney function disorders , which were used as a decrease of the kidney function ( i.e. , an increase in ser@@ um cre@@ atine ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure .
the change in cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clear@@ ances ( measured annually before administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as a limited kidney function were similar in a clinical study of oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years between the Ac@@ la@@ sta@@ - and Plac@@ ebo group .
a temporary increase in ser@@ um cre@@ atine within 10 days after administration was observed with 1.8 % of the patients treated with Ac@@ last@@ a compared to 0.8 % of the patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
based on the assessment of the laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic calcium values , below the normal fluctu@@ ation range ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , showed 2.3 % of patients treated with Ac@@ last@@ a in a large clinical trial compared to 21 % of patients treated with Ac@@ last@@ a in the Pa@@ get @-@ Pa@@ get trials .
all patients received adequate amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis in the study on preventing clinical frac@@ tures after a hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get trials ( see section 4.2 ) .
in the study on preventing clinical frac@@ tures after a recent hip frac@@ ture , vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reactions after the administration of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in a large clinical study was reported on local reactions at the in@@ fusion site such as redness , swelling and / or pain ( 0.@@ 7 % ) .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ ses in the jaw area have been reported , especially in cancer patients , about oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ ses ( primary in the jaw zone ) , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including c@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis , and most of the reports relate to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental intervention .
7 study involving 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients showed signs of oste@@ o@@ arthritis in the or@@ tho@@ don@@ tic area in patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
in the event of an over@@ dose that leads to clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , calcium glu@@ con@@ ate can be balanced by giving oral calcium and / or intraven@@ ous calcium glu@@ con@@ ate .
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of acet@@ ob@@ la@@ a 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was indicated in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 women at the age of 65 and 89 years ) with either a bone density ( BM@@ D ) T @-@ score for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ al ≤ -@@ 1.5 and at least two mild or a moderate @-@ weight existing spinal frac@@ ture or a BM@@ D @-@ T @-@ score for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ al ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing spinal frac@@ ture .
effects on morph@@ ometric verteb@@ rate frac@@ tures increased significantly over a period of three years and after one year the frequency of one or more new verteb@@ ral body frac@@ tures ( see table 2 ) .
patients aged 75 and older had a 60 % reduced risk of verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures compared to plac@@ ebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
effects on hip frac@@ tures Ac@@ last@@ a showed a constant effect over three years , resulting in a 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures .
effects on bone density ( BM@@ D ) Ac@@ last@@ a increased bone density on lum@@ bar spine , hip and dist@@ al radius compared with plac@@ ebo treatment significantly at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 Incre@@ ase of bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the total hip by 6.0 % , the fem@@ oral neck by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .

treatment with an annual 5 mg dose Ac@@ last@@ a significantly reduced B@@ SAP by 30 % compared to the initial value and was kept at 28 % below the initial value of up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the initial value of up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the initial value of up to 36 months .
the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ E. or@@ ally or in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion .
the total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the treated group , compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the plac@@ ebo group .
effects on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study , in comparison to plac@@ ebo treatment , the BM@@ D increased the BM@@ D at all points of time .
over 24 months , the Ac@@ last@@ a treatment led to an increase in BM@@ D by 5.4 % compared to plac@@ ebo treatment and 4.@@ 3 % on the fem@@ oral neck .
clinical efficacy in men In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study 50@@ 8 men were random@@ ised and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was evaluated after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the frequency of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in men treated in men compared to 8.@@ 7 % in plac@@ ebo .
in another study in men ( study CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , once an annual dose of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate compared to once weekly dose of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was not inferior to the percentage change in the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the initial value .
clinical effectiveness of the treatment with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone Ac@@ last@@ a was studied in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ologically confirmed , mainly mild to moder@@ ately heavy @-@ weight patho@@ gen Pa@@ get of the bone ( mean ser@@ um mirror of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to the 2.@@ 6@@ x to 3.@@ 0@@ fold age @-@ specific upper normal value when included in the study ) .
11 The efficacy of in@@ fusion of 5 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid compared to intake of 30 mg of ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once a day for 2 months was proven in two six months comparative studies .
in the combined results , a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain relief was observed in comparison to the initial value for acet@@ one and ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate .
patients who were classified as Respon@@ der at the end of the six @-@ month main study ( responded to the therapy ) could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
from the 143 with Ac@@ last@@ a and 107 patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate , the therapeutic response was observed in 141 of patients treated with acet@@ ate , compared to 71 patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate , with an average duration of the follow @-@ up period of 18 months after the application .
one @-@ time and multiple 5 and 15 minute in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data which proved to be dos@@ is@@ independent .
then the plasma level rapidly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the peak value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 hours , followed by a long period of very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the peak value .
rapid bi@@ pha@@ sic dis@@ appearance from the large cycle with half @-@ life times t ½ α 0.@@ 24 and t ½ to 1.@@ 87 hours followed by a long exp@@ ul@@ sion phase with a terminal elimination period t ½ g 146 hours .
the early distribution phases ( α and β , with the above and ½ -@@ values ) represent presumably the rapid absorption in the bones and the ex@@ cre@@ tion via the kidneys .
in the first 24 hours 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is found in the urine , while the rest is mainly bon@@ ded to bone tissue .
the total body clearance is 5,@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h independent of the dose and remains unaffected by gender , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion period from 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration versus time ) .
a decreased Clear@@ ance of the metaboli@@ zed substances by Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom @-@ P@@ 450 enzymes is unlikely because z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is not metaboli@@ zed in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , metabolism @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ -
special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al clearing of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid cor@@ related with the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ atine Clear@@ ance , and was 84 ± 29 ml / min in the 64 examined patients ( range 22 to 143 m@@ L / min ) .
this results in a slight ( c@@ c@@ r = 50 - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate kidney function distur@@ b@@ ance down to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance up to 35 ml / min does not require the dosage adjustment of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid .
because there is only limited data for severe kidney dys@@ functions ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) , no statements are possible for this population .
acute toxic@@ ity The maximum administered intraven@@ ous dose was 10 mg / kg of body weight in mice and 0.@@ 6 mg / kg body weight in rats .
in dogs studies , single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on the AU@@ C was 6 times the recommended human therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ al influence .
sub@@ cut@@ aneous and chronic toxic@@ ity In studies with intraven@@ ous application , the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid was given in rats by taking doses of 0.@@ 6 mg / kg as a 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals ( a cum@@ ulative dose that corresponds to the 7@@ x of the human therapeutic exposure related to the AU@@ C ) , well tolerated .
in long @-@ term studies with repeated use in cum@@ ulated ex@@ positions , which adequately exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects on other organs , including gastro@@ intestinal tract and liver , and the intraven@@ ous injection point .
the most frequent inf@@ estation in trials with repeated use was an increased primary sponge in the met@@ ap@@ hy@@ sis of the long bones in the growth phase with virtually all dos@@ ages , an inf@@ estation , which reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti@@ res@@ or@@ p@@ tive effect of the substance .
in rats , ter@@ ato@@ gen@@ ic@@ ity in dos@@ ages of 0.2 mg / kg was observed as outer and inner ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such a skel@@ eton .
no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed in rab@@ bits , although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg due to the low ser@@ um calcium level .
if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time after preparation and the conditions before the application ; normally 24 hours should not be exceeded at 2 ° C to 8 ° C .

Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron A@@ ci@@ d is a representative of a substance called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate and is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the patho@@ gen Pa@@ get of the bone .
decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ rogen , which are made from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the gradual loss of bone mass observed in men .
in the Pa@@ get mor@@ bus , bone reconstruction is too fast , and new bone material is structured un@@ ordered , which makes the bone material weaker than normal .
Ac@@ last@@ a works by normal@@ ising bone reconstruction , thereby ensuring normal bone formation and thus rein@@ forces strength .
if you are undergoing dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery , tell your doctor that you will be treated with Ac@@ last@@ a .
when using Ac@@ last@@ a with other medicines please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you have taken other medicines / use or have recently taken / applied , even if it is not prescription medicine .
it is particularly important for your doctor to know if you are taking drugs that are known to damage the kidneys .
when using Ac@@ last@@ a together with food and drink , you are concerned that you will receive plenty of liquid before and after treatment with acet@@ one according to your doctor &apos;s instructions .
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year administered by your doctor or nursing staff as an in@@ fusion in a v@@ ein .
if you have recently bre@@ ached the hips , it is recommended to take Ac@@ last@@ a two or more weeks after surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture .
the usual dose is 5 mg administered by your doctor or nursing staff as an in@@ fusion in a v@@ ein .
as Ac@@ last@@ a works for a long time , you may need to take another dose only after one year or more .
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium level in your blood is not too low in time after in@@ fusion .
in the case of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ coun@@ a can work for more than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a new treatment .
when the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a is missed , please contact your doctor or hospital to make an appointment .

if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for storage time and conditions up to the application ; normally 24 hours should not be exceeded at 2 ° C to 8 ° C .
patients with a recently suffered low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture are recommended to perform in@@ fusion of Ac@@ last@@ a two or more weeks after surgical care of the hip frac@@ ture .
before and after the administration of acet@@ ob@@ la@@ a , patients need to be sufficiently supplied with liquid ; this is particularly important in patients who receive di@@ ure@@ tic therapy .
due to the rapid implementation of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ lic acid on the bone structure , a temporary , sometimes sympt@@ om@@ atic , hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop whose maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of acet@@ ob@@ la@@ a .
in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure sufficient calcium intake in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , corresponding to at least twice daily 500 mg of el@@ em@@ ental calcium for at least 10 days after the administration of acet@@ ob@@ la@@ a .
in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the in@@ fusion of acet@@ one .

in addition , four studies were conducted on more than 7@@ ,000 patients , in which A@@ compli@@ a was used as a suppor@@ tive drug for setting the smoking compared to a plac@@ ebo .
on the other hand , the studies on setting up smoking did not show uniform results , so that the effect of compli@@ a was difficult to assess in this area of application .
which risk is associated with compli@@ a ? the most common side effects of compli@@ a that were observed during the studies ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) were nausea and infections of the upper respiratory tract . n@@ g The complete listing of the side effects reported in connection with compli@@ a is the package supplement .
it may also not be used in patients who suffer from severe depression or are treated with anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants as it may intensi@@ fy the risk of depression and , among other things , cause su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts among a small minority of patients .

compli@@ a is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age due to lack of data on efficacy and safety .
La Depres@@ sive Dis@@ orders or mood changes with depres@@ sive symptoms were reported at up to 10 % , su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts of up to 1 % of patients receiving Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be used in case of depres@@ sive disorders , unless the benefit of the treatment in the individual case out@@ weighs the risk ( see section 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
he also has no apparent risks in patients who - besides obesity - do not have any noticeable risks .
relatives or other close relatives ) are advised that it is necessary to monitor the occurrence of such symptoms and immediately seek medical advice if these symptoms occur .
• older patients The effectiveness and harm@@ lessness of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in the treatment of patients over 75 years were not shown sufficiently .
patients with a cardiovascular event ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or stroke , etc . ) less than 6 months were excluded from studies with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant .

we have studied overweight patients as well as in patients with obesity , and in addition to 3@@ 800 patients in further indications .
the following table ( Table 1 ) shows the adverse effects of plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies in patients treated for weight reduction and metabolic diseases .
it was statisti@@ cally significant higher than the corresponding plac@@ eb@@ or@@ ate ( for adverse effects ≥ 1 % ) or if they were clin@@ ically relevant ( for adverse effects &lt; 1 % ) . NG In case of adverse events , the following frequencies are laid down :
very often ( ≥ 10 % ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 , &lt; 10 % ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 0.1 , &lt; 1 % ) ; rare ( ≥ 0,@@ 01 , &lt; 0.1 % ) ; very t
in a di@@ lution study , given a limited number of individuals disposable up to 300 mg , only slight symptoms were observed .
the patients had a BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² or BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² and an existing hyper@@ tension and / or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ ide@@ mia .

the percentage of patients receiving a H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c@@ - value of &lt; 7 % was 51 % in the Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant group and 35 % in the plac@@ ebo group .
the difference in the mean weight change between the 20 M@@ g@@ - and the plac@@ ebo group was 3.8 kg ( CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.0 , -@@ 2.6 p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . LN
improved H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value in patients who took Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg were about 50 % due to direct effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant and about 50 % explained by weight reduction . n ei@@ m ar@@ z
the steady state plasma levels were reached after 13 days ( C@@ max = 196 ± 28.@@ 1 n@@ g / ml ; C@@ trou@@ gh = 9@@ 1,6 ± 14,@@ 1 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 = 29@@ 60 ± 26@@ 8 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml ) .
influence of food : he subjects who received Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant either in the so@@ bri@@ ety state or after a fat @-@ rich meal , showed up 67 % increased C@@ max or 48 % increased n@@ g AU@@ C in the case of food intake .
patients with black skin color can have up to 31 % lower C@@ max and a 43 % lower AU@@ C than patients of other ethnic populations .
n popul@@ ation@@ sp@@ hero@@ ic analyses ( age range between 18@@ - 81 years ) is estimated that a 75 @-@ year @-@ old patient has a 21 % higher C@@ max and a 27 % higher AU@@ C than a 40 @-@ year old male .
5.3 Prec@@ lin@@ ical data for the safety of the following un@@ desirable effects , which were not observed in clinical trials , but which occurred in animals after exposure to the human therapeutic range , were considered possibly relevant for clinical use :
in some cases , however , not in all cases , the beginning of the conv@@ ul@@ sions seems to be associated with proced@@ ural stress such as dealing with animals .
when Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant was given over a longer period before the p@@ airing ( 9 weeks ) , which allowed a recovery from the initial effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant , no unwanted effects were observed on the fertility or menstru@@ al disturbances .
the influence of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant on pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development was studied at the rat in dos@@ ages of up to 10 mg / kg / day .
in a study of rats for pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development , an exposure to the Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in uter@@ o and by lac@@ tation did not cause any changes in learning behavior or memory .

summary of the EP@@ AR for the public : this document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) has evaluated the trials carried out in order to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially overweight patients ) where met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes medication ) is not indicated . • It can be used together with another diabetes medication ( dual therapy ) .
it can also be applied to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially obes@@ e patients ) who cannot be satisfactory with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest tolerated dose .
in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ yl chlori@@ de or insulin , the present dose of the sul@@ fon@@ y@@ gum or insulin can be maintained at the beginning of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; this should reduce the dose of the sul@@ fa or insulin .
this means that the body &apos;s insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level sin@@ ks , allowing type 2 diabetes to be better adjusted .
in more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of Ac@@ tos in tri@@ ple@@ therapy was examined ; in addition , the patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or plac@@ ebo for up to 3.5 years .
in the studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tos resulted in lowering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , suggest@@ ing that the blood sugar levels were lowered when applying the doses of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of the additional dose of Ac@@ tos for existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ phon@@ yl resin was reduced by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional administration of plac@@ ebo led to a decrease of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study , in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin was examined in 28@@ 9 patients , the patients who received Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin had a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c levels of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared with 0.@@ 14 % in patients who additionally took plac@@ ebo .
the most common side effects associated with Ac@@ tos were vision disturbances , upper respiratory tract infections , weight gain and hypo@@ th@@ esi@@ ologist ( reduced sensitivity to stim@@ uli ) .
Ac@@ tos may not be used in patients who may be sensitive ( allergic ) to sp@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or any of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure , or di@@ ab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high levels of ket@@ one levels - acid levels - in the blood ) .
it has been decided that an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in should be used as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients where met@@ form@@ in is not indicated .
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted the Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited , a permit for the marketing of Ac@@ tos across the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , arch@@ ed and bear the mark &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on one side and on the other hand the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus whose blood sugar is insufficient with insulin and where met@@ form@@ in is in@@ appropriate due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see section 4.4 ) .
no data is available for the use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age , so the application in this age group is not recommended .
if the presence of at least one risk factor ( e.g. previous heart attack or sympt@@ om@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ tery disease ) is at risk of developing a de@@ compensated heart failure , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose .
patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or e@@ dem@@ a , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve .
patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and o@@ e@@ dem@@ a when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin .
cardiovascular Out@@ come study with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vascular disease was performed .
this study showed an increase in heart failure reports , which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased output liver enzyme ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one may not be used .
if the AL@@ T levels are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the Li@@ ver Enzy@@ mes are to be checked again as soon as possible .
if a patient develops symptoms that point to h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , over@@ riding disorders , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark urine , the liver enzyme levels are to be checked .
the decision to continue the treatment of the patient with a Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on should be conducted before the clinical evaluation .
in clinical studies with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been proven , which can be caused by fat deposits and in some cases associated with fluid retention .
as a consequence of h@@ emo@@ di@@ lution , a slight reduction of the mean hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction of 4.1 % ) occurred under the therapy with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one .
similar changes were observed in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 3.1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) in patients with met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , there is a risk of dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia in patients who receive Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one as oral secondary or triple combination therapy with insulin or as a dual @-@ combination therapy with insulin .
after the market launch , a reduction of visual acuity was reported in the treatment with thi@@ az@@ ole @-@ indi@@ ones , including Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , a occurrence or deterioration of di@@ ab@@ etic mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a .
it is unclear whether there is a direct connection between taking Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and the occurrence of mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a , but killing doctors should be aware of the possibility of a mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a when patients report about disorders of visual acuity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological examination should be considered .
in a summary analysis of adverse events related to bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence ran@@ ged from 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) , compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .
patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy and if a patient desires a pregnancy or if this occurs , the treatment is dep@@ rec@@ ated ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies on the interactions have shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one does not have any relevant effects on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or drug dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
interactions with medicines that are metaboli@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not expected .
the simultaneous use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) resulted in a 3 @-@ fold increase in the AU@@ C from Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a 54 % decrease in the AU@@ C from Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on .
this is due to the fact that under treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one the hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ a@@ emia resulting in pregnancy decreases and increases the availability of the metabolic substrates for fet@@ al growth .
very often &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequently &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , individual cases : unknown ( not available from this data ) .
these lead to a temporary change of the tur@@ g@@ or and refrac@@ tive index of the lens , as they are observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic agents .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T asc@@ ents across the thre@@ ef@@ old of the upper limit of the standard range were equally common to plac@@ ebo , but less frequently than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ y@@ har@@ n@@ ide .
in an Out@@ come study in patients with advanced macro@@ vascular disease , the incidence of severe cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency under pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was 1.6 % higher than plac@@ ebo , if Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or
since the market launch , it has rarely been reported about heart failure under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , but more frequently if Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
a summary analysis of adverse events related to bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years involving more than 8,@@ 100 patients in patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and more than 7,@@ 400 patients in patients treated with comparative medication .
over a period of 3.5 years of the Pro@@ Active study , frac@@ tures of 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one treated patients compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with comparative medication .
when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day for four days , then 180 mg / day for seven days , no symptoms occurred .
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on appears to have an activation of specific nuclear recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ ic@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator activated recur@@ ve g@@ amma ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) ) , leading to increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells in the animal model .
it could be shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose level in the case of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ zide was continued over two years to investigate the time until the therapeutic effect is stopped ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8,0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
at the time of two years after the start of therapy , blood glucose control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) could be maintained by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in 69 % of patients treated ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ zide ) .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study for 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was inadequate with insulin despite three months of optimization was random@@ ised to pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or plac@@ ebo .
in patients with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.@@ 45 % compared to the patients receiving only insulin ; a reduction of insulin dosage in the group treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was observed .
clinical trials for one year showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in qu@@ oti@@ ents compared to the initial values .
the effect of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus plac@@ ebo ) was tested in a small study of type 2 di@@ abe@@ tics in a small study of 18 weeks .
in most clinical studies , compared to plac@@ ebo , a reduction of total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L cholesterol levels as well as margin@@ ally but clin@@ ically not significantly increased LD@@ L cholesterol levels were observed .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduced compared to plac@@ ebo , met@@ form@@ in or G@@ lic@@ la@@ zide , total plas@@ tici@@ des and free fatty acids and increased HD@@ L cholesterol .
compared to plac@@ ebo , there was no statisti@@ cally significant increase in LD@@ L cholesterol levels under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , while in Met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ zide , decreased values were observed .
in a study of more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduced not only the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ cor@@ dial tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , which has an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride absorption and the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride synthesis .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular outcome study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vascular disease were random@@ ised to receive either Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or plac@@ ebo over a period of up to 3.5 years .
after oral application , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is absorbed quickly , whereby the peak concentrations of un@@ modified pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in the plasma usually reach 2 hours after application .
on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV to effectiveness in roughly three times the effectiveness of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative efficacy of M @-@ II is minimal .
in interaction studies , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on has no relevant effect on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
the simultaneous application of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) or with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) increases respectively lowers the plasma concentration of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( see section 4.5 ) .
after oral use of radio@@ actively marked pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in humans the marker was found mainly in rot@@ ting ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) .
the average plasma @-@ elimination length of un@@ modified pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one amounts to 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans , and the total active met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites are 16 - 23 hours .
the plasma concentrations of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy volunteers , but the rates of the oral clearance of the parent substance are similar .
in toxic@@ ological studies mice , rats , dogs and monkeys appeared in accordance with repeated administration of plasma volume enlargement with h@@ emo@@ di@@ lution , an@@ emia and reversible ec@@ centric heart hyper@@ tro@@ phy .
this is due to the fact that under treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one the hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ a@@ emia resulting in gest@@ ation reduces the insulin resistance of the mother animal and thereby dimin@@ ishes the availability of the metabolic substrates for fet@@ al growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) increased incidence of hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( in male and female rats ) and tum@@ ors ( in male rats ) of the ur@@ inary bladder was induced .
in an animal model of the family aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) the treatment with two other thi@@ ac@@ oli@@ dal @-@ indi@@ ones led to an increased frequency of col@@ onic tum@@ ours .

the calculated frac@@ ture incidence ran@@ ged from 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) , compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .
in another study for more than two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or G@@ lic@@ la@@ zide were investigated .
clinical trials for more than one year showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine qu@@ oti@@ ents compared to the initial values .
in a study of more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduced not only the ni@@ cot@@ ine tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ cor@@ dial elevated tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , this has an effect on tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eride absorption and the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride synthesis .
although the study lack@@ ed the objective of its primary end@@ point , which presented a combination of the total mort@@ ality , non @-@ fatal m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome , leg amp@@ utation above the ank@@ le , cor@@ on@@ ary rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation and rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that with the intake of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , no cardiovascular long @-@ term risks are associated .

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was studied in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes in which the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes in which the body is unable to use insulin effectively .
in the study , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured after 12 weeks , which indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror , suggest@@ ing that the blood sugar levels were reduced similarly to another human insulin .
ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , the doses of Ac@@ ci@@ ph@@ ane have to be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar ( see the complete list below ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Ac@@ ci@@ ph@@ ane were out@@ weigh@@ ed in the treatment of diabetes .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the marketing of Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane services across the European Union .
pre @-@ mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice daily , if a rapid initial effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose was inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood sugar adjustment has improved significantly through intensified insulin therapy can change the hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia alert symptoms and should therefore be advised accordingly .
any change in terms of strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , type of insulin ( fast acting , bi@@ pha@@ sic , long acting insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin or insulin analog ) and / or production method ( due to re@@ combin@@ ant DNA compared to insulin ) can cause a change in the dosage .
if a dose adjustment is required when changing to Ac@@ ci@@ ph@@ ane , it may be necessary for the first dose or in the first weeks or months after conversion .
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic reactions after changing animal to human insulin reported that early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin .
before travelling over several time zones , the patient should be advised to pick up the doctor &apos;s advice , as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times .
the doctor must therefore take into account possible interactions during therapy and always ask his patients for treatments taken by them .

hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia may develop gradually : • Light hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias can be treated by the oral intake of glucose and sug@@ ary foods .
di@@ abe@@ tics should therefore always have grape sugar , sweets , bis@@ cuits or sugar @-@ containing fruit juice . • Heavy hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias with un@@ consciousness are treated with an in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by means of an in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) or by glucose , which is given intraven@@ ously by the doctor .
the effect starts within half an hour , the maximum of action is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the entire duration of action is up to 24 hours .

this document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) has evaluated the trials carried out in order to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine .
the in@@ active ingredient in ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id , insulin human ( r@@ DNA ) , is produced using the method of the so @-@ called re@@ combin@@ ant technology :

ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin human ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the marketing of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the entire European Union .
when two types of insulin are mixed , the amount of insulin that is quickly acting must first be absorbed , followed by the amount of insulin that is active .
3 If a dose adjustment is required when you switch to Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the patient , it may be necessary during the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
before travelling over several time zones , the patient should be advised to pick up the doctor &apos;s advice , as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times .
5 General conditions and complaints at the administration site : local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions at the injection point Dur@@ ing insulin therapy , local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and ha@@ emat@@ oma occur at the injection point ) .

a clinical trial in an intensive care unit for the treatment of hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( blood sugar above 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) with 204 di@@ ab@@ etic and 13@@ 44 non @-@ di@@ ab@@ etic patients who underwent major surgical procedures has shown that a 42 % reduction in mortality induced by intraven@@ ous ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id ( blood sugar 4.4 - 6.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) reduced mortality by 42 % ( 8 % vs 4.6 % ) .
the effect starts within half an hour , the maximum of action is reached within 1.5 to 3.5 hours and the overall duration amounts to approximately 7 to 8 hours .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id was studied at a smaller number ( n = 18 ) di@@ ab@@ etic children ( aged between 6 and 12 years ) and teen@@ ager ( aged between 13 and 17 years ) .
the data is limited , but suggests that pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in children and adolescents is similar to that of adults .

Aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who have already signs of crystal deposits , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or g@@ out nodes ( &quot; stones &quot; meaning larger pri@@ mor@@ dial deposits that can lead to joint and bone damage ) .
if the ur@@ ic acid levels are still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter for two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day .
during the first treatment months there may still be some cases of g@@ out ; therefore it is recommended that the patients take at least during the first six months of treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic even further medicines for preventing rheum@@ atic sei@@ zur@@ es .
the medicine is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ transplan@@ t since it was not investigated for these groups .
in the first study , taking part in 1 0@@ 72 patients , the effectiveness of three different Aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with the plac@@ ebo ( bog@@ us medication ) and al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia ) .
in the second study , two doses of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was administered at a dose of 300 mg once a day ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid levels were below 6 mg / dl in the last three measurements .
in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of patients who received a dose of 80 mg once a day and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of patients who received 120 mg once a day in the last three measurements had a ur@@ ic acid level in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl .
in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 of 26@@ 8 ) of the patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and in none of the 134 patients under plac@@ ebo .
the most common side effects of aden@@ uria ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) include headache , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea ( nausea ) , rash and abnormal liver values .
especially in patients with heart problems in pre@@ history there may also be an increased risk of certain side effects affecting the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering the ur@@ ic acid level in the blood than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects associated with the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia in diseases that have already led to ur@@ inary deposits ( including one out of the medical history known or present at present and / or arthritis ) .
if the ser@@ um acid levels are still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase on AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x can be taken into consideration daily .
efficacy and safety have not been fully studied in patients with severe kidney function restriction ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) .
children and adolescents because there are no experiences in children and adolescents , the use of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this group of patients is not recommended .
organ transplan@@ t recipients since there are no experiences with organ transplan@@ t recipients , the use of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this group of patients is not recommended ( see section 5.1 ) .
cardiovascular disease in patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or de@@ compensated heart failure is not recommended treatment with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
as with other resin @-@ based medicines , acute rheum@@ atism can occur during the treatment process , because of the reduction of the ser@@ um ur@@ es@@ oph@@ agus , ur@@ ic acid deposits can first be mobili@@ sed in the tissue .
B. in malign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han syndrome ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases increases so far that it comes to a deposit in the ur@@ inary tract .
liver disease Dur@@ ing Phase 3 clinical studies , minor ab@@ norm@@ alities of liver function values were observed in patients treated with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to perform a liver function test before the start of the f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ ast treatment and in the further course depending on clinical findings ( see section 5.1 ) .
The@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in Z@@ was did not carry out interaction studies on F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O in@@ hibition leads to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line ( a hibition of the metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line was also reported for other X@@ O @-@ inhibit@@ ors ) .
in subjects , the simultaneous administration of fi@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen was 250 mg 2 x a day associated with an increase in fi@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ s ( C@@ max 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .
in clinical trials , the application of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not associated with clin@@ ically significant increase of adverse events .
col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / hydro@@ chlor@@ oth@@ i@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at can be used together with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or in@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without a dosage adjustment for F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at or the other active ingredient used at the same time .
in a study involving subjects , 120 mg of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x showed an average 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrate , which indicates a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at on the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vivo .
An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that simultaneous intake of a ant@@ acid , magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminum hydro@@ xi@@ de , delayed the absorption of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( around 1 hour ) and a decrease in C@@ max by 32 % , but no significant change in AU@@ C causes .
pregnancy data about a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ an@@ cies can not be concluded on the side effects of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at on pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ bor@@ ns .
animal experimental studies do not suggest either direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) .
patients should be careful when controlling a vehicle , operating machines or when performing hazardous activities until they can be reasonably sure that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC does not adver@@ sely affect their performance .
a numer@@ ically higher incidence of the cardiovascular events reported by the investig@@ ator was observed in the overall survival study of phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.3 events per 100 patient years ) and in long @-@ term extensions ( 1.4 versus 0.@@ 7 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al connection with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at could be detected .
the risk factors determined by these patients were an arter@@ ios@@ cl@@ erotic disease and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compensated heart failure in the medical history .
common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) side effects reported in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and which were reported in all F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups more than once are listed below .
diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients treated at the same time with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In the clinical studies no severe skin ras@@ hes or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed .
7 Open long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies 9@@ 06 patients have been treated for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years long and 53 patients up to 4 years with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg .
the events reported during the long @-@ term extension studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see table 1 ) .
the subsequent treatment @-@ related events were reported more than once in all F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ - treatment groups and occurred in patients who received F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient years ) , according to the data occasionally .
the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported at all in pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 or with a lower frequency :
diabetes , hyper@@ lip@@ ide@@ mia , in@@ som@@ nia , hyp@@ es@@ thesia , con@@ spic@@ uous EC@@ G , cou@@ gh , short breathe , skin dis@@ col@@ oration , skin l@@ esi@@ ons , bur@@ si@@ tis , protein uria , ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , erectile dysfunction , increase of potassium concentration in the blood , decrease of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ te number , decrease in the number of white blood cells .
the active mechanism of ur@@ ic acid is the end product of the pur@@ ine metabolism in humans and arises as part of the reaction as@@ k@@ ade hypo@@ x@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin → ur@@ ic acid .
F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is a potent , non @-@ pur@@ ine @-@ selective inhibit@@ or of the X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ x@@ O ) with a K@@ i @-@ value for in vitro @-@ inhibit@@ ing which lies below the nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar range .
clinical study results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies in phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were performed with 1,@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia and g@@ out .
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study the proportion of patients where the last three monthly ser@@ um acid levels were &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
plac@@ ebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 7 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 25@@ 8 ) for patients with a ser@@ um cancer rate at the start of study of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl .
the AP@@ EX study showed the statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority of the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with commonly used doses of al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed the statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority of the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared with the conventional dose of al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .

the lowering of the ser@@ um acid level to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the visit to the doctor in week 2 and sustained throughout the entire treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received al@@ lo@@ pas@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with ser@@ um cancer &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
the primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ren@@ al function restriction The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy in 40 patients with ren@@ al function restriction ( i.e. h .
with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC the primary efficacy end@@ point was reached at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of the patients .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage return of ser@@ um acid concentrations in subjects , irrespective of their ren@@ al function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney dys@@ functions ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ser@@ um acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl of E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of the patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ ACT study ) had a ser@@ um acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
the data from the Phase 3 open extension study collected in two years showed that reduction of the ser@@ um acid levels increased to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , so that less than 3 % of patients in the months 16 @-@ 24 needed treatment against a g@@ out ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients did not require treatment against a cast ) .
this was associated with a reduction in the size of the g@@ out , which resulted in a total dis@@ appearance of the g@@ out nodes up to 24 % in 54 % of the patients .
increased TS@@ H@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 micro@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received long @-@ term treatment with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients receiving al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in open long @-@ term extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ max ) and the area under the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased after administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dose .
for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase in AU@@ C is observed for F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , which is greater than the dose @-@ proportional increase .
after taking single or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ max amounts to approximately 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant change was observed in the percentage decrease of ser@@ um acid concentration , provided that this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent steady state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ranges from 29 to 75 l after intake of doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma protein binding of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is approximately 9@@ 9.2 % ( primary bond to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration width that is reached with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ es , these oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites are formed mainly by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ ide is mainly produced by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A8 , and 1@@ A@@ 9 .
after taking an 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ marked F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , about 49 % of the dose was found in the urine as an unchanged F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , its known oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites and its con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) , as well as further unknown met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 3 % ) .
in addition to the ex@@ cre@@ tion over the urine , approximately 45 % of the dose in the stool was found as an unchanged F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , Ac@@ yl@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ ide of the active substance ( 1 % ) , its known oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites and its con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) as well as further unknown met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 7 % ) .
special patient groups of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the C@@ max of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at did not change in relation to subjects with normal kidney function .
the average total AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased by about 1.8 times of 7.5 m g / ml in the group with normal kidney function to 13.@@ 2 μ g / ml in the group with severe kidney function .
12 Li@@ ver Func@@ tion After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild ( Chil@@ d- uth @-@ classification A ) or moderate ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh classification B ) Li@@ ver function restriction changed the C@@ max and AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites significantly compared to subjects with normal liver function .
age There were no significant changes in regard to the AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at or its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites after taking multiple oral doses of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in older patients compared to younger subjects .
carcin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ esis , impairment of fertility in male rats was found only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin stones in the highly dos@@ ed treated group , approximately 11 times the exposure to humans .
these findings are seen as a result of a specific pur@@ ine metabolism and urine combination and considered not relevant for clinical use .
it has been found that F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at has no effect on the fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day .
at high doses , which were about 3 times the therapeutic exposure , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity emerged , which accompanied by a reduction of the re@@ aring performance and a develop@@ mental delay in the descendants of rats .
ter@@ at@@ ological studies in carrying rats with ex@@ positions , approximately 4.3 @-@ fold and in carrying rab@@ bits with ex@@ positions , which amounted to approximately 13 times of human therapeutic exposure , did not have ter@@ ato@@ genic effects .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease where the bones are br@@ ittle ) in women following menop@@ ause where there is a risk of low vitamin D levels .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including an@@ ta@@ zi@@ da , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
in order to avoid irrit@@ ation of the o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient must not lie down until after the first food intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D3 are already used separately in medicines that are approved in the European Union , the company presented data origin@@ ating from previous studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to demonstrate the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in terms of increasing the vitamin D level .
after a 15 week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE was lower ( 11 % ) compared to those who only received al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( 32 % ) .
the company also presented data suggest@@ ing that the al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE corresponds exactly to the dose needed to prevent bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , muscul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal pain ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of digestive organs such as abdominal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , con@@ sti@@ pation , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , ul@@ cer ( ul@@ cer@@ a ) of es@@ oph@@ agus , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( swal@@ lowing ) , broken abdom@@ en ( blo@@ ated abdom@@ en ) as well as sour upset .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE must not be used in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity to al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D3 or any other ingredients .
it must not be used in diseases of o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes .
in January 2007 , the European Commission granted the company Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd. to appro@@ ve the transport of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE across the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; capsule @-@ shaped , white until broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7@@ 10 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other . &quot; &quot; &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is to be taken only with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including an@@ ta@@ zi@@ da , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
follow these instructions carefully to reduce the risk of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and related side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swal@@ lowed only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) after the day . • Pati@@ ents should not ch@@ ew the tablet or leave the tablet in the mouth because there is a risk of or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a .
B . pep@@ tic ul@@ cer , active gastro@@ intestinal ble@@ edings or surgical procedures in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract , except p@@ yl@@ or@@ op@@ last@@ y , can only be given under special care ( see section 4.3 ) .
es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al stro@@ kes , were reported in patients under ing@@ es@@ tion of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( some were severe and required hosp@@ itali@@ zation ) .
the doctor should therefore pay attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , and patients should be pointed out when symptoms of op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation such as dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ie , pain during swal@@ lowing or retro@@ grade pain or new or wor@@ sen@@ ing heart@@ burn the medicine can be dep@@ rec@@ ated and medical advice should be obtained ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
3 The risk of serious ill @-@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine properly and / or continue to take it after the occurrence of symptoms pointing to es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and be understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
while in large @-@ scale clinical studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate no increased risk has been detected , ga@@ stri@@ c and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a , among them some severe and with complications , were reported ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw , usually associated with tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose treatment regi@@ men mainly contain intraven@@ ous bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates .
there is no data available to indicate whether the use of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients who need a late surgical procedure reduces the risk of oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw .
clinical assessment by the attending physician is decisive for therapy planning in every patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instructed that they should take the tablet next morning when taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , after they have noticed their failure .
you should not take two tablets the same day , but continue taking one tablet per week as originally planned on the designated day of the week .
other diseases that affect the metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be treated adequately before the treatment with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines can affect the res@@ or@@ ption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate when taken at the same time .
patients need to wait for at least 30 minutes after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at before taking other medicines ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not conducted , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was taken in clinical trials together with a variety of commonly prescribed drugs without clin@@ ically relevant interactions .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for use in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not applicable neither during pregnancy nor by breast@@ feeding women .
animal studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate do not indicate directly damaging effects with regard to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw was reported in patients with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most reports stem from cancer patients , but it was also reported in oste@@ opor@@ osis patients .
nevertheless , taking ser@@ um calcium to &lt; 8.0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and ser@@ um phosph@@ ate up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) occurred in both treatment groups with similar incidence .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at In@@ follow an oral over@@ dose may occur hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia and side effects in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , ec@@ sop@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ga@@ stri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a .
col@@ ec@@ al@@ ci@@ fer@@ ol ( vitamin D3 ) vitamin D3 is produced in the skin by UV light over the conversion of 7 @-@ Deh@@ y@@ dro@@ mes to vitamin D3 .
the main effect of 1.@@ 25 @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ xy@@ pro@@ vitamin D3 is the increase of the intestinal absorption of calcium and phosph@@ ate as well as the regulation of ser@@ um calcium , the ren@@ al secre@@ tion of calcium and phosph@@ ate , bone formation and bone res@@ or@@ ption .
in severe cases , a lack of secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia , weakness of proxim@@ al muscul@@ ature and oste@@ om@@ al@@ acia can lead to a further increased risk of falls and frac@@ tures in oste@@ opor@@ otic individuals .

the effects of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ ture incidence in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women were studied in two phase III trials of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) as well as in frac@@ ture intervention trial ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 4@@ 59 ) .
in the phase III studies , the mean asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate took 10 mg / day compared to plac@@ ebo after 3 years 8.@@ 8 % on the spine , 5.@@ 9 % at the fem@@ ur and 7.@@ 8 % at the Tro@@ chan@@ ter .

in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D of spine and con@@ sol@@ ation continued ; the BM@@ D of the fem@@ oral and the entire body was maintained .
fit consisted of two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies , in which al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate daily ( 5 mg daily over 2 years and then 10 mg daily continued to be taken either over 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study , the daily dose of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate reduced by 47 % ( al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 7.@@ 9 % compared to plac@@ ebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .
res@@ or@@ ption based on an intraven@@ ous reference dose was 0.@@ 64 % of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in women between 5 and 70 mg after night fasting and two hours before intake of a standardized breakfast .

in healthy volunteers , oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times a day for five days ) did not lead to clin@@ ically significant changes in the oral bio availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in average in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 distribution studies on rats revealed that , after IV administration of 1 mg / kg , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is distributed temporarily in tissue tissues , but then quickly re@@ distributed into the bones or eliminated with urine .
ex@@ cre@@ tion Accor@@ ding to IV administration of a single dose of 14@@ C al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , about 50 % of the radioactive substance was ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the f@@ eces .
following IV administration of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al clearing of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was 71 ml / min and the systemic clearing exceeded 200 ml / min .
in rats , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at is not ex@@ cre@@ ted via the acid or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kidneys , and therefore it is not assumed that in humans the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other drugs is influenced by these transport systems .

it is administered adult patients who have transplan@@ ted a kidney or liver in order to prevent rejection of the transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system .
since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already used in the EU , the company has presented the results from previous studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from published literature .
in addition , the results of a clinical study were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ t , comparing the application of Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
the main indicator of effectiveness was the number of patients , in which the gra@@ ft was rejected after a treatment duration of one year ( for example , by examining how often a repeated organ transplan@@ t or a resum@@ ption of di@@ aly@@ sis was required ) .
in addition , shorter follow @-@ up trials were performed on 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ t and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ t and examined how a candidate is absorbed by the body in comparison to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft .

in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin ) or any other constitu@@ ents , advoc@@ ates may not be applied .
patients and doctors must be careful if others ( in particular some herbal ) drugs are taken at the same time with an advoc@@ ate as the dose or dose of the medication taken at the same time has to be adapted accordingly .

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and the treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , this can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formula and the appropriate daily dosage ; changes to the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under close @-@ mes@@ hed control of an experienced medical practitioner ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
as a consequence of switching to an alternative formulation , therapeutic pharmaceutical supervision and appropriate dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus remains intact .
the dosage of A@@ agra@@ f should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood level measurements ( see below )
after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ance , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ Tal@@ ks should be controlled before switching over and over two weeks after conversion .
systemic exposure , measured as a valley mirror , was comparable to both levels of kidney and liver transplan@@ ted patients on day 4 .
careful and repeated checks of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus &apos;s Tal@@ ks are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ t under adv@@ ent in order to ensure appropriate substance exposition in the immediate transplan@@ t phase .
since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a low clear@@ ances substance , an adjustment of the article can take several days until the Ste@@ ady State is reached .
if the patient &apos;s condition in the first postoperative period does not allow oral dosage of medicines , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment can be initiated intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca .
in order to supp@@ ress the gra@@ ft rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression must be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified .
dosage recommendations - kidney transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral advoc@@ acy therapy should start at 0.@@ 20 - 0,@@ 30 mg / kg / day as once daily addition in the morning .
further dose adjustments may later be necessary as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change in the course of the patient &apos;s stabili@@ zation after transplantation .
dosage recommendations - liver transplantation Pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral advoc@@ acy therapy should start at 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily dosage in the morning .
dosage recommendation - switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ oc@@ agra@@ f M@@ ust a transplan@@ t recipient of twice daily dosage of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules should be converted to a once daily intake of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules on a once daily intake of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules , this conversion has to take place in the ratio of 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the entire daily dose .
after a change from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va to advoc@@ ate once a day , the treatment with the recommended oral initial dose in the case of kidney and liver transplan@@ ts must commen@@ ce for the pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection .
a cor@@ ral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day should be taken once a day in adults with adult patients .
other transplan@@ t recipients , although there is no clinical experience with prostate , pancre@@ as and col@@ on transplan@@ ted patients , received Pro@@ gra@@ f in an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day , for patients with pancre@@ atic transplan@@ ted patients in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day and in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dosage adjustment in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function To maintain blood flow in the targeted area can be required in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions a reduction of the dose .
patients with reduced kidney function Sin@@ ce the ren@@ al function does not ex@@ ert an influence on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it can be assumed that dosage adjustment is not necessary .
however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , a careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of ser@@ um cre@@ atine , a calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ in and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended .
caution must be advised when mig@@ rating from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases by means of full blood Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ Tal@@ mirror controls .
it is recommended to carry out frequent checks of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels during the first two weeks after transplan@@ t , followed by peri@@ odic checks during maintenance therapy .
blood Tal@@ ks of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should also be controlled after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ance , Dos@@ age adjustments , changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or simultaneous use of substances that could change the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus whole blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) .
since A@@ agra@@ f is a drug with a low clearance , adjustments to the dose may take several days until the Ste@@ ady State has entered .
the data in clinical studies suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases when the blood level in the blood fails to exceed 20 n@@ g / ml .
in clinical practice , the treatment of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in full blood lies in the first time after liver transplantation in the range of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and kidney and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml .
during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients , blood concentrations were generally used in the range of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml .
this led to serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects which may occur as a result of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus under@@ - or over@@ exposure .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formula and the appropriate daily dosage ; changes to the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under close @-@ mes@@ hed control of a medical device experienced in transplantation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be resistant to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation was not yet available .
in order to pro@@ phyla@@ xis of corneal gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart transplan@@ t recipients and transplan@@ t recipients in childhood , no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation was pending .
due to possible interactions , which can lead to a reduction of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the intake of herbal supplements , the St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) , or other plant remedies may be avoided during a treatment with adv@@ ent ( see section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful observation of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus concentrations in the blood is required , as the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels can be subject to considerable fluctuations in such circumstances .
in rare cases , a chamber or sep@@ tic hyper@@ tro@@ phy described as cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy was observed under Pro@@ gra@@ f which can therefore also occur under Adv@@ ance agra@@ ph .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver dys@@ functions , infections , fluid over@@ load and e@@ dem@@ a .
as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of mal@@ ig@@ ner skin changes due to suitable clothing or use of a sun@@ screen with a high protection factor .
if patients who take Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus have symptoms for PRE@@ S such as head@@ aches , altered state of consciousness , conv@@ ul@@ sions , and vision disturbances , a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g . )
as advoc@@ ates contain hard capsules , ret@@ ar@@ ded , lac@@ tose , patients with rare her@@ edi@@ tary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption provide special care .
the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors from C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can influence the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and consequently increase or lower the blood values of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
therefore , it is recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels with simultaneous addition of substances that can change the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and adjust the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dose to maintain equal concentrations ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strongly pronounced interaction was associated with anti @-@ oxid@@ ants such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and V@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole as well as with the macro@@ li@@ d antibiotic , er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin , and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies showed that the rise in blood levels mainly results from the increased oral bio availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , caused by the in@@ hibition of gastro@@ intestinal metabolism .
highly dos@@ ed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one as used in acute rejection reactions can increase or decrease the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood .
the effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on the metabolism of other medications Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ hibition ; hence , the simultaneous use of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus with medicines , which are metaboli@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can imp@@ air their metabolism .
as tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can reduce the clearance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus increase the hormon@@ al exposition , decisions on contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures should be particularly cau@@ tious .
the results of animal studies have shown that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can potentially reduce the clearance of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ one and extend their half @-@ life .
the results of a small number of transplan@@ t patients have no indication that under tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and results of pregnancy .
in uter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of the new@@ born suggests potential adverse effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( in particular with regard to its effect on the kidneys ) .

the side effects profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants often cannot be determined precisely because of the underlying disease of the patient and simultaneous treatment with a large number of other medicines .
in the following , the side effects are listed in descending order : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤

infections and par@@ asi@@ tic diseases , known as other highly effective immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , are often increased in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , which often increases suscep@@ ti@@ bility to infections ( viral , bacterial , my@@ co@@ tic , prot@@ o@@ zo@@ idal ) .
cases of non @-@ Virus @-@ associated ne@@ ph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C @-@ Virus @-@ associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ k@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression therapy , including therapy with an advoc@@ ate .

due to its high molecular weight , low water solu@@ bility and high binding of er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma rot@@ eins can be assumed that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is not di@@ aly@@ sis .
the mechanism of action and pharmac@@ ological @-@ dynamic effects on the molecular level should medi@@ ate the effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus through its binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ol protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) which is responsible for the enrich@@ ment of the connection in the cell interior .
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent in@@ hibition of signal trans@@ duction path@@ ways in the T cell and thus prevents the tran@@ scription of a certain series of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes genes .

overall , the safety profile of oral Pro@@ gra@@ f in these published studies correspon@@ ded to the large studies where pro@@ gra@@ f was used in liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients for primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
lung transplantation In an interim analysis of a recently conducted multi @-@ center study with oral Pro@@ gra@@ f was reported on 110 patients receiving either tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in as part of a 1 : 1 random@@ ization .
chronic gra@@ ft rejection , the bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis obl@@ iter@@ ative syndrome , was less common in the first year after the transplan@@ t ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) .
the survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in Group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) .
in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , there occurred in 21.@@ 7 % of the cases for the emergence of a bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis obl@@ iter@@ ans compared to 3@@ 8.0 % below C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) .
the number of cases where C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be converted to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 13 ) was significantly larger ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients undergoing tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , An@@ n Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 5@@ 80 ) .
the number of cases where there was no acute gra@@ ft rejection occurred after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) in the lung transplan@@ ted patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) .
in a study , the incidence of a bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis obl@@ iter@@ ative syndrome was significantly lower in the patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
pancre@@ atic transplantation A multi @-@ centric study with oral Pro@@ gra@@ f was performed in 205 patients who underwent a pancre@@ as and kidney transplan@@ t at the same time receiving a random@@ ised tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initial dose ( per protocol ) of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then used to achieve the target range from 8 to 15 n@@ g / ml on 5 .
in 155 patients ( 65 only intest@@ ines , 75 liver and intest@@ ines and 25 mul@@ tiv@@ is@@ cer@@ al transplan@@ ts ) in 155 patients ( 65 only intest@@ ines , 75 liver and intest@@ ines and 25 mul@@ tiv@@ is@@ cer@@ al transplan@@ ts ) showed an up @-@ to @-@ date survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years .

factors such as low ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ rit and low protein concentrations that lead to an increase in the un@@ bound fraction of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , or a strengthening of metabolism caused by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , should be responsible for the higher clearing rates observed after transplantation .
this suggests that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is almost completely metaboli@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby ex@@ cre@@ tion is mainly done via the bile .
the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was approximately 10 % lower than under Pro@@ gra@@ f for stable patients ( once daily ) in relation to a total daily dose of 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) in relation to the total daily dose .
it is recommended to carry out frequent checks of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels during the first two weeks after transplan@@ t , followed by peri@@ odic checks during maintenance therapy .
21 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be resistant to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation was not yet available .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver dys@@ functions , infections , fluid over@@ load and e@@ dem@@ a .

advoc@@ ates are used to treat and prevent hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages in patients with ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( a con@@ genital blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorder caused by the lack of factor VI@@ II ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether adv@@ ate is used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding during surgical procedures .
patients with hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A suffer from a factor VI@@ II deficiency , which causes blood cl@@ ot@@ ting problems such as bleeding in the joints , muscles or inner organs .
oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but is produced using a method called re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology :
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced to enable the formation of the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II .
advoc@@ ate is similar to another medicine approved in the European Union called Recom@@ bin@@ ate , but is made differently , so that the medicine does not contain proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A , including a study of 53 children under six years , the use of the medicine for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures was studied .
in the main study , the efficacy of Adv@@ ate in the prevention of bleeding into 86 % of 510 new blood sep@@ tic episodes was rated &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; good . &quot;
the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , headache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies to factor VI@@ II .
advoc@@ ates may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the human od@@ ine factor VI@@ II , mouse or witch protein , or one of the other ingredients .
in March 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Ba@@ x@@ ter AG a permit for the marketing of Adv@@ ate in the entire European Union .
dosage The dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution therapy depend on the sever@@ ity of the factor VI@@ II deficiency , according to the location and the extent of the bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient .
in the case of the following hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages , the factor VI@@ II activity should not fall below the indicated plasma levels ( in % of the standard or in I.@@ E. / dl ) .
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer until the pain and acute impairment are removed .
repeat inj@@ ections every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) until the risk is over for the patient .
during the course of treatment , a proper determination of the factor VI@@ II plasma levels is recommended for controlling the dose and frequency of inj@@ ections .
individual patients can differ in their response to factor VI@@ II , achieve different in vivo recovery and exhibit different half @-@ value periods .
3 pro@@ phyla@@ xis for long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages in patients with severe hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A should be doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VI@@ II per kg body weight within 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VI@@ II plasma activity is not reached or if bleeding is not controlled with a reasonable dose , a test must be performed in order to verify an inhibit@@ or .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that the factor VI@@ II therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures have to be considered .
the speed of administration should depend on the patient &apos;s condition whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies against factor VI@@ II is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in treating patients with hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always opposed to the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VI@@ II Ig@@ G immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma via modified Be@@ thes@@ da As@@ say .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates to the extent of exposure to factor VI@@ II , whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure days is greatest and depends on genetic and other factors .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 exposure days and an an@@ am@@ n@@ estic known inhibit@@ or development , following conversion from a re@@ combin@@ ant Factor VI@@ II product to another , the recur@@ r@@ ence of ( low ) inhibit@@ ors was observed .
due to the rare occurrence of hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A in women , the use of factor VI@@ II during pregnancy and lac@@ tation do not occur .
the A@@ DR@@ s in the largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors against Factor VI@@ II ( 5 patients ) , all with previously untreated patients who have a higher risk of the formation of inhibit@@ ors , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data is not inv@@ alu@@ able ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated using the sum of the individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) . the unexpected drop in the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting factor VI@@ II @-@ Spi@@ eg@@ els occurred post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10th - 14th postoperative day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE in@@ fusion .
blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the time and both the factor VI@@ II@@ - mirror in plasma and the clearing rate showed again sufficient values on the 15th day postoperative day .
in clinical studies with A@@ DV@@ ATE in 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed heavy to moderate ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) only one patient showed a low inhibit@@ or@@ ti@@ ter ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in modified Be@@ thes@@ da approach ) after 26 exposure days ( ≥ 150 days ) .
in addition , in none of the 53 pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed heavy to medium @-@ severe hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) after previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) a F@@ VI@@ II inhibit@@ or was found .
in the previously untreated patients of a ongoing clinical study , 5 of 25 ( 20 % ) of patients treated with A@@ DV@@ ATE treated patients with factor VI@@ II .
the patient &apos;s immune response to traces of contam@@ in@@ ating proteins was analysed by examining the antibodies against these proteins , lab parameters and reported side effects .
a patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend as well as a persistent peak of the anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , but otherwise there were no signs or symptoms that showed an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
four patients were reported on the occurrence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , Pr@@ ur@@ itus , rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ op@@ hil@@ ous gran@@ u@@ lo@@ ytes in several repeated product ex@@ positions within the study .
7 As with other intraven@@ ous products A@@ DV@@ ATE reported over hyper@@ sensitivity reactions from the allergic type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ to@@ i@@ der reactions ( frequency not known ) .
the activated factor VI@@ II acts as a C@@ of@@ ac@@ tor for the activated factor IX and acceler@@ ates the formation of activated by factor X by factor X .
all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ DV@@ ATE have been performed on previously treated patients with severe or medium @-@ severe hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( basic value of factor VI@@ II activity ≤ 2 % ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters come from a cross @-@ over study with A@@ DV@@ ATE in 100 previously treated patients or &gt; 10 years and are listed in table 3 below .

based on the data available since the initial approval , the CH@@ MP still evaluated the benefit risk assessment as positive , but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore , the CH@@ MP has decided on the basis of the A@@ DV@@ ATE safety profile , which necess@@ it@@ ates a submission of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , decided that the authorisation holder should apply for further extension in 5 years .
in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited officially approved the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the company has withdrawn its application for the marketing of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
normally , however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the soft parts ( tissue that links other structures in the body , surrounds and supports ) are affected .
this is a type of virus that has been genetically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which has been modified so that it cannot produce copies of itself and thus cannot trigger infections in humans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
adv@@ ex@@ in would have been inj@@ ected directly into the tumour and thus enable cancer cells to re @-@ form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 protein produced from the p@@ 53 gene that is not defective in the human body normally contributes to the restoration of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when DNA cannot be recovered .
in the case of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , with which the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and divide .
the company presented data from a study with a patient with Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the abdom@@ en , bones and brain .
after the CH@@ MP had examined the company &apos;s answers to the questions posed to him , some questions were still unclear .
based on the review of the initial submitted documents , the CH@@ MP creates a list of questions sent to the company on day 120 .
according to the CH@@ MP opinion it has not been sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ore brings benefits to patients .
the committee also had concerns about the treatment of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the medicine .
in addition , the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be produced in a reliable way and that it is harmful neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient .
the company did not inform the CH@@ MP about whether the withdrawal has consequences for patients currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; Com@@ passionate @-@ Use &quot; programmes with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed drug release &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are composed so that one of the effective components is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze is used to treat the symptoms of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( ha@@ y fever , inflammation of the nas@@ al path@@ ways caused by p@@ ollen ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cous swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) .
for adults and adolescents from 12 years onwards , the recommended dose of a@@ ero a@@ ze is twice a day a tablet intended to be taken with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and ended as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are cl@@ oned .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medicine can be trac@@ ed to the con@@ sti@@ pation of the nose .
the main effects were the changes of the sever@@ ity of the ha@@ y fever symptoms , which were reported by the patients before the beginning of treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
considering all the ha@@ y fever symptoms other than the con@@ sti@@ pation of the nose , the patients who took Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze reported a decrease in symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % , compared with 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in patients who took pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone .
if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was seen , the patients with Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed a reduction of the symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients who received the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n alone .
the most common side effects of a@@ ero ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( heart ch@@ ase ) , dry mouth , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ om@@ otor hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ pation , headache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( som@@ nia ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ency ( sleep@@ iness ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or any of the other ingredients , against adren@@ ergi@@ c active agents or Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( another medicine for the treatment of allergies ) .
aer@@ ation should also not be used in patients who suffer from severe glaucoma ( hyper@@ tension ) , cardiac or vascular diseases including hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ re@@ osis ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ re@@ osis ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ) or a hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted the company SP Europe a permit for the marketing of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in the entire European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water but it is swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without breaking , breaking or ch@@ ewing ) .
aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze should not be used for children under 12 years due to lack of data on safety and efficacy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is to be kept as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms have been dis@@ continued .
it is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days , as long @-@ term use may decrease the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with time .
after the swelling of the mu@@ cous membranes in the upper respiratory tract , the treatment can be continued as a mon@@ otherapy as needed .
since Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or within 2 weeks of ending such therapy .
this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined use of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , per@@ go@@ lid , li@@ thop@@ hy@@ d@@ ot@@ amine , cab@@ erg@@ olin , erg@@ ot@@ amine , d@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other de@@ on@@ ges@@ tiv@@ a that are used per@@ or@@ ally or nas@@ al as abnormal r@@ hin@@ oc@@ op@@ last@@ y ( phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ oline , nap@@ haz@@ olin , etc . ) .
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not tested for this patient subj@@ ec@@ tivity and the data are not sufficient to address appropriate dosage recommendations .
the safety and efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze have not been tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data are insufficient to address appropriate dosage recommendations .
patients must be informed that treating hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as , nausea or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as headache or ampli@@ fication of head@@ aches ) must be removed .
patients with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder neck ob@@ struction or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is at least 48 hours before the der@@ mat@@ ological test is carried out , as anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines otherwise inhi@@ bit positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions or can be reduced to their extent .
in the course of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , in which er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole was additionally administered , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were observed .
the results of the psych@@ om@@ otor testing showed no significant differences between the patients treated with the plac@@ ebo and the plac@@ ebo @-@ treated patients , regardless of whether they were taken alone or with alcohol .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out .
in vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhibit@@ ing and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
the harm@@ lessness of the application of aer@@ ob@@ ics during pregnancy is not assured , however , experience gained from a large number of affected pregn@@ an@@ cies did not increase the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of the normal population .
since reproductive studies on animals are not always transmitted to humans and based on the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tive properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , aer@@ ob@@ ics should not be used during pregnancy .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases there may be a di@@ zz@@ iness that may lead to impairment of traffic air@@ ti@@ ghtness or the ability to operate machines .
the symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S @-@ depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , decreased mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ an@@ osis , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and a CN@@ S stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with possible sequ@@ ential processes .
headache , anxiety , difficult mic@@ tion , muscular weakness and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , respiratory in@@ suffici@@ ency , cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , thirst , tran@@ spir@@ ation , nausea , vom@@ iting , pre@@ cor@@ di@@ al pain , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , vision disturbances and hyper@@ tension or hyp@@ ot@@ ony .
a CN@@ S stimulation is particularly likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( dry mouth , pup@@ il stiff@@ ness and - di@@ lat@@ ation , redness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include in@@ hibition of the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the adhesion molecules P @-@ sel@@ ec@@ tivity to endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of flight performance including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or tasks associated with flying .
in controlled clinical studies , at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily no increased incidence of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo was observed .
the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in the recommended dosage can produce other sy@@ mp@@ a@@ thetic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestations of CN@@ S arous@@ al .
there were 1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients receiving aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze tablets .
in both studies , the hist@@ amine @-@ antagon@@ istic efficacy of aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze tablets was significantly higher than a single mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined on the basis of nas@@ al mu@@ cous swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n over the 2 weeks treatment period .
the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or eth@@ ni@@ city .
as part of an individual dose study for pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of aer@@ ob@@ ics , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes of administration of the plasma .
after the per@@ or@@ tal application of aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze in healthy subjects over 14 days , the flow equilibrium of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached on day 10 .
as part of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study carried out with the formulation as a tablet for healthy adult subjects , it was found that four test subjects were poorly metaboli@@ zed .
a component interaction study shows that the exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was bio@@ equivalent after the sole administration of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine .
based on the conventional research on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , however , prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n do not identify any particular dangers to humans .
the combination possessed no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine .
in reproductive toxic@@ ological studies , the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n / pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ ato@@ genic in oral administration of rats in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and in rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day .

A@@ eri@@ us was examined in a total of eight studies with approximately 4,@@ 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four trials in seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies of patients who also had asthma ) .
the effectiveness has been measured by determining the change in the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the quad@@ ran@@ ches , sleep and performance in the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment .
further studies have been presented to prove that the body uses the sy@@ rup , the solution to take @-@ in and the melt tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is safe .
in case of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease of the symptom scores ( symptom scores ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in the patients receiving a plac@@ ebo .
in the two trials of Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the decrease of the symptom scores after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % was compared with 40 and 33 % in patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , or any of the other components .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in January 2001 , the European Commission granted the company SP Europe a permit for the marketing of A@@ eri@@ us across the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one tablet once a day , with one or without a meal , to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical trials for efficacy in the application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should be performed according to the previous course of the disease and can be terminated after the symptoms have been dis@@ continued and resum@@ ed after re@@ acting .
in case of persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) , a continuous treatment can be recommended to the patient during the allergy period .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets , in which er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally given ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol was not enhanced the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may cause di@@ zz@@ iness , which can lead to impairment of traffic air@@ ti@@ ghtness or the ability to operate machines .
clinical trials in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
the most common side effects reported in plac@@ ebo were fatigue ( 1.2 % ) , dry mouth ( 0.8 % ) and headache ( 0.@@ 6 % ) .
in a clinical study involving 5@@ 78 you@@ thful patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common side effect was head@@ aches , this occurred at 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and in 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study where up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) were administered , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
this includes in@@ hibition of the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the adhesion molecules P @-@ sel@@ ec@@ tivity to endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
as part of a clinical study involving multiple doses , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) was administered over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval showed itself .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of flight performance including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as s@@ ne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tears of tears and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may also be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , depending on the duration of the symptoms .
an inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks .
as shown in the overall results of the questionnaire on quality of life near Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was investigated on behalf of further forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria because the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology , not@@ withstanding the eti@@ ology of the different forms , is similar and chronic patients can be easily pro@@ spec@@ tively recru@@ ited .
since hist@@ amine irrit@@ ation is a caus@@ ative factor in all ur@@ inary diseases , it is expected that in addition to chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , there is also an improvement in symptoms in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines .
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials for 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of d@@ les at the end of the first dose interval .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not respond to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines was excluded from the study .
improvement of the itch by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo compared to 19 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us significantly reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and w@@ aking , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evaluating these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , where patients were comparable to the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , 4 % of patients achieved a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after once daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines are not completely excluded .
in @-@ vivo studies , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhibit@@ ing and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
in a single dose study with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , calorie rich breakfast ) did not affect the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
the prec@@ lin@@ ical studies conducted with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no qualitative or quantitative differences with respect to the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
based on conventional research on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n do not identify any particular dangers to humans .

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of the meals to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ bing physician should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s in children under 2 years are caused by an infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that no data exists which support a treatment of an infectious Rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
apart from the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , the diagnosis of an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and corresponding laboratory and skin tests should play a role in the diagnosis .
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metaboli@@ ze and experience a higher substance load ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years , which is restricted to metabolic , is identical to that of children who metaboli@@ ze normally .
this medicine contains su@@ c@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ c@@ tose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ lac@@ tose absorption or su@@ c@@ rose is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ e- in@@ suffici@@ ency of this medicine should not be taken .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , in which er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally given ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , while taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol was not enhanced the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children aged 2 to 11 was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup group similar to the plac@@ ebo group .
clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in different indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria were reported at the recommended dose 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and adolescents with up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
children aged between 1 and 11 who came into question for anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy received a daily loss dose of 1.@@ 25 mg ( between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n are similar in adults and children , the efficacy data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population .
as part of a clinical study involving multiple doses of adults and adolescents in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) was applied for ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was shown .
in controlled clinical studies , at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents , there was no increased incidence of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo .
during a single daily dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical trials were not impaired by psych@@ om@@ otor disorders .
in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous intake of alcohol was neither an increase in alcohol @-@ induced deterioration of the performance nor an increase in drow@@ sin@@ ess .
in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as s@@ ne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tears of tears and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as shown in the overall results of the questionnaire on quality of life near Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the caused by seasonal changes in rh@@ initi@@ s .
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials for 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of d@@ les at the end of the first dose interval .
the prolifer@@ ation of this restricted path@@ ological phen@@ otype was similar to adults ( 6 % ) and children aged 2 to 11 ( 6 % ) and in both populations bigger in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ ca@@ si@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with the sy@@ rup formulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , which are restricted .
the load ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was approximately 6@@ times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ max 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ life of approximately 120 hours .
there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant drug accumulation after once daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In various single dose studies , the AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ max values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in pedi@@ at@@ ric patients were comparable to those of adults who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out .
A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup is offered in type III brown glass bottles with a child @-@ safe polypropylene closing cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml .
equipped with a rigid , transparent polystyrene measuring spoon , calibr@@ ated with 2.5 ml and 5 ml or with an application sy@@ ringe for application with sc@@ aling of 2.5 ml and 5 ml ( only for the 150 ml bottle ) .

immediately before the application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the ly@@ op@@ hili@@ s@@ ate dose can be taken without damaging it .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , in which er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally applied ( see section 5.1 ) .
clinical trials in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study where up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times clinical dose ) were used , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
in two single dose studies , A@@ eri@@ us ly@@ op@@ hili@@ s@@ ate was well tolerated ; clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data were documented .
as part of a clinical study involving multiple doses , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) was applied over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval showed itself .

in a 17 single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of flight performance including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as s@@ ne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tears of tears and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as shown in the overall results of the questionnaire on quality of life near Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .

two A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg melt tablets once daily in the mouth to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical trials for efficacy in the application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
immediately before the application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the enam@@ el tablet must be taken without damaging it .
the efficacy and safety of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of fusion tablets during the treatment of children under 6 years have not been proven until now .
the overall frequency of adverse events between the plac@@ ebo group and the plac@@ ebo group was the same and did not differ significantly from the safety profile observed in adult patients .
at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us processed processed tablets as a bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ op@@ hili@@ s@@ ate for the decreasing formulation of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
as part of a clinical study involving multiple doses , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clinical
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of flight performance including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or tasks associated with flying .
the spread of this poorly @-@ metaboli@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable to adult ( 6 % ) and pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) , and in bl@@ acks ( adults 18 % , children 16 % ) , the safety profile of these patients was not different from that of the general population .
in single @-@ dose crossover trials of A@@ eri@@ us Mel@@ ting tablet with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ op@@ hili@@ s@@ ate , the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent .
A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not examined by pedi@@ at@@ ric patients , but in combination with the dose @-@ finding studies in children , however , pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us melt tablets supports the use of the 2.5 mg dosage in children aged 6 to 11 years .

at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of fusion tablet turned out to be a bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ op@@ hili@@ s@@ ate for the decreasing formulation of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
as part of a clinical study involving multiple doses , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a 30 single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of flight performance including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as s@@ ne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tears of tears and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
in single @-@ dose crossover trials of A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of fusion tablet with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ op@@ hili@@ s@@ ate , the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent .
the overall analysis of prec@@ lin@@ ical and clinical irrit@@ ation tests for the melting tablet shows that this formulation is an unlikely risk for local irrit@@ ation in clinical application .
the safety of lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in children between 2 and 11 years , which is restricted to metabolic , is identical to that in children who metaboli@@ ze normally .
this medicine contains sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ c@@ tose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose @-@ absorption or su@@ c@@ rose is@@ om@@ alt@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine .
overall incidence of adverse events in children aged 2 to 11 was similar to the plac@@ ebo group .
in infants aged between 6 and 23 months , the most common side @-@ effects reported in plac@@ ebo was diar@@ rho@@ ea ( 3.@@ 7 % ) , fever ( 2,3 % ) and in@@ som@@ nia ( 2,3 % ) .
in an additional study , at a single dose of 2.5 mg of a lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n solution , no side effects were observed in patients aged between 6 and 11 years .
in the recommended doses , the plasma concentrations of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( see under Section 5.2 ) were comparable in the children &apos;s and adult population .
in controlled clinical studies , at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents , there was no increased incidence of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may , depending on the duration of symptoms , alternatively also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and
as shown on the overall results of the questionnaire on quality of life near Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the burden caused by seasonal allergies to rh@@ initi@@ s .

since A@@ eri@@ us &apos;s solution contains the same concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , no bio@@ equivalent study was needed and it is expected that it corresponds to sy@@ rup and tablets .
various single dose studies showed that the AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ max values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in pedi@@ at@@ ric patients were comparable to those of adults who received the &apos; Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n &apos; sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .

in June 2008 , Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. officially approved the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the company res@@ umes its application for the pro@@ stitution of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov for the prevention of the avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influ@@ enza in adults and elderly people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against influ@@ enza caused by the tribe ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influ@@ enza A virus .
this is a special type of vaccine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
a flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus appears , which can easily spread from man to person , because people have not built immunity ( no protection ) against it .
after the vaccine is administered , the immune system recognis@@ es the parts of the influ@@ enza virus contained in the vaccine as &quot; foreign &quot; and forms antibodies against it .
as a result , the immune system will later be able to produce antibodies against this common influ@@ enza virus in contact with a flu virus .
subsequently , the membrane shell of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , recognis@@ es the human body as foreign @-@ foreign ) , was puri@@ fied and used as a constitu@@ ent of the vaccine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a survey of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good clinical practice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( G@@ CP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the scope of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pre @-@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines .
should you take part in a clinical trial and need more information about your treatment , please contact your attending doctor .
if you would like more information regarding the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is used in combination with other an@@ tivi@@ ral medicines to treat adults and children over four years which are infected with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients unable to swal@@ low the capsules , a@@ gener@@ a is available as a solution to take @-@ in , but it cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r since the safety of this combination has not been studied .
a@@ gener@@ a should only be prescribed when the doctor has examined the an@@ tivi@@ ral medicines of the patient before , and has judged the lik@@ el@@ ihood of the virus to respond to the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , taken together with twice a day 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other an@@ tivi@@ ral medicines .
for children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ gener@@ ase is based on body weight .
A@@ gener@@ ase reduces the amount of HIV in the blood when combined with other an@@ tivi@@ ral medicines and keeps them at a low level .
aids does not cure AIDS , however , can delay the damage to the immune system and thereby also the development of HIV @-@ related infections and diseases .
A@@ gener@@ a was studied in combination with other an@@ tivi@@ ral medicines but without rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies of 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had not previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the treatment of low @-@ dose k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased in 20@@ 6 adults , formerly occupied with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , compared to other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the modification of the viral load after treatment .
in the studies with patients who had previously had no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , more patients had a viral load under 400 copies / ml than plac@@ ebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gener@@ a reduced the viral load , however , with the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , only very few responded to the treatment .
in the study with adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the treatment with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased the viral load after 16 weeks treatment as effectively as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , A@@ gener@@ a combined with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased the viral load after four weeks as in patients who continued their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rho@@ ea , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , nausea , vom@@ iting , rash and fatigue .
2 / 3 A gener@@ ali@@ ase must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r or any of the other components .
it may not be used in patients , the St. John &apos;s wort ( an herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or drugs that are broken down just like A@@ gener@@ a and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood .
as with other medicines for HIV , patients who take a@@ eti@@ asis take the risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( death of bone tissue ) or an immune activation syndrome ( symptoms of infection caused by the re@@ covering immune system ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the advantages of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children over four years have out@@ weigh@@ ed the risks .
A@@ gener@@ a is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee found that the use of A@@ gener@@ a in combination with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who had previously not taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors is not proven .
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ a was originally supposed to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because only limited information was available for scientific reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted the Gla@@ xo Group Limited its approval for the marketing of A@@ gener@@ a in the entire European Union .
A@@ gener@@ ase is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medications for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 , prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
usually A@@ gener@@ a capsules should be administered to pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic booster of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r together with low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should take place taking into account the individual viral resistance pattern and the pre@@ treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than from Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ a capsules and solution for taking on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base are not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ a capsules is 600 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day together with 100 mg of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medications .
2 If ast@@ er@@ ase capsules are used without the intensi@@ fying addition of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( booster ) , higher doses of ast@@ er@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of a@@ gener@@ a combined with low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not studied in children .
a@@ gener@@ a is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age due to lack of data for safety and efficacy ( see Section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ a capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily in adult patients with moderate liver function disorder up to 300 mg twice daily .
the simultaneous use should be treated with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
as@@ gener@@ a must not be given at the same time with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and also represent medi@@ ums of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ dic enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r while taking Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ a or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of the HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of transmission from HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
generally A@@ gener@@ a capsules should be used together with low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy have an increased risk of severe liver damage with potentially deadly hist@@ ories .
for the case of simultaneous an@@ tivi@@ ral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant specialist information of this medicine .
patients with pre @-@ existing liver function including chronic @-@ active hepatitis show an increased incidence of liver dys@@ functions under anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and should be monitored in accordance with clinical practice .
the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ tic@@ as@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids , which can be metaboli@@ zed via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended unless the possible benefit of a treatment out@@ weighs the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids including mor@@ bus Cus@@ hing and supp@@ res@@ ection of the adren@@ al function ( see section 4.5 ) .
since the metabolism of the H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ a with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis .
4 For some medicines which may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under the supervision of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration .
in patients taking this medicine at the same time , a@@ gener@@ a may be less effective due to reduced plasma levels of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the efficacy of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives can be altered , however the information is insufficient to estimate the type of interactions .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is also given to Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r at the same time , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ ium withdrawal symptoms , especially if low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered .
due to the potential risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high propylene gly@@ col content of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under a age of four years and should be used with care in certain other patient groups .
a@@ gener@@ a should be set to 5 , if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
patients who received anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors were reported on the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia or an exac@@ er@@ bation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other diseases that were needed to treat medications that are associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
B. increased age , and associated with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
in hem@@ op@@ hili@@ c patients ( Type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase in hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ or@@ rho@@ sis occur .
in cases of HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections can develop , leading to severe clinical conditions or wor@@ sen@@ ing of symptoms .
although a multi @-@ fac@@ torial eti@@ ology is assumed ( including application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of oste@@ o@@ arthritis were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 substrates with low therapeutic width a@@ gener@@ a must not be given at the same time with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and can also display medi@@ ums of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ cylinder 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be combined with medicines whose active ingredients are mainly metaboli@@ zed via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with increased plasma levels with serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % decrease in the AU@@ C by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
in the attempt to compensate the reduced plasma levels by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , adverse effects on the liver were often observed .
the ser@@ um mirror of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be reduced by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient is already registered in the Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut , the amp@@ on@@ avi@@ rus level and , if possible , check the viral load and replace the car@@ ob .
dosage adjustment for one of the drugs is not necessary if nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
50@@ 8 % higher , whereas C@@ max decreases by 30 % if k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical trials , doses of 600 mg of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r were used twice a day and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily which prove the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme .
52 % lower if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with calcium ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma achieved in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , but a close @-@ mes@@ hed monitoring is recommended , as the effectiveness and harm@@ lessness of this combination is not known .
there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study carried out in combination with di@@ aly@@ sis in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , however , due to the f@@ anci@@ ful component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in it is recommended that the revenues of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) .
therefore , when using E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , no dose adjustment is required .
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended since the exposure of both prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors would be low .
the effects of Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in on other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggest that ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ ine may possibly lower the ser@@ um concentration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
if this medicine should be used at the same time , caution is advisable because Del@@ avi@@ r@@ dine may be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma levels .
if these drugs are used together , caution is required ; thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be carried out as precise predic@@ tion of the effect of the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
the simultaneous administration of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r and ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin caused an increase in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % , resulting in an increase in side effects associated with ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ a , a reduction in the dose of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin will be reduced to at least half of the recommended dose , although there are no clinical data available for this .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin in combination with er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin were not performed , but the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration .
simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole with 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase in the C@@ max of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) to 2.@@ 69@@ fold compared to the value observed after 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once a day without simultaneous use of Fos@@ am@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines that are listed below , including medi@@ ums , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors from C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 may possibly cause interactions when used together with A@@ gener@@ a .
patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions related to these drugs if used in combination with a@@ gener@@ a .
based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it is advisable that An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da should not be taken at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase since it can cause res@@ or@@ ption disorders .
simultaneous use of anti@@ conv@@ ul@@ s@@ ants known as enzyme induc@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can lead to a degradation of the plasma levels of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the ser@@ um concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , ri@@ odi@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin
simultaneous intake with as@@ on@@ ase can increase their plasma concentrations and strengthen with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in conjunction with side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study , in which k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g of flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of subjects , the Fluor@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels increased significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous administration of azi@@ onn@@ avi@@ r together with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids is not recommended unless the potential benefit of a treatment out@@ weighs the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( see section 4.4 ) .
H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is highly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are pronounced increases in plasma levels while con@@ serving as@@ says .
since plasma level increases of these H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy , including a r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of these drugs with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not recommended .
frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations to stabili@@ zation of the mirrors is recommended as plasma concentrations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased with simultaneous administration of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) .
therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase should not be used together with an or@@ ally @-@ recorded mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) , while simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ a with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am is advisable .
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hibit@@ ors point to a possible increase in the plasma levels of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around 3 to 4 times .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ ium withdrawal symptoms , especially if low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered .
because of the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , there is no recommendation at the moment how to adapt the AM@@ dynam@@ avi@@ r@@ - dose if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is administered simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ one .
with simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with A@@ gener@@ a , increased control of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ulated R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional dosage of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , so alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are also recommended .
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants ( e.g. des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended con@@ current offering of A@@ gener@@ a ( see section 4.4 ) .
during pregnancy , this drug may be used only after careful weighing of the potential benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
lac@@ t@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected in milk lac@@ tate , but it is not known whether Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r transl@@ ates into breast milk .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the ni@@ st@@ ination in the uter@@ us to the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in 12 body weight during breast@@ feeding .
the further development of seed , including fertility and reproductive capacity , was not affected by the administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the dam .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ a was studied in adults and in children over 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medications .
most of the side effects associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment were mild to moderate , early on and rarely led to the treatment of treatment .
many of these events have not been clari@@ fied whether they are in connection with taking A@@ gener@@ a or another medicine used for HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of underlying disease .
most of the side effects listed below come from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 3@@ 001 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors received 1200 mg A@@ gener@@ ase twice a day .
events ( degree 2 to 4 ) which were evaluated by the investig@@ ators as in connection with the study medication and performed in more than 1 % of patients , as well as laboratory changes occurring in the treatment ( grade 3 to 4 ) are listed .
anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of the body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including a loss of peripheral and vis@@ cer@@ al fatty tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the breasts and thor@@ ac@@ ic fat accumulation ( breast@@ feeding ) .
among 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ pre@@ treated persons who had been treated with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with lam@@ i@@ v@@ ud@@ ine / zi@@ do@@ v@@ ud@@ ine over an average duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( breast@@ feeding ) ( &lt; 1 % ) was observed .
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 , in comparison to 27 cases ( 3 % ) in patients treated with NSC 631570 ( 11 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients ( 11 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients ( 11 % ) , in combination with various N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
skin ras@@ hes were usually mild to moderate , er@@ y@@ them@@ at@@ ous or mac@@ ul@@ omat@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and usually occurred during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without having to cancel the treatment with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
oste@@ o@@ arthritis cases were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV infection or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
in cases of HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections can be developed at the time of initiation of anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
patients who received 600 mg A@@ gener@@ ase twice a day together with low dos@@ ed k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) were comparable ; the incidence of tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride and CP@@ K values observed in patients who received ast@@ er@@ ase along with low dos@@ ed k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r were very common .
in case of over@@ dosing , the patient is to observe signs of an intoxic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) , if necessary , necessary suppor@@ tive measures can be initiated .
Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active center of the HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and thereby prevents the process of viral gene and g@@ ag pol@@ - pol@@ enta @-@ protein prec@@ urs@@ ors with the result of a formation of un@@ ripe , non @-@ infectious viral particles .
the an@@ tivi@@ ral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro for HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ konzentr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range from 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M with acute infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells .
the connection between the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r versus HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ pre@@ treated patients with currently approved fossi@@ ls / k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r doses - as with other k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ based treatment schemes with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described only rarely were observed .
in sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ pre@@ treated patients who received 700@@ m@@ g. Fos@@ am@@ ren@@ avi@@ r twice a day in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 study , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred up to week 48 , whereby 14 isol@@ ates could be gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined .
gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the 13 of 14 children in whom vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within the 59 , with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors of non @-@ untreated patients showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults .
L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , K@@ 20@@ R , V@@ 32@@ I , L@@ 33@@ F , E@@ 34@@ Q , M@@ 36@@ I , I@@ 50@@ V , I@@ 54@@ L / M / T / V , I@@ 54@@ L / M / T / V , I@@ 54@@ L / M / T / V , I@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / I , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , L@@ 90@@ M and I@@ 9@@ 3@@ L / M .
in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg of f@@ os@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) of patients treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors occurred in patients with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure over 96 weeks , following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or mut@@ ations :
gen@@ otyp@@ ical resistance testing based analysis systems can be used to estimate the activity of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r / k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ am@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , M@@ 36@@ I , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , M@@ 36@@ I , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in conjunction with increased phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance to f@@ os@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and a decreased lik@@ el@@ ihood of vi@@ ro@@ logical response ( resistance ) .
the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns may be subject to changes by additional data , and it is recommended to always consult the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests .
based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests Clinical vali@@ dated phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems can be used in combination with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to estimate the activity of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r / k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
companies that sell diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ical cut @-@ offs ( separation points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test .
each of these four with reduced sensitivity to amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns creates a certain cross @-@ resistance to k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved .
there are currently data about cross @-@ resistance between Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ am@@ ren@@ avi@@ r resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ pre@@ treated patients , in which a Fos@@ anti@@ virus @-@ containing scheme failed ( one of them showed resistance to Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 25 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 insul@@ ates ) , sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 insul@@ ates ) , sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 insul@@ ates ) and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r / k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 insul@@ ates ) .
conver@@ sely , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r retains its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; maintaining this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
the early departure of a promising therapy is recommended in order to limit the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations that can adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
the evidence of the effectiveness of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ised open study , in which patients treated with PI ( 100 mg twice daily ) and nucle@@ o@@ side alog@@ a ( N@@ R@@ TI ) or a standard of care ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with low dos@@ ed k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , &quot; received .
one hundred thre@@ es@@ core ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to a@@ gener@@ a , at least one PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 study .
the primary analysis assessed the non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of AP@@ V / k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in plasma after 16 weeks in plasma load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ sub@@ grade threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the evidence of the efficacy of un@@ bi@@ ased ast@@ er@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled studies involving 28@@ 8 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 had been pre @-@ treated with PI .
in the studies A@@ gener@@ ase was examined twice daily , 20 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
no low @-@ dose chi@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s agreed together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of the patients en@@ rolled in the study had a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 19 Based on this data , the expected benefit of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ bund@@ led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as@@ on@@ ase should be considered in the treatment optimisation of children treated with PI . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after oral administration , the medium duration ( T@@ max ) amounts to approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
50@@ 8 % higher , for C@@ max by 30 % lower , if k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal results in a 25 % decrease in AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimum concentration at the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) was unaffected by dietary intake , although the simultaneous intake of food influences the extent and rate of res@@ or@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be connected to a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of the blood circulation into the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease in the overall concentration of the active substance in the plasma , whereby the amount of un@@ bound am@@ pere @-@ avi@@ r representing the active part remains probably unchanged .
while absolute concentration of in@@ bound am@@ pere @-@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage share of the free active component fluctu@@ ates during the dosing interval in dependence on the overall drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State over the range of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , drugs that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 respectively or present a substrate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be administered with caution when given at the same time with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day , leads to similar daily amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r exposure just as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily .
Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is out of the solution 14 % less bio@@ availability than from the capsules ; therefore A@@ gener@@ ase Solution and A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not replac@@ eable on a milli@@ gram@@ m@@ basis .
the ren@@ al clearing of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also negli@@ gible , so the effect of ren@@ al dysfunction should be limited to the elimination of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these treatment schemes lead to amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r plasma levels similar to those obtained from healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day without the simultaneous administration of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies for carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas were used in male animals , which correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.8 @-@ fold ( rat ) of the exposure to humans , after twice daily administration of 1200 mg of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
however , there was little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings from the exposure data on humans , both from clinical studies and the therapeutic application .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vivo and in vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial cell reverse mut@@ ation tests , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel tests on rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations in human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes were neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and proven in clinical daily life by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
until now , no significant liver toxic@@ ity has been observed in patients , neither during the administration of A@@ gener@@ a nor after the end of treatment .
studies on toxic@@ ity in juven@@ iles that were treated at an age of 4 days showed high mortality in both the control animals and the animals treated with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in systemic plasma exposition , which lay significantly below ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than expected exposure under therapeutic dosage in humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mo@@ el@@ on@@ gation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed , which point to delayed development .
24 If ast@@ er@@ ase capsules are used without the intensi@@ fying addition of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( booster ) , higher doses of ast@@ er@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
con@@ current application should be treated with caution in patients with mild or mild liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines which may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under the supervision of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration .
a@@ gener@@ a should be set to 27 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % decrease in the AU@@ C by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
50@@ 8 % higher , whereas C@@ max decreases by 30 % if k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma achieved in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , but a close @-@ mes@@ hed monitoring is recommended , as the effectiveness and harm@@ lessness of this combination is not known .
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended since the exposure of both prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors would be low .
if these drugs are used together , caution is required ; thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be carried out as precise predic@@ tion of the effect of the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ a , a reduction in the dose of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin will be reduced to at least half of the recommended dose 31 although there are no clinical data available for this .

with simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with A@@ gener@@ a , increased control of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ulated R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
simultaneous administration of Or@@ th@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0,@@ 0@@ 35 mg eth@@ in@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1,0 mg nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dron ) led to an acceptance of the AU@@ C and C@@ min by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r by 22 % or more .
during pregnancy , this drug may be used only after careful weighing of the potential benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the ni@@ st@@ ination in the uter@@ us to the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during breast@@ feeding .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ a was studied in adults and in children over 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medications .
in case of over@@ dosing , the patient is to observe signs of an intoxic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) , if necessary , necessary suppor@@ tive measures can be initiated .
the an@@ tivi@@ ral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro for HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ konzentr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range from 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M with acute infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
conver@@ sely , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r retains its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; maintaining this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
based on this data , the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ bund@@ led &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should be considered in therapy optimisation of children treated with PI .
while absolute concentration of in@@ bound am@@ pere @-@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage share of the free active component fluctu@@ ates during the dosing interval in dependence on the overall drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State over the range of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , drugs that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 respectively or present a substrate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be administered with caution when given at the same time with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .

studies on toxic@@ ity in juven@@ iles that were treated at an age of 4 days showed high mortality in both the control animals and the animals treated with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these results suggest that the metabolism processes are not fully mature in juven@@ iles , so that Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z . )

the benefit of using k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase Solution was neither treated with PI @-@ treated patients nor with PI @-@ treated patients .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than from Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ a capsules and solution for taking on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base are not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
patients should , once they are able to swal@@ low the capsules , stop taking the solution ( see section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 28@@ 00 mg of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , as there is no dose recommendation for the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase solution for intake and low dos@@ ed k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination should be avoided in these patient populations .
although dosage adjustment for Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not considered necessary , an application of A@@ gener@@ ase is contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of high propylene gly@@ col@@ lagen , A@@ gener@@ ase is contra@@ indicated for use in infants and children under 4 years , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure .
con@@ current administration may lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of the metabolism of these medicines and may cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ( z ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ a or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of the HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of 47 of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under the supervision of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration .
a@@ gener@@ a should be set aside if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug @-@ 49 dependent factors , such as a prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
in hem@@ op@@ hili@@ c patients ( Type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase in hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ or@@ rho@@ sis occur .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % decrease in the AU@@ C by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
50@@ 8 % higher , whereas C@@ max decreases by 30 % if k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
con@@ current consumption with as@@ cor@@ ase can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and lead to side @-@ effects associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
based on data on 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ hibit@@ ors , Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am &apos;s significant higher plasma concentrations are expected after oral administration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
the potential risk for humans is not known . A@@ gener@@ ase solution to take @-@ in may not be applied during pregnancy based on possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us to the contained Prop@@ ylene gly@@ col ( see section 4.3 ) .
lac@@ t@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected in milk lac@@ tate , but it is not known whether Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r transl@@ ates into breast milk .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the ni@@ st@@ ination in the uter@@ us to the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in 55 body weight during breast@@ feeding .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ a was studied in adults and in children over 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medications .
many of these events have not been clari@@ fied whether they are in connection with taking A@@ gener@@ a or another medicine used for HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of underlying disease .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ pre@@ treated patients with currently approved fossi@@ ls / k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r doses - as with other k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ based treatment schemes with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described only rarely were observed .
the early departure of a 60 therapy is recommended in order to limit the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations that can adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 62 Based on this data , the benefit of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ bund@@ led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should be considered in therapy optimisation of children treated with PI . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be connected to a large ve@@ to volume as well as an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of the blood circulation into the tissue .
the underlying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
in systemic plasma exposition , which lay significantly below ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than expected exposure under therapeutic dosage in humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mo@@ el@@ on@@ gation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed , which point to delayed development .

the application frequency and duration of treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the condition to be treated : • Al@@ dar@@ a must be applied three times a week in case of small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas . • In case of small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , it is necessary to apply 3 times a week during one or two weeks of treatment .
before bed@@ time , apply the cream to the affected skin areas so that it remains sufficiently long ( about eight hours ) on the skin before it is washed off .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a plac@@ ebo ( same cream , but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies of 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks each .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also studied in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two studies , in which patients were treated for six weeks and Al@@ dar@@ a or plac@@ ebo had to be performed either daily or five times a week .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the tum@@ ours after 12 weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies on a total of 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than plac@@ ebo . • In the treatment of war@@ ts in the genital area , the full recovery rate in all four main studies was 15 % to 52 % in patients treated with plac@@ ebo , but only 3 % to 18 % in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . • The results of both studies on bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas showed a complete recovery rate of 66 % to 80 % in patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a compared to 0 % to 3 % in the plac@@ ebo group .
the most common side effects of al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application of cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .

the treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream continues until all visible tendencies in the genital or peri@@ anal area have disappeared , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
an interruption in the course of treatment described above should be considered when intense local inflammation reactions occur ( see section 4.4 ) or if an infection is observed in the treatment area .
if in follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period the treated l@@ esi@@ ons are only incomplete , another therapy should be started ( see section 4.4 ) .
if a dose has been om@@ itted , the patient should wear the cream as soon as he / she notices this and then continue with the usual therapy plan .
rub the i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in a thin layer and rub in the cleaned , infected skin area until the cream is completely absorbed .
there should be a balance between the benefit of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible wor@@ sen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease .
there should be a balance between the benefit of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft vs. host response .
in other studies , in which no daily pre@@ h@@ arity was performed , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis and a case with circumcision leading to circumcision were observed .
there is an increased risk of severe local skin irrit@@ ation when using i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in higher than the recommended doses ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ations were observed , which necess@@ itated a treatment and / or caused a temporary physical impairment .
in cases where such reactions oc@@ cured at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulties in ur@@ ination which necess@@ itated an emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area .
until now , no clinical experience has been available for the use of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream after treatment with other cut@@ aneous inj@@ ections in the genital and peri@@ anal area .
although limited data indicates an increased rate of event reductions in HIV positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od Creme has shown in this group of patients with regard to eliminating the cow@@ ards , however , a lower effectiveness .
the treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , nose , lips or hair approach has not been studied .
local skin reactions are frequent , but the intensity of these reactions usually decreases during therapy or the reactions form after completion of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream .
if it is necessary because of the patient &apos;s complaints or due to the sever@@ ity of the local skin reactions , a treatment break can be made for several days .
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
as there are currently no data available on long @-@ term cure rates of more than 36 months after treatment , other suitable forms of therapy should be considered in super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas .
there are no clinical experience in patients with recur@@ rent and previously treated BC@@ Cs , therefore the application is not recommended for pre @-@ treated tum@@ ours .
data from an open clinical study suggest that there is a lower lik@@ el@@ ihood of response to the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy in large tum@@ ours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) .
i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not studied for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or ears or on the lip area within the lip .
there are only very limited data on the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses in anatom@@ ical parts outside the face and scal@@ p .
the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose on the for@@ ear@@ ms and hands do not support the effectiveness of this application , therefore such an application is not recommended .
local skin reactions occur frequently , but these reactions usually decrease in intensity during therapy or go back after replacing the therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream .
if the local skin reactions cause severe discomfort to the patient or are very strong , the treatment may be exposed for a few days .
data from an open clinical study showed that patients with more than 8 active l@@ esi@@ ons showed a lower full cure rate than patients with less than 8 l@@ esi@@ ons .
due to immun@@ o @-@ stimulating properties , i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be used with caution in patients receiving immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .
animal studies show no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) .

the most common reported and possibly or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in connection with side effects in studies with three times weekly treatment were local reactions at the site of the treatment of hands ( 3@@ 3.@@ 7 % of patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
the most commonly reported and possibly or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in the related side effects include complaints at the application site with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
the results reported by 185 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ Creme treated patients from a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled Phase III clinical study are shown below .
the most common adverse event , probably or possibly with the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream application , was a response to the application site ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
the adverse events reported in plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled Phase III clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream treated patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose are listed below .
the clinical evidence estimated according to the test plan shows that in these plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with three times weekly treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream common skin reactions including er@@ y@@ thema ( 61 % ) , erosion ( 30 % ) , ex@@ c@@ ori@@ ation / leaves ( 23 % ) and o@@ e@@ dem@@ a ( 14 % ) came ( see section 4.4 ) .
the clinical evidence estimated according to the test plan shows that in these studies with five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream , severe er@@ y@@ thema ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and severe scar@@ ring and sal@@ ting ( 19 % ) occurred .
in clinical trials investigating the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of acute ker@@ ato@@ sis , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was determined with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area .
the in@@ adver@@ tent one @-@ time oral intake of 200 mg I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags , may cause nausea , vom@@ iting , headache , my@@ al@@ gia , and fever .
the clin@@ ically serious side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , consisted in hyp@@ ot@@ onia , norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous fluids .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tical examination , increasing systemic levels of alpha interfer@@ ons and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected after the topical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od .
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al phase 3 efficacy studies , it was shown that efficacy in a complete healing of the tendencies at an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment over 16 weeks of plac@@ ebo treatment is significantly superior .
in 60 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , the F@@ eig@@ ni@@ ces were complete ; this was the case with 20 % of the patients who treated plac@@ ebo ( 95 % CI ) :
a complete healing could be achieved at 23 % of 157 male patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , compared to 5 % of 161 treated with plac@@ ebo treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) :
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od with five @-@ time application per week over 6 weeks has been studied in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super@@ ficial BC@@ Cs with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
the data presented from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years showed that approximately 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.@@ 7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) &#93; of all patients treated clin@@ ically and stayed for 48 months .
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od with three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four week , treatment @-@ free period , was examined in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic records within a con@@ ti@@ gu@@ ous 25 c@@ m2 treatment area on the hair@@ y scal@@ p or in the face .
the one @-@ year data from two combined observation studies show a recur@@ r@@ ence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical treatment after one or two treatment periods .
the approved indications external tendencies , ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose and super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma do not occur in pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients and were therefore not investigated .
Al@@ dar@@ a cream was studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials on children aged 2 to 15 with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , plac@@ ebo n = 3@@ 13 ) .
the efficacy of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies in the dos@@ ages investigated ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or more )
a minimal systemic intake of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream by the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose was observed during the three times weekly application during 16 weeks .
the highest drug concentrations in ser@@ um at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and measured 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 n@@ g / ml in the face ( 12.@@ 5 mg , 1 disposable bags ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25@@ mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the calculated obvious half @-@ life time was about 10 times higher than the 2 @-@ hour half @-@ life after sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in a previous study ; this indicates an extended retention of the medicine in the skin .
the data on systemic exposure showed that the res@@ or@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was low after topical application on MC @-@ dise@@ ased skin of patients at the age of 6 - 12 years and comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose or super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study of der@@ mal toxic@@ ity in rats , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg of KG resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased mil@@ z @-@ weight ; a study carried out for the der@@ mal application for four months resulted in no similar effects in the mouse .
a two @-@ year study of carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice on three days a week did not indu@@ ce tum@@ ours on the application .
the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ agen , there is a risk for humans to be regarded as very low due to systemic exposure .
the tum@@ ors occurred in the group of mice treated with the agent @-@ free cream , earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR .

the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary metabolic disorders .
the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place in a hospital or a hospital with res@@ us@@ c@@ itation equipment , and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to administration to prevent an allergic reaction .

the study mainly investig@@ ates the safety of the drug , but it also measured its effectiveness ( by examining its effect on reducing the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) .
in children under the age of five , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me lowered the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the children treated had a normal large liver at the end of the study .
the most common side effects of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) include headache , nausea , abdominal pain , rash , ar@@ th@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in the limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat feeling , fever and reactions at the in@@ fusion site .
very common side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement of lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will check every year all new information that may be known , and where necessary update this summary .
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will observe patients who receive al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with regard to the reactions to the in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. for the marketing of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in the entire European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ i@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O mam@@ mal cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ vary , ov@@ ary of the Chinese ham@@ ster ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme replacement therapy in patients with confirmed diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) .
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary metabolic diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver in@@ suffici@@ ency was not determined , and no dosage intake can be recommended for these patients .
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which are defined as any side effect occurring during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical environment in which re@@ vit@@ alization facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are immediately available .
due to the clinical phase 3 study , it is expected that nearly all patients form Ig@@ G antibodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
since there is little experience regarding the resum@@ ption of treatment after a longer break , it has to be cau@@ ti@@ ously avoided due to the theore@@ tically elevated risk of hyper@@ sensitivity reaction after an interruption of the treatment .
60 minutes before starting the in@@ fusion with medication ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ tics ) to minimize the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
in case of a slight or moderate in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be weigh@@ ed and / or a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to half the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
in case of a single , severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered .
the in@@ fusion rate can be resum@@ ed with a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) and a reduction of in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the preceding reaction occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be applied simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ ine or proc@@ aine , because there is a potential risk of interference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular absorption of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
animal experimental studies do not suggest direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
since there are no data on new@@ bor@@ ns exposed to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase via breast milk , it is recommended not to breast@@ feed during the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
adverse events in clinical trials were predominantly treated as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions , which were observed in 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( duration of up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , observed during the phase 3 study and its extension in a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older with a treatment duration of up to 4 years , are listed in the following table according to the following frequency : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ induced involvement of upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre@@ history , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respiratory failure and facial o@@ e@@ dem@@ a ( see section 4.4 ) .
children Un@@ desirable Drug Inter@@ actions related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 trial with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years , with predominantly severe cross @-@ term and treatment duration up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
intraven@@ ous 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
in most patients it occurred within 3 months from the beginning of the treatment to a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version , with the patients aged under 5 years with a more severe form of decay ( average after 26 days versus 45 days in patients aged 5 years and older ) .
until the end of the phase 3 study ( or until a premature exit from the study ) , no antibodies ( R@@ IP ) as@@ say were detected in 13 / 45 patients , including 3 patients with whom it never had been converted to ser@@ o@@ con@@ version .
patients with a lack of low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , while patients with high antibody ti@@ tr@@ es had a variable decrease of G@@ AG in urine .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one phase 2 study ) showed a marginal until low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ing effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase activity in vitro which did not appear to affect the clinical effectiveness and / or the reduction of G@@ AG in urine .
the presence of antibodies did not seem to be associated with the incidence of adverse drug reactions , although the incidence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reason for the enzyme replacement therapy is one of the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated medium and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient enzyme activity .
after intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly removed from circulation and absorbed by cells into the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely about male @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were studied in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study of 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , which showed the entire disease spectrum , the majority of patients were from the mean phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( Fe@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the efficacy were the percentage change of the expected Fe@@ V and the absolute walking distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study where they received 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me for another 3,5 years ( 182 weeks ) each week .
after 26 weeks of therapy , the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me showed an improvement in lung function and mobility , which is shown in the following table .
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and 182 weeks in the plac@@ ebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as highlighted in the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage of Fe@@ V is clin@@ ically not significant over this period and the absolute pul@@ mon@@ ary volumes increased in proportion to the children &apos;s body size .
of the 26 patients with a H@@ ep@@ nuclear fis@@ her before treatment 22 ( 85 % ) reached normal liver size until the end of the study .
within the first 4 weeks there was a clear decrease in the G@@ AG mirror in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine ) , which remained constant until the end of the study .
with regard to the hetero@@ geneous disease manifestation between patients , which was taken into account by using a combined repository , the clin@@ ically significant changes across five efficacy variables ( anticipated percentage of normal Fe@@ V , distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk , range of movement of the shoulder joint A@@ HI and visual acuity ) , was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deterioration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a one @-@ year open phase 2 study was conducted , primarily for the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in 20 patients who were under 5 years old at the time of their inclusion in the study ( 16 patients with severe form and 4 with mean arter@@ ial form ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to increased G@@ ag@@ - M@@ irr@@ ors in the urine in week 22 .
in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) were determined according to the Z @-@ Score for this age group The younger patients with the severe cross @-@ course ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean progression @-@ form showed normal mental development speed , whereas in older patients with severe cross @-@ course only limited or no advances in cognitive development were observed .
in a phase 4 study , studies on the pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dosing schemes were performed on the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute sal@@ v@@ age test .
intraven@@ ous 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent a justi@@ fiable alternative in patients experiencing difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing schemes is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the features of the medicine will be updated .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients under 5 years of age was similar to that of older and less severely affected patients .
based on conventional research on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in a unique ability , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration and reproduction toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not detect any particular dangers to humans .
since no compatibility studies have been carried out , this medicine may not be mixed with other medicines , except for those listed under 6.@@ 6 .
if the ready @-@ to @-@ use preparation is not used immediately , it is no longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C - 8@@ º C if the di@@ lution was done under controlled and vali@@ dated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions .

within the given time , the holder of the marketing authorization has to complete the following program , whose results form the basis for the annual evaluation report on the benefit @-@ risk relationship .
this tab will include long @-@ term safety and efficacy information on patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , as well as data on the natural progression of the disease in patients without this treatment .
in patients suffering from M@@ PS I , an enzyme called α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase , which spl@@ its certain substances in the body ( gly@@ cos@@ amin@@ og@@ ly@@ can@@ e ) , is either low in quantity or this enzyme is missing completely .
if you are allergic ( hyper@@ sensitive ) to any of the ingredients of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me or if you have an allergic reaction to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
an in@@ fusion @-@ conditioned reaction is any side effect occurring during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4 , &quot; What side effects are possible &quot; ) .
when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with other medicines please inform your doctor if you are taking drugs that contain chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ ine or proc@@ aine , because there is a possible risk of dimin@@ ished action of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken medicines , including non @-@ prescription medicines .
instructions for the handling - di@@ lution and application The concentrate to manufacture an in@@ fusion solution must be dil@@ uted before the application and is intended for intraven@@ ous use ( see information for physicians and medical personnel ) .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes by a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
in some patients with severe MRI @-@ related involvement of upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre@@ history , however , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respiratory failure and facial o@@ e@@ dem@@ a .
very common ( occurrence with more than 1 out of 10 patients ) : • headache • nausea : abdominal pain • rash joint , joint pain , back pain , pain in arms and legs • increased pulse • hyper@@ tension • less oxygen in the blood • Re@@ action at the in@@ fusion place

preparation of the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in@@ fusion ( using as@@ ep@@ tic technique ) • Dep@@ ending on the body weight of the individual patient , first determine the number of diar@@ rhe@@ a bottles to be dil@@ uted .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another medicine for cancer ) in patients who have not received chemotherapy ( drugs against cancer ) and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( malign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) or is likely to spread easily to other parts of the body . • advanced or metastatic &quot; non @-@ small &quot; lung cancer that does not affect the plate epitheli@@ al cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used as sole therapy for patients who have not previously been treated in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chem@@ o@@ therapies .
to reduce side effects , the patients should receive a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fol@@ ate ( a vitamin ) and inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , a &quot; anti @-@ medicine &quot; ( medicine against vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent a lack of fluids ) should be given before or after the addition of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients whose blood image changes or where certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed , stopped or the dose is reduced .
the active form of tel@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed thus slow@@ s the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from dividing .
the transformation of tel@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed into its active form goes more easily in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the medicine and a longer period of time in cancer cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a major study of 4@@ 56 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta were compared in a study to 5@@ 71 patients with advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy , with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another medicine against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ abine ( another drug against cancer ) , both in combination with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin lived an average of 12.@@ 1 months , compared to 9,@@ 3 months in the sole administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta was 8.@@ 3 months compared to 7.@@ 9 months in doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
in both studies , however , patients with cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous cell cells during administration of A@@ lim@@ ta rather than with the comparison medicine .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Eli Lil@@ ly Ne@@ der@@ land B.@@ V. for the marketing of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union .
each water bottle must be dissolved with 4.@@ 2 ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary dosage is taken from the bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.@@ 6 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is shown in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell carcin@@ oma ( see section 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with cross @-@ cell treatment of advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface area ( KO@@ F ) is administered as an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as an in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of the tel@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small cell carcin@@ oma after previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
in order to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid should be given on the day before and on the day of the tel@@ emet@@ ry application as well as on the day after the treatment .
during the seven days before the first dose of tel@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed , at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued throughout the therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose .
patients must also receive an in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 mc@@ g ) in the week before the first tel@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed dose and after every third treatment cycle .
in patients receiving tel@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed , a complete blood pattern should be created before each administration , including a differentiation of leu@@ k@@ oc@@ ytes and th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te counting .
alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Alan@@ ine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ GP@@ T ) should be ≤ 3 times higher than the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose check must take place taking into consideration the n@@ adi@@ r of the blood image or the maximum non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the preceding treatment cycles .
after recovery , patients must be treated according to the indications in the tables 1 , 2 and 3 which are applicable for A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC Grad 2 bleeding .
should patients develop non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ degrees 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be interrupted until the patient receives the value before treatment
treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be abor@@ ted if a hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity degree 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - continued in the occurrence of Grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical studies have no indication that in patients at the age of 65 years or over the age of 65 , there is an increased side effect risk .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy .
in clinical trials patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing of ≥ 45 ml / min were not necessary dos@@ ages which go beyond the dose adjustments recommended for all patients .
the data layer in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing of less than 45 ml / min was insufficient ; therefore , the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a function restriction of &gt; 1.5 times the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin limit value and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; the 3.0 @-@ fold the upper limit value ( in the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not studied especially in studies .
patients need to be monitored with respect to bone mar@@ ker@@ age and can not be administered to patients before their absolute neut@@ rophi@@ l number has again reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ - cy@@ te count again a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te count and maximum non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity , as observed in the previous cycles of treatment ( see section 4.2 ) .
a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction of grade 3 / 4 ha@@ emat@@ ological and ni@@ th@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with grade 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was ob@@ sol@@ ete if a pre@@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
therefore , all patients treated with tel@@ emet@@ ry must be instructed to use fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic measure for reduction of treatment @-@ induced toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to medium ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clear@@ ances 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid simultaneous intake of non@@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti @-@ ph@@ log@@ is@@ tika ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds ) such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ s@@ ali@@ - cy@@ l@@ lic acid ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before therapy , 2 days after therapy using tel@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients , for whom therapy is provided with tel@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed , must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ life for at least 5 days before therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy using tel@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients with these events had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing high blood pressure or diabetes .
therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space a drainage of the eff@@ usion is to be considered before the tel@@ emet@@ ry treatment .
5 main cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials with tel@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed when this substance was usually given in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance .
for this reason the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ated live vaccine ( except yellow fever , this vaccine is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of an ir@@ reversible reduction of the reproductive ability by means of tel@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed , men should be advised before the treatment course in order to obtain advice regarding the sperm con@@ serving .
in patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high doses of non@@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti @-@ ph@@ log@@ is@@ tics ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid can lead to a reduced amount of tel@@ emet@@ ry with the result of increased occurrence of side effects .
caution must therefore be taken if patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearance ≥ 80 ml / min ) can be used in high doses of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid can be avoided at a high dosage for at least 2 days before therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy using tel@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.4 ) .
since there are no data regarding the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ life such as Pi@@ ro@@ x@@ x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application with tel@@ emet@@ ry must be avoided for at least 5 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with tel@@ emet@@ re@@ - mixed .
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the co@@ ag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for the use of tel@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed in pregnant women , but as for an@@ de@@ - re @-@ timet@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites severe birth defects are expected in pregnancy .
tel@@ emet@@ ric @-@ mixed must not be used during pregnancy except if necessary - demanding and after careful weighing of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) .
since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage to the reproductive ability is made by tel@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed , men should be advised prior to the commen@@ cement of treatment to obtain advice regarding the sperm con@@ serving .

the primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients receiving investig@@ ational medicines ( random@@ ized and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of the clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) in connection with the malign@@ ant ple@@ ural tip was shown in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the ultrasound examination arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .
the differences between the two treatment arms showed an improvement in lung function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and a deterioration in lung function over time in the control arm .
a multic@@ entre , random@@ ised , open phase III study with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el in patients with locally advanced or metastatic N@@ SC@@ LC after prior chemotherapy had a medi@@ an survival time of 8.@@ 3 months in patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( Int@@ ent to treat Population n = 28@@ 3 ) and of 7.@@ 9 months treated with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el treated patients ( IT@@ T n = 28@@ 8 ) .

it is used in obes@@ e adults with a body mass index ( Body Mass Index - BM@@ I ) ≥ 28 kg per square meter in combination with low @-@ calorie , fat @-@ reduced nutrition .
patients who take All@@ i and unable to lose weight after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if these enzymes are in@@ hibited , they can &apos;t break down some fats in the food , causing about a quarter of the fats which are associated with food un@@ di@@ gest@@ ed the intest@@ ines .
in a third study All@@ i was compared with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with plac@@ ebo in 3@@ 91 overweight patients .
in both studies of patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who took All@@ i 60 mg achieved an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg after one year , compared to 2,3 kg when taking plac@@ ebo .
in the study with All@@ i in patients with BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no weight loss could be observed for patients .
the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily stain@@ s on anus , fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with chair passage , fa@@ eces , gre@@ asy / o@@ ily stools , leaving o@@ ily ch@@ err@@ s ( rot@@ ting ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs .
it must not be used in patients treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent transplan@@ t rejection ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
furthermore , it must not be used in patients suffering from a long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( in which insufficient nutrients are taken from the digestive tract ) or to cholest@@ ase ( liver disease ) , and in pregnant or nursing mothers .
in July 2007 , the European Commission granted the Gla@@ xo Group Limited its approval for placing Or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K in the entire European Union .
all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight ( Body @-@ Mass Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ ic , fat @-@ reduced diet .
all@@ i should not be used by children and adolescents under 18 because there is insufficient data on efficacy and safety .
however , since or@@ list@@ at is only minim@@ ally absorbed , no adjustment of the dosage is necessary for elderly people and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function .

the probability of occurrence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) can increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich individual meal or fat @-@ rich diet .
as weight reduction in diabetes can be associated with improved metabolic control , patients who use a medicine for diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a treatment with all@@ i because the dosage of the anti@@ di@@ ab@@ etic should be adjusted if necessary .
patients who take all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage of these drugs needs to be adjusted .
it is recommended to take additional pregnancy prevention measures in order to prevent the possible failure of oral contrac@@ eption in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see section 4.5 ) .
a reduction of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma levels was observed in a study on interactions of medicines as well as in several cases with simultaneous use of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
when applying war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick values ( internationally normal@@ ised ratio , IN@@ R ) could be affected ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in most patients treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials up to 4 full years , the levels of vitamins A , D , E and K and beta car@@ ot@@ ins remained in the normal range .
however , patients should be advised to take supplementary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time to ensure adequate vitamin absorption ( see section 4.4 ) .
after the addition of a single dose of A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , a marginal decrease in A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration was observed with a limited number of healthy volunteers who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time .
animal experimental studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal nature and are associated with the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug , as the absorption of bi@@ ased fat is prevented .
gastro@@ intestinal side effects were determined from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary .
the abund@@ ances are defined as follows : very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data is not inv@@ alu@@ able ) .
the incidence of known side @-@ effects found after the launch of or@@ list@@ at has not been known , as these events were voluntarily reported by a population of lesser magnitude .
† It is plau@@ sible that the treatment with all@@ i can lead to anxiety regarding possible or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days in normal and obes@@ e subjects without significant clinical findings .
in the majority of cases reported after the launch of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dose , either side effects or similar side effects were reported as for the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on human and animal studies , rapid reg@@ ression of any systemic effects attributed to the li@@ very inhibit@@ ing properties of or@@ list@@ at can be assumed .
the therapeutic effect begins in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine by co@@ valent bonding to the active ser@@ ine rest of the ga@@ stri@@ c and p@@ ank@@ re@@ atic li@@ pas@@ es .
from clinical studies it was derived that 60 mg or@@ list@@ at was taken three times a day , the absorption of about 25 % of the dietary fat was blocked .
two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies in adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 prove the effectiveness of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ ic , fat @-@ reduced diet .
the primary parameter , the change in body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of random@@ ization ) , was evaluated as follows : as a change in body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as a percentage of those study participants who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) .
although weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months .
the average dietary change in the Gesamt@@ cholest@@ erin was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( initial value 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with plac@@ ebo + 2.8 % ( initial value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change in LD@@ L cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % with or@@ list@@ at ( bas@@ eline 3.3 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and plac@@ ebo + 3.8 % ( initial value 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
at the waist circum@@ ference , the average change was -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( initial value 10@@ 3.@@ 7 cm ) and with plac@@ ebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( initial value 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non @-@ metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ urable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 n@@ g / ml ) .
7 In general , non @-@ metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in plasma could only be detected spor@@ adic@@ ally and in extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 n@@ g / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of an accumulation .
in a study with obes@@ e patients the minimal systemic res@@ or@@ bi@@ ased dose was administered , two main met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ sed Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 according to the cle@@ av@@ age of the N @-@ form@@ yl @-@ leu@@ c@@ ine group ) , were identified , which represented approximately 42 % of the total plasma concentration .
based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , can@@ did @-@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data makes no special danger to humans .

please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice any side effects that are not stated in this information .
the most common side effects are associated with the effect of the capsules and result in increased fat from the body .
these side effects usually occur within the first weeks of treatment , as you may have not consistently reduced the fat percentage in your diet .
with the following basic rules , you can learn to minimize the diet @-@ related accompanying symptoms : • Start already a few days , or better a week before taking the capsules with a fat @-@ reduced diet . • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and about the size of the portions that you normally consume .
if you know exactly how much you eat , the lik@@ el@@ ihood that you exceed your fat limit decreases . • Distri@@ bute your recommended amount of fat evenly on daily meals .
save the amount of calories and fat that you are allowed to take per meal , not to take it in the form of a high @-@ fat main dish or a substantial post @-@ table as you might have done in other programs for weight reduction . • Most people who experience these symptoms will learn to control them with time by adjusting their diet .
• Ke@@ ep out of reach of children . • Do not use all@@ i after the exp@@ ir@@ ation date stated on the box . • Do not keep container tightly closed to protect the contents from moisture . • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with si@@ lica gel that serve to keep the capsules dry .

a lasting weight loss , for example by improving nutrition and more exercise , can prevent the emergence of serious diseases and has a positive effect on your health .
choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients and gradually learn to eat heal@@ th@@ ily .
energy is also measured in kilo@@ j@@ oules , which you also find in food packaging . • The recommended calorie intake indicates how many calories you should consume maximum per day .
keep in mind the tables below . • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat that you should take with each meal .
the amount of calories provided for you can be found in the information below , which is suitable for you . • Due to the action of the capsule , compliance with the recommended fat intake is decisive .
if you take the same amount of fat as before , this can mean that your body cannot handle this amount of fat .
by adher@@ ing to the recommended fat intake , you can maximize weight loss while at the same time reduce the lik@@ el@@ ihood of diet @-@ related accompanying symptoms . • You should try to decline gradually and continuously .
34 This reduced calorie intake should allow you to gradually lose weight approximately 0.5 kg per week without developing frustr@@ ations and dis@@ appointments .
the more active you are , the higher your recommended calorie intake . • &quot; Low physical activity &quot; means that you burn only little or no , stairs , work in the garden or do other physical activities daily . • &quot; Medium @-@ physical activity &quot; means that you can burn 150 k@@ cal every day , i.e. 3 km walking , 30@@ - to 45 @-@ minute garden work or 2 km running in 15 minutes .

Alo@@ xi is used in chem@@ o@@ therapies , which cause nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as in chem@@ o@@ therapies , the moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be increased by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a drug that can be used as an anti @-@ method ) .
the use in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended as there is not enough information about the effects in this age group .
this means that the substance inhi@@ bits the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines .
in three main studies , Alo@@ xi was studied at 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chemotherapy , which are strong or moderate for nausea and vom@@ iting .
in chem@@ o@@ therapies , the severe trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi had no vom@@ iting in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 132 of 2@@ 23 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 2@@ 21 ) .
in chem@@ o@@ therapies , the moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting showed 81 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi , in the 24 hours after chemotherapy not vom@@ iting ( 153 of 18@@ 9 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) .
in comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission granted approval for the marketing of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union to the company Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd .
Alo@@ xi is indicated : to prevent acute nausea and vom@@ iting for highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer and to prevent nausea and vom@@ iting in moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi for the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting , which is induced by a strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy can be enhanced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given prior to chemotherapy .
since pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the col@@ on , patients with an@@ am@@ ne@@ sty ob@@ sti@@ pation or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us after injection should be closely monitored .
however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , caution is required with simultaneous administration of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with the Q@@ T interval or tend to such an extension .
besides chemotherapy , Alo@@ xi is not intended to be used for prevention or treatment of nausea and vom@@ iting in the days following chemotherapy .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not inhi@@ bit the activity of the five chem@@ o@@ therapeutic agents examined against tum@@ ours ( c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ tar@@ ab@@ in , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in and mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) .
a clinical trial showed no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a single dose of intraven@@ ous Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady St@@ ate@@ - Con@@ centr@@ ation of oral met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ ami@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population , it was shown that the simultaneous administration of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( am@@ o@@ dar@@ one , c@@ elec@@ oxi@@ b , chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ zin , c@@ im@@ eti@@ dine , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , re@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in , ox@@ et@@ ine , re@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in , ox@@ et@@ ine , ser@@ tr@@ aline and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ ine ) had no significant effect on the clearing of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experience in the use of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ an@@ cies is not present , so Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the treating physician .
clinical trials were the most common side effects of 250 mc@@ g. of observed adverse events ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , possibly associated with Alo@@ xi , headache ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ pation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions at the site ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing reports .
in the group with the highest dosage similar frequencies of adverse events as in the other dosing groups showed ; there were no dose @-@ action @-@ relationships to observe .
di@@ aly@@ sis studies have not been performed , but due to the large distribution volume a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not an effective therapy with an Alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dose .
in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients who received moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide ( half @-@ life time : 7.@@ 3 hours ) were given that given day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one intraven@@ ously .
in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study , a total of 6@@ 67 patients who received a strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ zin and 250 or 750 mc@@ g. of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared with patients who received 32 mg of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron which were given intraven@@ ously on day 1 .
results of studies with moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study of highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summari@@ zed in the following tables .
in clinical trials of indication chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron effects were comparable to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ t@@ c interval with the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
after clinical investigations , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ lic@@ ar@@ isation and extend the duration of the action potential .
the aim of the study carried out in 2@@ 21 healthy volunteers was the assessment of the EC@@ G effects of intraven@@ ous pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
after IV administration , an initial decrease in plasma concentrations follows a slow elimination of the body with an average terminal half @-@ life of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area below the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally dose @-@ related in whole dose range of 0,@@ 3- 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients .
following intraven@@ ous pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean ( ± SD ) increase of the pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration measured at 42 ± 34 % was observed between day 1 and day 5 .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simulations suggest that at once daily intraven@@ ous dose of 0.@@ 25 mg pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable to a value measured after a one @-@ off intraven@@ ous dose of 0.@@ 75 mg ; however , the C@@ max was higher after the exposure of 0.@@ 75 mg .
approximately 40 % are eliminated by the kidneys and approximately 50 % are converted into two primary met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites , which compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron over less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .
in vitro studies on metabolism we have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , to a lesser extent , are involved in the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 on the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elimination Accor@@ ding to an intraven@@ ous dose of 10 mc@@ g / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , about 80 % of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as an unchanged ingredient made about 40 % of the given dose .
after a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous injection of healthy dogs , the total corpor@@ al amounts for 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al clearing was 53 ± 29 ml / min .
although patients with severe liver dys@@ functions increase the terminal elimination stage and the average systemic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , however , a reduction of the dose is not justified .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions , which are considered to be sufficient above the maximum human therapeutic exposure , suggest@@ ing low relevance for clinical use .
10 out of prec@@ lin@@ ical studies evidence suggests that pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations , which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and re@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and can pro@@ long the duration of action .
high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded in approximately 30 times of therapeutic exposure to humans ) , which were given daily over two years , led to increased incidence of liver tum@@ ours , en@@ doc@@ rine Ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid gland , p@@ itu@@ itary , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al mar@@ es ) and skin tum@@ ours in rats , but not mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dos@@ ages used and since Alo@@ xi is intended for one @-@ off application , the relevance of these results is low for humans .
the European Commission must inform the European Commission on the purpose of placing the drug approved as part of this decision .

in June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative report recommended by Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution for the treatment of the medicines intended for the treatment of hepatitis C .
this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should resem@@ ble a biological medicinal product called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same drug that is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; reference medicines &quot; ) .
al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease called by a viral infection ) .
in a micro@@ scopic examination the liver tissue damages damage , and the values of the liver enzyme Alan@@ ine am@@ otran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) in the blood ab@@ normally are increased .
it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced to stimulate the formation of the active substance .
the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon presented data that demonstrate the comparison of al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( drug structure , composition and purity of the medicine , mode of action , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) .
in the study of hepatitis C patients the efficacy of al@@ ph@@ eon was compared with the efficacy of the reference drug to 4@@ 55 patients .
the study measured how many patients responded to the medication after 12 of a total of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after treatment ( i.e. no symptoms of the virus in the blood ) .

in addition , concerns were reported that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed would not suff@@ ice .
the number of patients with hepatitis C , responding to the treatment with al@@ ph@@ eon and ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar in the clinical study .
after the treatment with al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease wor@@ sen@@ ed again in more patients than with the reference drug product ; Al@@ ph@@ eon also had more side effects .
apart from this , the test used in the study to investigate the question of how far the drug acts as an immune response ( i.e. the body produces antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) are not adequately vali@@ dated .
it can be used for the treatment of im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( skin infection accompanied by cr@@ ust formation ) and small infected in@@ fir@@ mary ( crack or cuts ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ w@@ ed wounds .
al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections that have been proven or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lin@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ con may not work against this type of infection .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be applied in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years of age , the area to be treated must not exceed 2 % of the body &apos;s surface .
if the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced ) and inhi@@ bits the growth of the bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was cleared after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients under plac@@ ebo were responding to the treatment .
in the treatment of infected skin @-@ related patients , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : about 90 % of patients in both groups responded to the treatment .
in these two studies , however , it was found that Al@@ tar@@ go is not effective enough in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( frozen cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or of infections that have been proven or probably caused by MR@@ SA .
the most common side effect with al@@ tar@@ go ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) is a irrit@@ ation to the order .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the advantages of Al@@ tar@@ go were out@@ weigh@@ ed by the short @-@ term treatment of the following super@@ ficial skin infections : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small in@@ fir@@ mi@@ ties , abra@@ sions or se@@ w@@ ed wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission granted the company Gla@@ xo Group Ltd. to appro@@ ve the marketing of Al@@ tar@@ go across the European Union .
patients with no improvement within two to three days are to be examined and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
in the event of a sensi@@ tization or serious local irrit@@ ation by the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ino@@ Sal@@ be , the treatment should be stopped , the o@@ int@@ ment carefully wi@@ ped out and an appropriate alternative treatment of the infection is started .
retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ine should not be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known as patho@@ gen or suspected ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials of secondary un@@ infected open wounds the efficacy of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) was insufficient .
alternative therapy should be considered if there is no improvement or deterioration of the infected position after a 2 to 3 @-@ day treatment .
the effect of simultaneous use of retin@@ ec@@ ulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended .
due to the low plasma concentrations , which were achieved in humans after topical use on abra@@ ded skin or infected surface wounds , clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vivo is not expected ( see Section 5.2 ) .
3 After simultaneous oral administration of 2 times a day 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol , the middle ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ine AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max according to topical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be increased by 81 % following topical application of healthy adult men .
due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients , dose adjustments are not considered necessary if topical retention is applied during systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ hibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral intake and are inadequate in relation to a statement regarding the birth and the fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ine o@@ int@@ ment should only be used during pregnancy if a topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ino@@ a is prefer@@ able to the administration of a systemic antibiotic .
in deciding whether breast@@ feeding should be continued / terminated or continued therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go , it is necessary to weigh between the benefit of breast@@ feeding for the baby and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
in clinical trials of 2@@ 150 patients with super@@ ficial skin infections , which Al@@ tar@@ go have applied , the most commonly reported side effect was irrit@@ ation at the site that affects approximately 1 % of patients .
mode of action Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance which is isolated by fermentation from cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly P@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the mechanism of action of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective in@@ hibition of bacterial protein synthesis through interaction at a specific binding point of the 50 sub@@ unit of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ om , which differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicates that the binding site of ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L@@ 3 is involved and is located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P binding site and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase centre .
by binding on this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bits pep@@ tide transfer , block partial P @-@ binding @-@ interactions and prevent normal formation of active 50s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units .
if due to the local pre@@ val@@ ence of resistance the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin appears to be question@@ able at least some types of infection , a consultation should be as@@ pi@@ red by experts .
no differences were detected in in vitro activity of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ino@@ id versus S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ate were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in case of non @-@ response to treatment with S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tr@@ unks with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
res@@ or@@ ption In a healthy adult study 1 % retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ine o@@ int@@ ment was applied daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion to intact and reduced skin for up to 7 days .
of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice a day for treatment of secondary traum@@ atic wounds for 5 days , individual plasma samples were obtained .
the sampling was performed on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before medication and the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual systemic intake in humans after topical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment to 200 c@@ m2 of abra@@ ded skin ( C@@ max = 22 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 n@@ g · h / ml ) 6@@ 60 times lower than the retin@@ ap@@ am@@ iner IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP in@@ hibition .
metabolism The in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ino@@ ids in human liver micro@@ som@@ es was primarily medi@@ ated by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with small participation of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) .
in studies on oral toxic@@ ity of rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were carried out over 14 days , there were indications of adaptive liver and thy@@ roid gland changes .
in vitro examination of gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse @-@ lymph@@ oma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes and in the rat @-@ micro@@ kernel test for in @-@ vivo study of chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
there were neither male nor female rats symptoms of reduced fertility in oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , whereby one to 5 times higher exposure was achieved than the highest estimated exposure in humans ( topical application to 200 c@@ m2 of abra@@ ded skin ) :
in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study on rats , oral doses of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( according to ≥ 3 times the estimated human exposure ( see above ) , develop@@ mental toxic@@ ity ( reduced body weight of the fet@@ us and delayed oscill@@ ation ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity were determined .
the owner of the marketing authorization must ensure that a pharmaceutical vig@@ il@@ ance system , as presented in module 1.@@ 8.1 of the Application Con@@ tract ( version 6.2 ) is present and works before the product is marketed and as long as the marketed product is used .
the holder of the marketing authorization is obliged to carry out detailed studies and additional pharmaceutical vig@@ il@@ ance activities in the Pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan , as described in Version 1 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) , as well as all additional updates of R@@ MP , which are agreed with the CH@@ MP .
as described in the CH@@ MP &quot; Gui@@ deline on Risk Management Systems for Human Use , &quot; the updated R@@ MP should be submitted simultaneously with the next Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report .
for irrit@@ ation or other signs and symptoms at the treated spot , you should quit the application of Al@@ tar@@ go and talk to your doctor .
do not apply any other o@@ int@@ ments , cre@@ ams or lo@@ tions on the surface treated with Al@@ tar@@ go unless expressly prescribed by your doctor .
it must not be used in the eyes , on the mouth or on the lips , in the nose or in the female genital area .
if the o@@ int@@ ment is out of sight on one of these surfaces , wash the spot with water and ask your doctor for advice if discomfort occurs .
after applying the o@@ int@@ ment you can cover the affected area with a sterile dressing or a gaz@@ ing cover unless your doctor has advised you not to cover the surface .

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children between one and 15 years , which are not immune to these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is applied as part of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of two doses , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered .
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix can only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during the im@@ muni@@ zation and it is ensured that the vacc@@ ination plan existing from two doses can be completed .
if a ris@@ er dose is desirable against hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix or another hepatitis B or B vaccine can be given .
comb@@ ating vacc@@ ines by helping the immune system ( the natural def@@ ences of the body ) , as it can defend itself against a disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognizes the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; foreign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and creates antibodies against it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ambi@@ rix contains the same components as the vaccine Twin@@ rix grown @-@ up since 1996 and the vaccine Twin@@ rix used since 1997 .
the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , but Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are administered as part of a three @-@ dose vacc@@ ination plan .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data , which support the application of Twin@@ rix adults , were also used as evidence for the application of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration a month after the last injection .
in an additional study with 20@@ 8 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 month gap between the two inj@@ ections .
between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children Ambi@@ rix took a month after the last injection to develop protective antibody concentrations in hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ rix was similar to six months and a 12 month gap between the inj@@ ections .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed with more than 1 out of 10 vaccine doses ) are headache , lack of appetite , pain at the injection point , redness , mat@@ ch@@ iness ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , any of the other ingredients or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
in August 2002 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ c@@ als a.@@ s.@@ a. a permit for the marketing of Ambi@@ rix in the whole
the standardi@@ zation plan for pri@@ mers vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix is made up of two doses whereby the first dose is administered at the date of the election and the second dose between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a booster dose is desired both for hepatitis A and hepatitis B , vacc@@ ines or combination vacc@@ ines can be vacc@@ inated with the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
the anti @-@ hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) are based on the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
it is not yet fully secured whether immun@@ o@@ competent persons who have responded to hepatitis C vacc@@ ination need a booster shot as a protection since they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory for non @-@ det@@ ectable antibodies .
3 As with all injection vacc@@ ines , appropriate means of medical treatment and monitoring should be immediately available for the rare case of an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the application of the vaccine .
if a quick protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardi@@ zation scheme is recommended with the combination vaccine containing 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated Hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in the case of h@@ emo@@ di@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons suffering from disorders of the immune system , there may be no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody ( anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s ) so that in these cases the administration of additional vacc@@ ines can be necessary .
because an in@@ tra @-@ der@@ mal injection or in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular administration in the glut@@ eal muscles could lead to a sub@@ optimal result , these injection routes should be avoided .
however , in cases of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders , Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ an@@ ously as it can occur in these cases after in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular administration to bleeding .
if Ambi@@ rix was administered in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection , tet@@ anus , az@@ el@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis and Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type b vaccine ( D@@ T@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with a combined meas@@ ern@@ - m@@ um@@ my vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient ( see section 5.1 ) .
in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects it has to be assumed that an adequate immune response may not be achieved .
in a clinical study carried out with 3 doses of this formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ch@@ iness , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , headache and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in the earlier thi@@ om@@ int@@ - and preserv@@ ative @-@ containing vaccine formulation .
in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ inations were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to 15 years .
in a study of 300 participants aged 12 to 15 years , the compatibility of Ambi@@ rix was compared with that of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
the only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and mat@@ edness on a basis for calculation per vacc@@ ination dose Ambi@@ rix , but not based on a calculation basis per person .
pain was observed after the administration of Ambi@@ rix in 5@@ 0.@@ 7 % of the subjects , compared with 3@@ 9.1 % in the subjects after the administration of a dose of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
according to the complete vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of the subjects who had given Ambi@@ rix reported pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % in the test persons who had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
however , the frequency of mat@@ edness was comparable to each pro@@ band ( i.e. over the entire vacc@@ ination cycle with 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the subjects who received Ambi@@ rix , compared with 3@@ 6.2 % in the test persons who received the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine ) .
the incidence of severe pain and mat@@ ch@@ iness was low and comparable to the observed combination vaccine with the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme .
in a comparative study of 1 to 11 years , the incidence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ Group was comparable to that observed when administration with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine with a viral hepatitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in the 6@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix a more frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , was reported .
the percentage of in@@ oc@@ ulations that reported severe side effects during the 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ dose vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ activated Hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was statisti@@ cally not different .
in clinical trials conducted at the age of 1 to 15 years , Ser@@ o@@ arthritis rates for anti @-@ HA@@ V 9@@ 9.1 % were 1 month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second dose , per month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the Ser@@ o@@ arthritis rates for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4.2 % one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second dose , per month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study conducted at 12@@ - and including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 were awarded the standard combin@@ ation@@ sim@@ p with three doses .
in the 28@@ 9 people whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was worth@@ less , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher compared to hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after administration of the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix .
the immun@@ ological answers reached in a clinical comparative study at 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds after the completion of the full vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. in month 7 ) are listed in the following table .
in both studies , the vacc@@ ines received either a 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated Hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be detected for at least 24 months after im@@ muni@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 @-@ month vaccine .
the immune reaction observed in this study was similar to that observed after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses combined with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated H@@ ep@@ ati@@ te A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , it could be shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies can be compared 24 months after im@@ muni@@ zation in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme compared to the 0 @-@ 12 months vacc@@ ination scheme .
if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix in the second year of life was administered simultaneously with the refresh chim@@ e of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eria , tet@@ anus , az@@ el@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis and 8 Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type b vaccine ( D@@ T@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with the first dose of a combined meas@@ les m@@ um@@ my vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient .
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of current formulation for adults showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and ser@@ o@@ arthritis rates similar to previous formulation .
the vaccine is examined both before and after res@@ us@@ pen@@ ing to any foreign particles and / or physical visible changes .
according to article 114 of Directive 2001 / 83 / EC , state charge approval is carried out by a state laboratory or a laboratory authorised for this purpose .

the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted through viruses @-@ containing foods and beverages , but can also be transmitted by other means , such as bathing in waters contaminated by waste water .
you may feel very tired , have a dark urine , pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( ja@@ un@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may make hosp@@ ital@@ isation necessary .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix is not able to fully protect against infection with hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vacc@@ ination series has been completed with 2 doses .
if you / your child are already infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus prior to the administration of both vacc@@ ines Ambi@@ rix / is ( although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or feel sick at the moment of vacc@@ ination ) an in@@ oc@@ ulation may not prevent a disease .
protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those of hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection cannot be medi@@ ated .
• If you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any part of this vaccine , including Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) , if you have an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any part of this vaccine .
an allergic reaction can manifest through it@@ chy skin ras@@ hes , short@@ ness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue . • If you have an allergic reaction to a previous vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B , if you have a severe infection with fever .
• If you want to have a quick protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before the scheduled administration of the second in@@ oc@@ ulation ) .
at a potential risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the physician will advise you / your child from a vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix .
instead , he will recommend 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis B / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective H@@ CV ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated Hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ) .
the second in@@ oc@@ ulation of this vaccine with reduced content of effective components is usually given a month after the first dose and is likely to give you a vacc@@ ination protection before the end of the vacc@@ ination series .
sometimes Ambi@@ rix is inj@@ ected in persons suffering from severe blood cl@@ ots , under the skin and not inj@@ ected into the muscle . • If you / your child are weakened due to illness or treatment in your / her body &apos;s defense / or if you / your child undergo a hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis / sub@@ tract .
Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to the vacc@@ ination can not be sufficient so that a blood test can be required to see how strongly the reaction is to the vaccine .
21 Tell your doctor if you / your child take other medicines / takes ( including those you can get without prescription ) or if you / your child has been vacc@@ inated / / or has been planned or planned in the near future .
however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine has to be given simultaneously with Ambi@@ rix , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate areas and as different extre@@ mi@@ ties as possible .
if Ambi@@ rix is to be given at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will nonetheless be sufficient .
normally , Ambi@@ rix will not be given pregnant or breast@@ feeding women , unless it is urgent that they are vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B .
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
if you miss the agreed date for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible .
♦ very common ( more than 1 case per 10 missed doses ) : • pain or discomfort on the spot or redness • Mat@@ eness • irrit@@ ability • headache • lack of appetite

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
on the basis of data known since obtaining the first approval for placing on the market , the CH@@ MP advoc@@ ated that the benefit @-@ risk relationship for Ambi@@ rix remains positive .
however , since Ambi@@ rix was brought into circulation only in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this medicine is limited due to the low patient exposure .
am@@ mon@@ y can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with in@@ complete enzyme defect or hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre@@ history .
Am@@ mon@@ schn@@ aps is divided into several individual doses at meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed with food or administered via a gastro@@ po@@ stom@@ er tube ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach &apos;s leading tube ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose into the stomach of leading tube ) .
it was not a comparative study since Am@@ mon@@ y could not be compared with another treatment or plac@@ ebo ( a pseu@@ do medicine , i.e. without active substance ) .
Am@@ mon@@ y can also result in loss of appetite , a abnormal acid content in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , f@@ ain@@ ting , fluid retention , taste disturbances or taste sa@@ p , abdominal pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ pation , skin rash , unpleasant body odor or weight gain .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Am@@ mon@@ y effectively prevented ammon@@ ia levels in patients with urine flow disorders .
Am@@ mon@@ y was approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; because only limited information on this drug was available due to the condition of the disease at the time of admission .
the use is indicated in all patients with a complete enzyme shortage already manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with a late mani@@ f@@ le form ( incomplete enzyme defect that mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first month of life ) there is an indication for the use when hyper@@ metrop@@ ic en@@ cephal@@ opathy is present in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
for infants , for children who are unable to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form .
the daily dose is calculated individually taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake of the patient needed for growth and development .
according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults .
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early deficiency of Car@@ bam@@ bin@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ eth@@ in@@ tran@@ scar@@ path@@ ia .
patients with ar@@ gin@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency have to receive ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be given to patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing , as there is a risk for the formation of o@@ es@@ oph@@ ag@@ ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , respectively 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
therefore , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency as well as with sodium retention and o@@ dem@@ a formation .
since metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate takes place over the liver and kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used with extreme care in patients with liver or ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
the importance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in the sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , there was a slow@@ down of the ne@@ ural prolifer@@ ation and increased loss of neur@@ ons .
there was also a delayed mat@@ ur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and reduced number of functioning nerve end@@ ings in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted in humans into breast milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during the lac@@ tation period ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS at least 56 % of patients had at least an un@@ desirable event ( AE ) and 78 % of these adverse events were assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an eigh@@ teen @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in connection with lac@@ tate dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , bul@@ bar top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
a case of over@@ dosing occurred in a 5 @-@ month @-@ old inf@@ ant with an accidental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms begin with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity in intraven@@ ous doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabolic active compound , con@@ ju@@ gated by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , which is ex@@ cre@@ ted via the kidneys .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that for each gram of a sodium phen@@ yl@@ ate between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine can be produced .
it is important that diagnosis is early and the treatment is started immediately in order to improve survival and clinical outcome .
the pro@@ g@@ nosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the occurrence of early symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ aust , and the disease even led to death in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free analog@@ a within the first year of life .
due to hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative methods of nitrogen separation ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced diet and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate new@@ born at post@@ part@@ al ( but within the first life month ) to 80 % .
patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and who were already treated before the first appearance of hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy was 100 % survival , but even with these patients it was time with many mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its .
patients with a late @-@ manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ous form of the Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ Tran@@ scar@@ path@@ ian deficiency ) , which recovered from hyper@@ metrop@@ ic en@@ cephal@@ opathy and treated last@@ ingly with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate and a protein @-@ reduced diet , was 98 % survival .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible in the treatment and a further deterioration of neuro@@ logical condition can occur in some patients .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ ju@@ gated by glut@@ amine in the liver and kidneys , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined after a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in metabolism and with repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( un@@ controlled trials ) .
the behavior of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients after IV administration of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral individual dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate in tablet form 15 minutes after taking measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate were determined .
in the majority of patients with ure@@ a @-@ cycl@@ ine disorders or hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in opath@@ ies , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) could not be detected the next morning after noc@@ tur@@ nal fasting .
in three out of six patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis that were repeatedly treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) , the mean phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations were five times higher on the third day than after the first gifts .
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted within 24 hours to about 80 @-@ 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gated product Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
following the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test , sodium @-@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate had no obvious effects with toxic and non @-@ toxic cans ( examination 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate is given either or@@ ally ( infants and children who can not swal@@ low pills or patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or via a gastro@@ po@@ stom@@ ia or a nas@@ al probe .
according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range .
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early deficiency of Car@@ bam@@ bin@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ eth@@ in@@ tran@@ scar@@ path@@ ia .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5.4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium poly@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , respectively 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
if rat @-@ fl@@ utes were exposed before the birth phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabolism of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ) , there were l@@ esi@@ ons in the pyr@@ amid@@ al cells of the cor@@ tex .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an eigh@@ teen @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in connection with lac@@ tate dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , bul@@ bar top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess .
on the basis of tests on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , it can be assumed that for each gram of a sodium phen@@ yl@@ ate between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine can be produced .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible in treatment , and in some patients a further deterioration of neuro@@ logical condition can occur .
after an oral individual dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate in gran@@ ular form 15 minutes after taking measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate were determined .
during the period of durability the patient can store the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not exceeding 25 ° C .
with this procedure , the small measuring spoon contains 0.@@ 95 g , the mean measuring spoon 2,@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon 8,6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate .
if a patient has to receive the medicine via a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the solu@@ bility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate amounts to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases certain liver enzymes are missing so that they cannot ex@@ crete the nit@@ ro@@ genous waste products that accum@@ ulate in the body after eating proteins .
if laboratory tests are carried out with you , you need to tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS since sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate may affect the results of certain laboratory tests .
when taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken , even if it is not prescription medicine .
during breast@@ feeding , you should not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS since the medicine could pass into the breast milk and harm your baby .
in rare cases , confusion , headache , taste disturbances , slow@@ ing of the ear , dis@@ orientation , memory problems and the deterioration of existing neuro@@ logical conditions have also been observed .
if you notice one of these symptoms , contact your doctor immediately or with the emergency room of your hospital for initiation of a corresponding treatment .
if you forgot to take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .
changes in the blood pattern ( red blood cells , white blood cells , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes ) , decreased appetite , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , f@@ ain@@ ting , fluid retention ( swelling ) , nausea , con@@ sti@@ pation , unpleasant skin odor , skin rash , kidney dysfunction , weight gain , and abnormal laboratory values .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice any side effects that are not stated in this information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you may no longer use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS according to the exp@@ iry date stated on the box and container after &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; use@@ able until &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exp@@ iry date . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS looks and contents of the package AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets are of whi@@ tish color and oval form , and they are provided with the embos@@ sing &quot; U@@ C@@ Y 500 . &quot;
30 If laboratory tests are carried out with you , you must tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS since sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate may affect the results of certain laboratory tests .
when taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken , even if it is not prescription medicine .
you should take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS distributed to the same individual doses or via a ga@@ stri@@ c fi@@ ber@@ th ( tube which runs directly into the stomach ) or a nas@@ al probe ( hose which is led through the nose into the stomach ) .
31 • Remove from the container an he@@ aped measuring spoon of gran@@ ulate . • P@@ ut a straight edge , e.g. a knife back over the upper edge of the measuring spoon to remove excess gran@@ ulate . • The amount remaining in the measuring spoon equals a measuring spoon . • Take the recommended number of spo@@ ons of gran@@ ules from the container .
An@@ gi@@ ox is used for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( ACS , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example in case of unstable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; stress up@@ lift &quot; ( an anom@@ al@@ ous measured value in the electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) .
if angi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients undergoing a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help in patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
approximately 14 000 patients participated in the primary study of the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of an@@ gi@@ ox was compared with a chemotherapy @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another drug to prevent blood cl@@ ots ) with the conventional combination treatment with he@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a GP@@ I .
during the PCI a st@@ ent ( a short tube that remains in the ar@@ tery to prevent a closure ) was used , and they also received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots such as Ab@@ ci@@ xi@@ mab und A@@ spir@@ in .
in the treatment of ACS , An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without the use of GP@@ I - was as effective in the prevention of new events ( deaths , heart attacks or re@@ as@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or a year overall as effectively as conventional treatment .
in patients who underwent a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was as effective as He@@ par@@ in with respect to all indicators , except for severe bleeding , in which it was much more effective than he@@ par@@ in .
An@@ gi@@ ox may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ dine , other hi@@ ru@@ dine or any of the other components .
it must also not be used in patients who recently had bleeding , as well as people with severe hyper@@ tension or severe kidney problems or a heart infection .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that An@@ gi@@ ox is an acceptable substitute for He@@ par@@ in during the treatment of ACS and during one PCI .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted approval for the marketing application of An@@ gi@@ ox across the European Union to the company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ invasive sur@@ ge inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in case of emergency intervention or early intervention .
the recommended initial dose of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with ACS is an intraven@@ ous mean of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if the patient is already one PCI , an additional bol@@ us of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery can be increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
according to clinical requirements , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be resum@@ ed for 4 to 12 hours after the PCI .
a bol@@ us yield of 0.5 mg / kg is to be administered immediately before the procedure , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation .
the recommended dosage of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with one PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and an immediate subsequent intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
the safety and efficacy of a single bol@@ us administration from An@@ gi@@ ox was not investigated and is not recommended even if a short PCI operation is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to under 225 seconds , a second bol@@ us yield of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should take place .
in order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted medication should be carefully mixed before the application and the stu@@ d@@ dose can be administered intraven@@ ously .
as soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly .
in patients with moderate kidney function restriction ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are under@@ gone one PCI ( whether treated with Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din against ACS or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT @-@ value is less than 225 seconds , a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dose should be checked again .
in patients with moderate kidney damage , included in the II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which led to approval , the ACT score was 5 minutes after administration of the Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din Bol@@ us without dosage adjustment at an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 ) An@@ gi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated in patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and di@@ aly@@ sis patients ( see section 4.3 ) .
treatment with An@@ gi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after the intraven@@ ous administration of un@@ ques@@ tioning he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after finishing the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low molecular he@@ par@@ in .
• known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active substance or any other component or against hi@@ ru@@ dine • active bleeding or increased risk of bleeding caused by a distur@@ b@@ ance of ha@@ em@@ ost@@ asis and / or ir@@ reversible cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially if Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) .
even if the most hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages occur under Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din on arter@@ ial points of punc@@ ture , patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous Cor@@ on@@ ary Intervention ( PCI ) can occur while the treatment in principle occur everywhere bleeding .
in patients who are taking War@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International Reg@@ ulated R@@ atio ) should be considered to ensure that the value after completion of the treatment with Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din is again achieved prior to treatment .
from the knowledge of the mechanism of action of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ par@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , thro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ations ) , it can be assumed that these active substances increase the risk of bleeding .
in the combination of bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ ines with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ations or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ asis parameters are regularly monitored .
the animal experiments are insufficient in relation to the effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , the birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
46@@ 12 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ dine alone , 46@@ 04 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ dine plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and 46@@ 03 were random@@ ized to either un@@ question@@ able he@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
in both the Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ dine group and in the comparison groups treated with He@@ par@@ in it occurred in women as well as in patients over 65 years more common to adverse events than in male or younger patients .
severe hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages were defined in accordance with AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i scales for severe bleeding like in the foot@@ notes of table 2 .
both light and severe bleeding performed significantly less frequently under Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ dine than in groups with ha@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and Bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
an AC@@ U@@ ITY heavy bleeding was defined as one of the following events : in@@ trac@@ ran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular bleeding or hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge in the punc@@ ture area , which required radi@@ ological or surgical intervention , hem@@ at@@ oma with a diameter ≥ 5 cm at the point of punc@@ ture , reduction of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in mirror ≥ 5 g / dl with known bleeding location , re@@ operation due to bleeding , application of blood products for trans@@ fusion .
further , less frequently observed hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages , which occurred at more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) , were &quot; other &quot; punc@@ ture points , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or throat .
the following information about adverse events is based on data from a clinical trial with Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI .
in both the Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ dine group and in the comparison groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , more common adverse events occurred in women and patients over 65 years of age than in male or younger patients .
both light and severe hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages were significantly less common than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
the following side effects , which are not listed above , were reported according to comprehensive application in practice and are group@@ ed into table 6 according to system organ classes .
in case of over@@ dosing , the treatment with Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din is immediately broken off and the patient is closely mes@@ hed to monitor the signs of bleeding .
An@@ gi@@ ox contains Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ dine , a direct and specific th@@ rom@@ binding inhibit@@ or that bin@@ ds both at the cataly@@ tic centre and the an@@ ion @-@ binding region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , regardless of whether Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ ine is present in the liquid phase or cl@@ ots .
the binding of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din to Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and therefore its effect , is reversible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in slowly spl@@ its the bonds of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , which re@@ generates the function of the active center of thro@@ mb@@ in .
in addition , Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din with ser@@ um of patients , where in the past had come to he@@ par@@ in@@ @-@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ hibited th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ hibited th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) , was not induced to indu@@ ce plat@@ el@@ et ag@@ gregation reaction .
in healthy subjects and in patients , Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din shows an anti @-@ dose and concentration @-@ dependent anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect , which is demonstrated by the prolon@@ gation of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT .
if one PCI was subsequently performed in the patients , an additional bol@@ us of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery increased to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h .
in the arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , un@@ ques@@ tioning He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( ACS ) in patients with unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ invasive sur@@ ge inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ized to obtain a GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either before the start of angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ isation ) or with the PCI .
in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients , requiring angi@@ ography within 72 hours , were spread evenly across the 3 arms .
about 77 % of patients had recur@@ rent isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EK@@ G@@ - changes or increased cardiac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and about 99 % of all patients underwent a angi@@ ography within 72 hours .
the primary analysis and results from the AC@@ U@@ ITY study for the 30 day and 1 year end@@ point for the overall population ( IT@@ T ) and for patients who received aspir@@ in and Clo@@ pi@@ do@@ gre@@ l according to protocol ( before angi@@ ography or before PCI ) are presented in tables 7 and 8 .

the 30 @-@ day results , based on quad@@ ru@@ ple and triple end@@ points of a random@@ ised double blind study involving more than 6,000 patients ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , are shown in Table 10 .
clinical studies with a small number of patients provided limited information on the application of angi@@ ot@@ ox@@ in in patients with H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din were evaluated in patients undergoing a perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) as well as in patients with ACS .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used for the treatment of adults , adolescents and children over six years with diabetes that require treatment with insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , the thi@@ ghs or the upper arm inj@@ ected or administered as a permanent in@@ fusion with an insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate the glucose level ( sugar ) in the blood or the insulin can not be processed effectively .
insulin lu@@ li@@ sin differs very slightly from the human insulin , and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter duration than a short @-@ acting human insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in the application in combination with a long @-@ acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study of 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
in type 2 diabetes , in which the body of insulin can not work effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in a study of 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood , which indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
in the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was observed in comparison to a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin colli@@ mat@@ o .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % with human normal insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin swal@@ li@@ sin or any of the other ingredients , or in patients who already suffer from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH a permit for placing A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union .
as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , A@@ pi@@ dra can be applied either in the area of the abdominal wall , the th@@ igh or the delta muscle , or sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous in@@ fusion in the area of the abdominal wall .
due to the reduced glucose @-@ ogen@@ esis capacity and reduced insulin metabolism , the insulin requirement in patients with a restriction of the liver function can be reduced .
any change of the active thickness , the brand ( her@@ - ) , the insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc @-@ delayed etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the method of production can change the insulin requirement .
3 . inadequate dosing or dis@@ continuation of treatment , especially in patients with insulin @-@ based diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and di@@ ab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis . these conditions are potentially life threatening .
the conversion of a patient to another type of insulin or an insulin from another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change of the dosage .
the time of occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia depends on the active profile of the insulin used and can therefore change when changing the treatment scheme .
the substances that increase blood sugar @-@ lowering activity and increase the tendency to hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias include oral anti@@ di@@ abe@@ tics , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , dis@@ cop@@ yr@@ amide , fi@@ br@@ ate , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , mon@@ os@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors , pent@@ oxi@@ f@@ y@@ ll@@ in , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , s@@ ali@@ z@@ yl@@ ates and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics .
in addition , under the effect of sy@@ mp@@ a@@ thetic medications such as beta block@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ id@@ ine , Gu@@ an@@ e@@ thi@@ din and reserves may be atten@@ u@@ ated or absent from the symptoms of adren@@ ergi@@ c counter regulation .
animal experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity did not show any differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ lu@@ li@@ sin and human insulin related to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether insulin action occurs in human breast milk , but insulin is generally not absorbed into the mother &apos;s milk , nor is it res@@ or@@ bed after oral use .
listed below are the un@@ desirable pharmaceutical treatment known from clinical studies , group@@ ed according to system organ classes and sorted by decreasing frequency of their occurrence ( very common : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 ; not known ( frequency based on the data available ) .

if Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy is missed to continuously change the injection point within the injection area , a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy may occur at the injection point .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias with un@@ consciousness can be treated by a in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , given by a correspon@@ dingly trained person , or by intraven@@ ous administration of glucose by a doctor .
after a glucose injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and avoid similar episodes .
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose ( especially through skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) as well as the in@@ hibition of glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that the action occurs more quickly with sub@@ cut@@ aneous GA@@ - be of insulin lu@@ li@@ sin and the active duration is shorter than with cou@@ gh@@ ing normal insulin .
in a study involving 18 male individuals aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes m@@ li@@ - tus , insulin lu@@ li@@ sin showed a glu@@ cos@@ al effect proportional to the dose , and 0.3 E / kg or more a dispro@@ portion@@ ate rise in the glu@@ cos@@ al effect , just like the human insulin .
insulin lu@@ li@@ sin has twice as rapid impact as normal human insulin and achieves the complete glu@@ cos@@ al effect about 2 hours earlier than the human insulin .
it was clear from the data that a comparable post @-@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ ale gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic control was achieved 2 minutes before the meal , as with a human normal insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
if insulin absorption was taken 2 minutes before the meal , a better post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ ale control was achieved than with human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal .
if insulin absorption is directed 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a similar gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved , such as with a human normal insulin , which is given 2 r@@ ents before the meal ( see Figure 1 ) .
insulin lu@@ li@@ sin at gift 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before beginning of the meal compared to human normal insulin , which was given 30 minutes ( N@@ OR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min ) before the start of the meal ( Figure 1A ) as well as compared to human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( N@@ OR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Figure 1@@ B ) .
insulin swal@@ lowed by application 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after the beginning of the meal compared to human normal @-@ mal@@ insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( N@@ OR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the start of the meal ( Figure 1@@ C ) .
