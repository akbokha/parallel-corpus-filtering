<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has evaluated the trials carried out in order to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need more information about your illness or treatment, please read the package description (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you would like more information regarding the CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, as 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of fusion tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as a solution for taking (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. While thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), distrust and delusions; • Bipolar-I disorder, a mental disorder, in which patients have manic episodes (periods of abnormal high-altitude) alternately with periods of normal sentiment.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat medium to severe manic episodes and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have referred to the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for quick monitoring of increased restlessness or behavioural disorders, if the oral intake of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both diseases, the solution to take-in or the fusion tablets can be applied in patients who are experiencing difficulty swallowing.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who are taking other medicines at the same time as Abilify, the dose of Abilify should be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="10">This interferes with the transmission of signals between brain cells by neurotransmitters, i.e. chemical substances which facilitate the communication between nerve cells.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazole is believed to be a "partial agonist" for receptors for neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazol is like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but to a lesser extent as the neurotransmitter works to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin contribute to schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazol contributes to normalize the activity of the brain, which reduces psychotic or manic symptoms and prevents their reoccurrence.</seg>
<seg id="14">The efficacy of abilify to prevent recurrence of symptoms has been studied in three studies lasting up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar disorders that suffered from increased restlessness, over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify was compared to 347 patients with haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent recurrence, compared to 160 patients where the manic symptoms had already been stabilized with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study of 301 patients suffering from increased restlessness compared to Lorazepam (another antipsychotic) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">All studies examined the change in patients' symptoms by means of a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients responding to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also carried out studies to investigate how the body absorbs the melt tablets and the solution to absorb (assimilates).</seg>
<seg id="20">In both studies with the injection solution, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg were significantly stronger than the patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">When applying for the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify reduced manic symptoms more effectively than placebo in four of the five short-term studies.</seg>
<seg id="22">Apart from placebo, Abilify prevented the recurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients for up to 74 weeks and was administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses also reduced more effective than placebo the symptoms of increased restlessness and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disorders (uncontrolled access), Tremor (drowsiness), dieting (drowsiness), digestpation (drowsiness), nausea, vomiting (increased salivation), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the advantages of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and from moderate to severe manic episodes in patients with predominantly manic episodes, and in which the manic episodes discussed the treatment with Aripiprazole, were predominated against the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">Moreover, the committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of injection solution in rapid control of increased restlessness and behavioural disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes associated with bipolar-I disorder, if oral therapy is not suitable, outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission granted the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. to establish Abilify in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar I- disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who mostly had manic episodes and whose manic episodes were related to the treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day, independent of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">Increased efficacy in dosages above a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven, although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once a day, regardless of the meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar I- disorder in patients ≥ 65 years was not proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">Taking into account the greater sensitivity of this group of patients, a lower initial dose should be taken into consideration when clinical factors justify this (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 Inductor is removed from the combination therapy, the dosage should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after beginning or after change of an anti-psychotic therapy, also in treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder there was no increased suicidal risk with Aripiprazol compared to other anti-psychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazole should be used with care in patients with known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, hypertension), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that are predisposing for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including celeriac and maligne form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Late dyskinesia: in clinical studies lasting one year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia occurring during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="39">If patients treated with Abilify show signs and symptoms of late dyskinesia, consider reducing the dose or breaking treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient has developed signs and symptoms that indicate a MNS or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of MNS, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be dismissed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or at states associated with seizures.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazole in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients with Aripiprazole had an increased risk of death compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, there was in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between dosage and response to undesirable cerebrovascular events in patients treated with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical anti-psychotic drugs, including Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk assessments for hyperglycemia-related adverse events associated with Abilify and other atypical anti-psychotic drugs that allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsy, polyurie, polyphagy and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly in relation to worsening glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenia patients and in patients with bipolar disorder due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, where weight gain is known as a side effect or unhealthy lifestyles and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Aripiprazole on the central nervous system, caution is required when Aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines with seizure side effects such as sedation (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist Famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the absorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidin) increased the AUC of Aripiprazol by 107%, while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="52">In CYP2D6 'bad' (= 'poor ") Metabolizers, the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazol compared to CYP2D6 Extensive Metabolizers.</seg>
<seg id="53">Considering the joint application of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 Inhibitors with Abilify, potential benefits should weigh the potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV proteaseinase inhibitors, are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be undertaken.</seg>
<seg id="55">After settling the CYP2D6- or 3A4 Inhibitor, the dosage of Abilify should be raised to the dose level prior to the beginning of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 together with Abilify can be administered with a moderate increase in the concentrations of Aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical trials, doses of 10-30 mg Aripiprazole showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the mediums of CYP2D6 (Dextrometmorphine / 3-methoxymorphine Ratio), 2C19 (Warfarin), 2C19 (Omeprazol) and 3A4 (Dextrometh).</seg>
<seg id="58">The patients should be advised to inform their doctor if they are pregnant or plan pregnancy during the treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">This drug may not be used during pregnancy as a result of insufficient data security for humans and due to the concerns created in animal reproduction studies, unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as with other anti-psychotics, patients should be warned that dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, should be operated until they are certain that Aripiprazol has no negative influence on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following adverse events occurred more frequently (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of adverse events listed below is defined according to the following criteria: frequently (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study of 52 weeks patients treated with Aripiprazole showed a total lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS including Parkinsonism, Akathisie, Dystonia and dyskinesia, compared to patients treated with Haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 19% in patients suffering from Aripiprazol and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study for 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 14.8% in patients treated with Aripiprazole, and 15.1% in patients under Olanzapin therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">In a controlled study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 23,5% in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 53.3% in patients under semi-operidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study for 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 26.6% in patients suffering from Aripiprazole treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term maintenance phase for over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS was 18.2% for patients suffering from Aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and Placebo, where potential clinically significant changes in the routinely controlled laboratory parameters occurred, did not reveal any medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Enhancements of CPK (creatine phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed at 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazol, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">The side effects reported in connection with an antipsychotic therapy are the maligne neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch, unintentional or intentional overdosages with Aripiprazole were observed alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death sequence.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although there is no information about the efficacy of a hematalysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripiprazole, it is unlikely that hematalysis is useful in the treatment of overdose because Aripiprazol has a high plasma protein binding.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of Aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disorder is mediated on the combination of a partial agonistic effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1 receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a-receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripiprazole showed in vitro a high affinity for the dopamine D2- and D3-receptor and the serotonin 5HT1 and 5HT2a receptor as well as a moderate affinity for dopamine D4-, for serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, to alpha-1-adrenergic and to the histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">The positron emission tomography showed a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, at the nucleus caudatus and at the coup.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) in 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazole showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a half-operation-controlled study, 52 percent of respondents, who were referring to the study medication, were similar in both groups (Aripiprazol 77% and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from measurals defined as secondary study objectives, including PANSS and Montgomery-Asberg- depression rate scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement than at Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study for 26 weeks of stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazol showed a significantly higher reduction in the return rate, which was 34% in the Aripiprazol group and 57% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Olanzapin-controlled, multinational double blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, which included 314 patients and in which the primary study target 'weight gain' was, a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg) with an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosage for 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, Aripiprazole showed a efficacy compared to placebo in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study for 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, Aripiprazole showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy studies for 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, Aripiprazol showed a efficacy compared to placebo in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">Also in week 12, Aripiprazl showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania such as lithium or haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study for 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic features, which sometimes did not respond to lithium or valproate monotherapy in therapeutic serum mirrors, escort therapy with Aripiprazole showed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproate.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled study for 26 weeks followed by a long-term extension phase for 74 weeks in manic patients who had achieved remission with Aripiprazole prior to randomisation, Aripiprazole showed himself superior to the prevention of a bipolar relapse, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the dehydration and hydroxytreatment of Aripiprazole, the N-dealkylation is catalyzed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean elimination period is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazol with extensive metabolism via CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in 'poor' (= "poor") metabolics using CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripiprazole there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy volunteers, as well as in a pharmacokinetic examination of schizophrenic patients showed no gender-dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A simulation-specific evaluation of pharmacokinetics did not reveal any clinically significant differences with respect to ethnic origin or the impact of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">Pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole were similar in patients with severe renal insufficiency compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study of subjects with different liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of liver function on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazol, but the study included only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional research on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, reproduction toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential, preclinical data did not identify any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicological significant effects were observed only in dosages or exposure, which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans, so they have limited or no meaning for the clinical application.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included a dose-dependent adrenal toxicity (lipofuscin accumulation and / or parenchymal loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to 3 to 10 times the mean Steady State exposition (AUC) at 60 mg / kg / day (10times the average steady state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose for humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, cholelithiasis was established as a result of the precipitation of sulfate conjugates of the hydroxy- metabolites of Aripiprazole in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the average steady state exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or 16- to 81times the recommended maximum dose for humans based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, the concentrations of the sulfate conjugates of Hydroxy- Aripiprazol found in the human bile at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg were no more than 6% of the concentrations found in the study for over 39 weeks in the gall of monkeys and lie far below the limit values (6%) of the in vitro solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits, these effects were observed after dosages leading to 3 and 11 times the middle steady state AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="145">To increase resorption and minimize variability, an injection into the M. deltoideus or deep into the gluteus maximus muscle is recommended using adipous regions.</seg>
<seg id="146">A lower dose of 5.25 mg (0.7 ml) may be given depending on the individual clinical status taking into account the medicines used for maintenance or acutely therapy (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="147">If a further oral treatment is indicated with Aripiprazol, see the summary of the characteristics of the medicine to Abilify Tablets, Abilify Melting tablets or Abilify solution for taking.</seg>
<seg id="148">There are no tests on the efficacy of Aripiprazol injection solution in patients with detachment and behavioural disorders caused by schizophrenia and manic episodes of bipolar-I disorder.</seg>
<seg id="149">If a parenteral therapy with benzodiazepins is considered necessary in addition to the Aripiprazol injection solution, patients should be observed regarding extreme sedation or blood pressure drop (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="150">Tests on the safety and efficacy of Aripiprazol injection solution are not available for patients suffering from alcohol or drug toxicity (prescribed or illegal drugs).</seg>
<seg id="151">Aripiprazole should be used with care in patients with known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, hypertension), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that are predisposing for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including celeriac and maligne form).</seg>
<seg id="152">Late dyskinesia: in clinical studies lasting one year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia encountered during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="153">Clinical manifestations of a MNS are high fever, stiffness, changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, sweating and arrhythmia).</seg>
<seg id="154">Polydipsy, polyurie, polyphagy and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly in relation to worsening glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="155">Weight gain is generally seen in schizophrenia patients and patients with bipolar disorder due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, where weight gain is known as a side effect or unhealthy lifestyles and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="156">Nevertheless, the intensity of the sedation was greater compared to that of Aripiprazole, in a study where healthy volunteers Aripiprazol (15 mg dose) were intramuscularly administered and who at the same time received Lorazepam (2 mg dose) intramuscularly.</seg>
<seg id="157">105 The h2 antagonist Famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the absorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="158">In CYP2D6 'bad' (= poor ') Metabolitioners the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazol compared to CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="159">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV- proteaseinase inhibitors, are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar doses should be made.</seg>
<seg id="160">After settling the CYP2D6- or 3A4 Inhibitor, the dosage of Abilify should be raised to the dose level prior to the beginning of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="161">When 106 Lorazepam (2 mg dose) received intramuscular, the intensity of the sedation was greater compared to that of Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="162">The following adverse events occurred in clinical trials with Aripiprazol injection solution more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*) (see section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="163">The frequency of adverse events listed below is defined according to the following criteria: frequently (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="164">The following adverse events occurred more frequently (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*) in clinical trials (see section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="165">In a placebo-controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 19% in patients with Aripiprazol- treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="166">In another study for 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 26.6% in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="167">In the long-term maintenance phase for over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS was 18.2% for patients suffering from Aripiprazol and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="168">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and Placebo, where potential clinically significant changes in the routinely controlled laboratory parameters occurred, did not reveal any medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="169">Enhancements of CPK (creatinphosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed at 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazol, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="170">The side effects reported in connection with an antipsychotic therapy are the maligne neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="171">110 and behavioural disorders were the Aripiprazol injection solution with statistically significant larger improvements of agitisation / behavioural disorders associated with placebo and was similar to Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="172">In a placebo-controlled short-term study (24 h) with 291 patients with bipolar disorder as well as agitisation and behavioural disorders, the Aripiprazol injection solution was associated with a statistically significant improvement in symptoms regarding the Agitisation and behavioural disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lorazepam- reference arm.</seg>
<seg id="173">The average improvement of the initial score on the PANSS Excitement Component score for the primary 2-hour endpoint was 5.8 for placebo, 9.6 for Lorazepam and 8.7 for Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="174">In analyses of subgroups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe agitightness, a similar effectiveness was observed in relation to the overall population, but a statistical significance could be determined on account of a decreased patient number.</seg>
<seg id="175">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) in 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazol (oral) showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="176">In a half-operation-controlled study, 52 percent of respondents, who were referring to the study medication, were similar in both groups (Aripiprazol 77% (oral) and haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="177">Current values from measurals defined as secondary study objectives, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg depression rate scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement than at Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="178">In a placebo-controlled study for 26 weeks of stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazol (oral) showed a significantly higher reduction in the return rate of 34% in the Aripiprazol- (oral) group and 57% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an Olanzapin-controlled, multinational double blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, which included 314 patients and in which the primary study target 'weight gain' was, a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg) with an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="180">111 In a placebo-controlled study for 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic features, which in some cases did not respond to lithium or valproate monotherapy in therapeutic serum mirrors, escort therapy with Aripiprazole showed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproate.</seg>
<seg id="181">In a placebo-controlled study for 26 weeks followed by a 74 week study extension in manic patients who achieved remission with Aripiprazole before randomisation, Aripiprazole showed a superior regression regarding the prevention of a bipolar relapse, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="182">In the first 2 hours after intramuscular injection, the Aripiprazole AUC is 90% larger than the AUC after administration of the same dose as a tablet; systemic exposure was similar between the two formulations.</seg>
<seg id="183">In 2 studies with healthy volunteers, the mean time until reaching the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="184">The application of Aripiprazol injection solution was well tolerated by rats and monkeys and did not result in any direct toxicity of a target organ after repeated administration during systemic exposure (AUC) which were intramuscularly 15- or 5 times higher than the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg.</seg>
<seg id="185">In studies on the reproductive toxicity after IV application no safety-related concerns were reported after maternal exposure, which was 15- (rats) and 29-times (rabbits) above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg.</seg>
<seg id="186">Based on conventional studies using Aripiprazole (oral) for safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, reproduction toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential, preclinical data did not identify any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="187">Toxicological significant effects were observed only in dosages or exposure, which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans; thus, they have only limited or no meaning for the clinical application.</seg>
<seg id="188">The effects included a dose-dependent adrenal toxicity (lipofuscin accumulation and / or parenchymal loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (corresponds to 3 to 10 times the mean steady state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose for humans) and an increase of adrenal-steady state exposure (AUC) at 60 mg / kg / day (10 times the mean steady state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose for humans).</seg>
<seg id="189">In addition, a cholelithiasis was established as a result of the precipitation of sulfate conjugates of the hydroxy- metabolites of Aripiprazole in the gall of monkeys after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the mean steady state exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or 16- to 81 times the recommended maximum dose for humans based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="190">In rabbits, these effects were observed after dosages leading to 3 and 11 times of the mean steady state AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="267">The efficacy of Abraxane was examined in a major study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer, of which about three quarters of earlier had received an anthracycline.</seg>
<seg id="268">The effect of Abraxane (in any given gift or monotherapy) was compared with a conventional paclitaxel containing medication (given in combination with other medicines to reduce the side effects).</seg>
<seg id="269">Overall, in the main study 72 (31%) of 229 patients treated with Abraxane were treated to treatment, compared to 37 (16%) of 225 patients using conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="270">Only patients who were treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer were treated with regard to the efficacy indicators such as time to worsening the disease and survival did not make any difference between the drugs.</seg>
<seg id="271">On the other hand, patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="272">It may also not be used in patients who have low neutrophils in the blood prior to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="273">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) found that Abraxane was more effective in patients with which the first treatment was no longer effective than conventional paclitaxel, and that in contrast to other paclitaxel, it must not be given with other medicines to reduce side effects.</seg>
<seg id="274">In January 2008, the European Commission granted the company Abraxane BioScience Limited for the marketing of Abraxane in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="275">Abraxane-Monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients who have failed first-line treatment for metastatic disease and for which a standard anthracycline-containing therapy is not shown (see also section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="276">In patients with severe neutropenia (neutrophils of &lt; 0.50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer) or severe sensory neuropathy, the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series.</seg>
<seg id="277">In sensory neuropathy Grade 3 treatment is to be interrupted until an improvement is reached to degree 1 or 2, and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="278">There are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dosage adjustment in patients with mild to moderate impairment of liver function (see section 4.4. and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="279">There were no trials with patients with impaired kidney function and there is currently no adequate data on the recommendation of dose adaptations in patients with impairment of the renal function (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="280">Abraxane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="281">Abraxane is an albumin-bound nanoparticle formulation of paclitaxel, which may have significantly different pharmacological characteristics than other formulation of paclitaxel (see Section 5.1 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="282">If an allergic reaction occurs, the medicine should be immediately removed and a symptomatic treatment is initiated, and the patient must not be treated with paclitaxel again.</seg>
<seg id="283">In patients no renewed Abraxane treatment cycles should be initiated before the neutrophils number has increased again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the platelet number has risen to &gt; 100 x 109 / l.</seg>
<seg id="284">Patients with severe liver dysfunctions (bilirubin &gt; 5 x ULN or ASL / ALT &gt; 10 x ULN) should not be treated with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="285">While unequivocally treated with Abraxane in connection with cardio toxicity, cardiac occurrences in the indicated patient population are not unusual, especially in patients with earlier anthracycline treatment or underlying heart or lung disease.</seg>
<seg id="286">If nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea occur in patients after the application of Abraxane, it can be treated with the usual anti-emetics and constigating methods.</seg>
<seg id="287">Abraxane should not be used in pregnant women or women in childbearing age, who do not practice effective contraception, except for the treatment of the mother with paclitaxel is essential.</seg>
<seg id="288">Women in childbearing age should apply a reliable contraception method during and up to 1 month after treatment with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="289">Male patients treated with Abraxane will be advised not to give birth during and up to six months after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="290">Male patients should be advised of a sperm conserving prior to the treatment, because the possibility of irreversible infertility is possible through the therapy with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="291">Abraxane can cause side effects such as fatigue (very often) and dizziness (often), which can affect the traffic airtightness and the ability to operate machines.</seg>
<seg id="292">The following are the most common and most important adverse events reported in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer, treated with 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane in pivotal phase III study.</seg>
<seg id="293">Neutropenia was the most conspicuous hematological toxicity (reported in 79% of patients) and was quickly reversible and dose dependent; leukopenia was reported in 71% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="294">Anaemia (Hb &lt; 10 g / dl) was observed in 46% of patients treated with Abraxane and was severe in three cases (Hb &lt; 8 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="295">In Table 1, adverse events in combination with the application of Abraxane as monotherapy have occurred in each dose and indication in studies (N = 789).</seg>
<seg id="296">Very often (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100); rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1000); very rare (&lt; 1 / 10,000).</seg>
<seg id="297">Occasionally: increased blood pressure, weight gain, increased lactate dehydrogenase in the blood, increased creatine in the blood, increased blood sugar, increased phosphorus in the blood, reduced potassium in the blood heart disease:</seg>
<seg id="298">Dyspagie, flatulence, tongue burning, dry mouth, pain of gums, loose stools, osophagitis, pain in the abdomen, sores in the mouth, oral pain, rectal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and urinary tract:</seg>
<seg id="299">Pain in the chest wall, weakness of muscles, neck pain, muscle spasms, muscle spasms, pain in skeletal muscles, side pain, discomfort in the limbs, muscle weakness Very frequent:</seg>
<seg id="300">1. frequency of hypersensitivity reactions calculated based on a definitive case in a population of 789 patients</seg>
<seg id="301">Since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of actual incidence are possible and no causal connection with these events has been established.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an anti-angiotubules substance that promotes the merging of microtubules from the tubulbar and stabilizes microtubules by inhibiting their depolymerisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to an inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganisation of the microtubular network which is essential for the vital interphase and the mitotic membrane functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that albumin mediates the transzysis of plasma components into the endothelial cells and in-vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of albumin promotes the transport of paclitaxel through the endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this improved trance-endothelial transport is mediated by the gp-60 albuminrezeptor and a paclitaxel accumulation in the tumor occurs due to the albuminous protein SPARC (sected protein acidic rich in cysteine).</seg>
<seg id="306">The application of Abraxane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two unarmed unfallied studies and 454 patients treated in a randomised Phase III comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In one study, 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abraxane, which was given in the form of an infusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study, a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an infusion over 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multicentre study was carried out in patients with metastatic breast cancer, which received a monotherapy with paclitaxel every 3 weeks, either in the form of solvent containing paclitaxel, either in the form of solvent containing paclitaxel (N = 225) or in the form of Abraxane 260 mg / m2 as a 30-minute infusion without premedication (N = 229).</seg>
<seg id="310">In the study, 64% of patients had an impaired general condition (ECOG 1 or 2), 79% had visceral metastases and 76% had more than 3 metastases.</seg>
<seg id="311">14% of patients had previously received chemotherapy, 27% had only one adjuvant chemotherapy, 40% only for metastatic disease and 19% for metastatic disease and adjuvant treatment.</seg>
<seg id="312">9 The results for the overall response rate and time until progression-free survival and survival for patients receiving &gt; First-Line therapy are shown below.</seg>
<seg id="313">Neurotoxicity compared to paclitaxel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neuropathy Grade 3 during therapy.</seg>
<seg id="314">The natural course of peripheral neuropathy for the decay of baseline due to the cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and remains unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">Pharmacokinetics of the overall paclitaxel after 30- and 180-minute infusions of Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 were determined in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="316">Exposure to drugs (AUC) increased linearly from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml in analogy to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 According to IV administration of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2, the paclitaxel plasma concentration decreased in a multiphase mode.</seg>
<seg id="318">The medium distribution volume was 632 l / m2. the high distribution volume points to a far-reaching extravascular distribution and / or soft tissue connection of paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study of patients with advanced solid tumours, the pharmacokinetic properties of paclitaxel were compared to intravenous 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 Abraxane with values following a 3-hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">The clearance of paclitaxel was higher (43%) after Abraxane injection, and the distribution volume was higher at Abraxane (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In the published literature on in-vitro studies of human liver microsome and tissue layers it is reported that paclitaxel is metabolized primarily to 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and to two smaller metabolites (3 "-p hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3" -p-Dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer, the mean value for cumulative excretion of the unchanged active substance was 4% of the given total dose with less than 1% of the metabolites 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel, indicating a far-reaching non-renal clearing.</seg>
<seg id="323">However, only a few data are available for patients at the age of over 75 years because only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmacokinetic analysis.</seg>
<seg id="324">The chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and protected against light light over 8 hours.</seg>
<seg id="325">Paclitaxel is a cytotoxic anti-angiogenic drug and, as with other potentially toxic substances, should be treated with caution when handling Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="326">Using a sterile syringe, slowly over a period of at least 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml (0.9%) sodium chloride infusion solution is injected into a Abraxane gas bottle.</seg>
<seg id="327">After complete addition of the solution, the water bottle should rest at least 5 minutes to ensure a good wetting of the solid.</seg>
<seg id="328">Then the water bottle should be swung slowly and carefully for at least 2 minutes and / or ininverted until complete resuspension of the powder is done.</seg>
<seg id="329">If precipitations or sinuses are visible, the water bottle must once again be inverted gently in order to achieve a complete resuspension before the application.</seg>
<seg id="330">The exact total dose of 5 mg / ml slurry needed for the patient is calculated and the corresponding amount of the reformed Abraxane is injected into an empty, sterile PVC- or non-PVC infusion bag.</seg>

<seg id="357">Member states must ensure that the holder of the authorization for placing on the market provides medical professionals in dialysis centers and retailers with the following information and materials:</seg>
<seg id="358">• Training brochure • Summary of the characteristics of the medicine (technical information), labelling and packaging. • With clear imaging of the correct application of the product, boxes for transport are provided by the patient.</seg>
<seg id="359">This means that Abseamed is similar to a biological medicine that has already been approved in the European Union (EU) and contains the same substance (also called "reference medicines").</seg>
<seg id="360">It is used in patients with normal blood glucose concentrations in the case of blood transfusion complications, in case a blood donor is not possible before the procedure and a blood loss of 900 to 1,800 ml can be expected.</seg>
<seg id="361">The treatment with Abseamed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make self-bleeding, Abseamed is injected into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="363">The injection can also be carried out by the patient or his supervisor if they have received appropriate guidance.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency or in patients receiving chemotherapy, the haemoglobin values should always be at the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per deciliter in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron values of all patients must be checked before treatment to ensure there is no iron deficiency and iron supplements should be administered during the entire treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients receiving chemotherapy, or in patients with kidney problems, anaemia may be caused by erythropoietinsufficiency or that the body does not adequately respond to the body's erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of blood loss.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced, enabling them to form epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">Abseamed was compared as an injection into a vein as part of a major study involving 479 patients suffering from kidney problems caused anemia, compared to reference medicines.</seg>
<seg id="370">All patients participating in this study had been injected at least eight weeks of Eprex / Erypo into a vein before they were either converted to Abseamed or continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main indicator of efficacy was the change in haemoglobin values between the beginning of the study and the evaluation period between weeks 25 and 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of Abseamed, injected under the skin, were studied with those of Eprex / Erypo with 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study with patients suffering from kidney problems, the hemoglobin values of patients who were converted to Abseamed were maintained in the same degree as those who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">Compared to this, the patients who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo showed an increase of 0.063 g / dl of the initial value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common side effect of Abseamed is a rise in blood pressure, which can occasionally cause symptoms of encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, smelling migraine headaches and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">Abseamed must not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to epoetin alfa or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="377">Seamed as injections under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems since further studies are required to ensure that it does not trigger allergic reactions.</seg>
<seg id="378">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that for Abseamed according to the regulations of the European Union, evidence has been provided that the medicine has a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile as Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="379">The company that produces Abseamed is provided information packages for medical professionals in all Member States including information on the safety of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="380">In August 2007, the European Commission granted a permit for the marketing of Abseamed across the European Union to the company Medic Medicines Pütter GmbH & Co. kg.</seg>
<seg id="381">Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion demand in adults with solid tumours, malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma who receive chemotherapy and in which there is a risk of transfusion due to the general condition (e.g. cardiovascular status, pre-existing anaemia at the start of chemotherapy).</seg>
<seg id="382">Treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate anaemia (haemoglobin [Hb] 10 - 13 g / dl [6.2 - 8.1 mmol / l], if bleeding-saving measures are not available or inadequate, with planned larger operative interventions, which require a large volume of blood (4 or more units blood for women; 5 or more units blood in men).</seg>
<seg id="383">To reduce foreign blood, Abseamed can be used before a large elective orthopaedic procedure in adults without a lack of iron in which a high risk of transfusion complications is expected.</seg>
<seg id="384">HB 10-13 g / dl) and an expected blood loss of 900-1800 ml which cannot participate in an autologous blood donation program.</seg>
<seg id="385">Hemoglobin concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l) except for pediatric patients where the haemoglobin concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="386">Symptoms of anemia and symptoms may vary depending on age, gender and total disease; therefore, an assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of illness is required by the physician.</seg>
<seg id="387">An increase in hemoglobin by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients, individual hemoglobin values can occasionally be observed in a patient via or below the hemoglobin target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="389">In view of this hemoglobin variability, a corresponding dose management should be used to reach the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) up to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the haemoglobin value increases by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or if the durable hemoglobin value exceeds 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epoetin alfa dosage is reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is used in the lowest permitted dose, which is required to control anaemia and anaemia symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="392">The clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low Hb value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.75 mmol / l) might need higher maintenance doses than patients where initial anaemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">The clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low Hb value (&lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.25 mmol / l) might need higher maintenance doses than patients where initial anaemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.25 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="394">Starting dosage 50 I.U. / kg three times a week using intravenous application, if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.U. / kg (three times a week) until the desired target value is reached (this should take place in steps of at least 4 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="395">Symptoms of anaemia and symptoms may vary depending on age, gender and total disease; therefore, the medical examination of the individual clinical course and condition of illness is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="396">In view of this hemoglobin variability, a corresponding dose management should be used to reach the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) up to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="397">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is used at the lowest permitted dose, which is required for controlling the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="398">If the hemoglobin value is increased by at least 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) or the number of reticulosis by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, the dose of 150 I.U. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.E. / kg once a week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the hemoglobin increase &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) and the number of recirculations of &lt; 40,000 cells / µl has increased compared to the initial value, the dose should be increased to 300 I.U. / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="400">If after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.E. / kg the haemoglobin value increased by ≥ 1 g / dl (≥ 0,62 mmol / l) or the number of recirculations ≥ 40,000 cells / µl, the dose of 300 I.U. / kg should be maintained three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="401">If the hemoglobin value is increased by &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) or the number of recirculations by &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, a response to epoetin-alfa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be aborted.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with mild anaemia (haematocrit 33 - 39%), with which the precautionary storage of ≥ 4 blood vessels is required, should receive Abseamed twice a week for 3 weeks before surgery.</seg>
<seg id="403">Iron substitution should start as early as possible - for example a few weeks before the start of the autologous blood donation program, so that large iron reserves are available before the Abseamed therapy.</seg>
<seg id="404">6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.E. / kg epoetin alfa, which should be given once a week for three weeks (day 21, 14 and 7) before surgery and on the day of surgery (Day 0).</seg>
<seg id="405">On this occasion epoetin alfa should be given preoperatively 300 I.E. / kg every 10 consecutive days, on the day of surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="406">Alternatively, the injection can be given at the end of dialysis via the tube of a fistula needle followed by 10 ml isotonic saline solution to flush the hose and ensure an adequate injection of the medicine in the circulation.</seg>
<seg id="407">Patients undergoing treatment with any erythropoetin at erythroblastomenia (Pure Red Cell Aplasia, PRCA) should not receive a seamed or other erythropoetin (see section 4.4 - erythroblastomenia).</seg>
<seg id="408">Heart attack or stroke in a month before the treatment, unstable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep vein thrombosis (e.g. anamnestically known venous thromboembolia).</seg>
<seg id="409">In patients who are provided for a larger elective orthopaedic procedure and who are unable to participate in an autologous blood donation program, the application of epoetin alfa is contraindicated in the following pre-, accompanying or underlying diseases: severe coronary heart disease, peripheral arterial disease, vascular disease of the carotid or cerebrovascular disease; in patients with recently occurred heart attack or cerebrovascular event.</seg>
<seg id="410">Erythroblastomenia (PRCA) Very rare was reported on the occurrence of an antibody-mediated PRCA after months to months of treatment with subcutaneous erythropoetin.</seg>
<seg id="411">In patients with sudden loss of action, defined as a reduction of haemoglobin values (1 - 2 g / dl per month) with increased need for transfusions, the reticuloyte value should be determined and the usual causes of a non-contact (iron, follic acid or vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminium poisoning, infections or inflammation, blood loss and hemolysis) are examined.</seg>
<seg id="412">If the reticuloyte value, taking into account anaemia (i.e. the reticuloyte index), is lower (&lt; 20,000 / mm3 or &lt; 0.5%), the thrombocyte and leukocyte numbers are normal, and if no other cause of a real loss is found, the anti-erythropoetin antibodies are determined and an investigation of the bone marrow can be considered for diagnosing a PRCA.</seg>
<seg id="413">Data on immunogenicity in subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patients with a risk of an antibody-induced PRCA (patients with renal anemia) are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="414">8 In patients with chronic renal insufficiency, the upper limit of hemoglobin target concentration recommended under section 4.2 should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="415">In clinical studies, increased mortality risk and risk for serious cardiovascular events were observed when erythropoesis-stimulating agents (ESA) were given with a hemoglobin target concentration of over 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="416">Controlled clinical studies have showed no significant benefit attributable to the administration of epoetins when the haemoglobin concentration is increased by the concentration required to control the symptoms of anemia and the prevention of blood transfusions.</seg>
<seg id="417">The hemoglobin increase should be approximately 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month in order to minimize the risk of an increase in hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency and clinically evident coronary artery disease or congestive heart failure, the upper limit of hemoglobin target concentration recommended under section 4.2 should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="419">According to the present findings, the treatment of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adults with renal insufficiency, which is not yet liable to dialysis, does not accelerate the progression of renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="420">Tumour patients with chemotherapy should take into account a 2 - 3-week delay between epoetin-alfa donation and erythropoetin response (patients who may need to be transacted) for the evaluation of the therapy effectiveness of epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="421">If the Hb increase is greater than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or a Hb value of 13 g / dl (8.1 mmol / l), the dose must be adjusted in accordance with paragraph 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible thrombotic events (see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy-related anaemia - dosage adjustment with the aim of keeping the hemoglobin value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision to use recombinant erythropoetine should be based on the benefit-risk assessment with the involvement of the respective patient, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">In patients who are foreseen for greater elective orthopaedic procedure, if possible, the cause of anaemia is examined and treated accordingly before the start of epoetin-alfa therapy.</seg>
<seg id="424">Patients undergoing a major orthopaedic procedure should receive appropriate thrombosis prophylaxis, as they have an increased risk of thrombotic and vascular diseases, especially in the underlying cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="425">In addition, it cannot be ruled out that in treatment with epoetin alfa for patients with an initial shoglobin value of &gt; 13 g / dl an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic / vascular events can exist.</seg>
<seg id="426">In several controlled studies, epoetine was not proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with symptomatic anaemia or decrease risk of tumour progression.</seg>
<seg id="427">4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy was returned when a hemoglobin target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl (7.5 - 8.7 mmol / l) was striven.</seg>
<seg id="428">If epoetin alfa is used together with Ciclosporin, the blood levels of Ciclosporin should be controlled and the Ciclosporine dose should be adjusted to the rising haematocrit.</seg>
<seg id="429">In vitro studies on tumor tissues there are no indications of an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF regarding hematological differentiation or proliferation.</seg>
<seg id="430">About thrombotic, vascular events such as myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular events (cerebral haemorrhage, cerebral infarction), ischial thrombosis, arterial thromboses, arterial thromboses, aneurythromboses, and 11 blood clots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients under erythropoetin treatment, as well as patients under epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="431">The most common side effect during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or the deterioration of an existing hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="432">Increased incidence of thrombovascularization (see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General) was observed in patients under the treatment with erythropoetins.</seg>
<seg id="433">Regardless of erythropoetin treatment, patients with cardiovascular disease can result in thrombotic and vascular complications after repeated blood donations.</seg>
<seg id="434">The genetically determined epoetin alfa is glycosilized and is identical with the amino acids and carbohydrate portion with the endogenous human erythropoetin which was isolated from the urine of indigenous patients.</seg>
<seg id="435">It could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone marrow cells that epoetin alfa specifically stimulates the erythropoesis and does not affect leukopovese.</seg>

<seg id="438">Survival and tumour progression were studied in five large controlled studies with a total of 2833 patients; four of these studies were double-blind placebo-controlled studies and</seg>
<seg id="439">In the open study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with recombinant human erythropoetin patients and control patients.</seg>
<seg id="440">In these studies, patients treated with recombinant humanoid erythropoetin showed a more consistent, statistically significant higher mortality rate than in controls.</seg>
<seg id="441">Overall survival in studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thromboses and related complications in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoetin and in controls.</seg>
<seg id="442">There is an increased risk of thromboembolic events in tumour patients treated with recombinant human erythropoetin, and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="443">It is not clear how far these results relate to the use of recombinant human erythropoetin in tumour patients who are treated with chemotherapy with the aim of achieving a hemoglobin value below 13 g / dl, as too few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data.</seg>
<seg id="444">Epoetin-alfa conditions after repeated IV application showed a half-life of approximately 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a somewhat prolonged half-life of approximately 5 hours in patients with renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="445">After subcutaneous injection, the serum levels of epoetin alfa are much lower than the serum mirrors that are achieved after intravenous injection.</seg>
<seg id="446">There is no accumulation: the serum levels remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift.</seg>
<seg id="447">Bone marrow fibrosis is a known complication of chronic renal insufficiency in humans and could be attributed to secondary hyperparathyreoidism or unknown factors.</seg>
<seg id="448">In a study of hematalysis patients treated with epoetin alfa for three years, the incidence of bone marrow fibrosis was not increased compared to the control group with dialysis patients who were not treated with epoetin alfa.</seg>

<seg id="573">In the first study, nearly 8,000 elderly women with osteoporosis were involved, and the number of spine and hip fractures has been studied for a period of three years.</seg>
<seg id="574">The second study included 2 127 men and women with osteoporosis over 50 years who recently had a hip fracture; the number of fractures over a period of up to five years was studied.</seg>
<seg id="575">In the case of Morbus Paget, Aclasta was tested in two studies on a total of 357 patients and compared with risedronate (another bisphosphonate) for six months.</seg>
<seg id="576">The main indicator of the efficacy was whether the content of alkaline phosphatase in the serum (an enzyme that breaks down bone substance) normalized in the blood or decreased at least 75% compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="577">In the study with older women the risk of vertebral fractures was reduced by 70% over a period of three years in patients with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="578">The risk of hip fractures was reduced by 41% compared to all patients with Aclasta (with or without any other osteoporosis treatment).</seg>
<seg id="579">In the study with men and women with hip fracture, 9% of patients with hip fracture had a fracture (92 of 1 065) compared to 13% of patients under placebo (139 of 1 062).</seg>
<seg id="580">Most side effects of Aclasta occur within the first three days after the infusion and are less frequent in repeated infusions.</seg>
<seg id="581">Aclasta must not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to zoledron acid or other bisphosphonate or any other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="582">As with all bisphosphonates, patients with acetabetic are subject to the risk of kidney complaints, infusion and osteoarthritis (death of bone tissue) in the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="583">The Aclasta manufacturer provides clarification material for physicians that prescribe acetoblaa for osteoporosis treatment, as well as similar material for patients in which the side effects of the drug are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor.</seg>

<seg id="587">The Patient Information Package is intended to provide and include the following core messages: • Contradication in pregnancy and lactating women • Reasement of adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D, adequate physical activity, non smoking and a healthy diet • Significant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When to resort to medical or nursing assistance</seg>
<seg id="588">Treatment of osteoporosis • in postmenopausal women • in men with increased risk of fractures, including patients with a recent low-traumatic hip fracture.</seg>
<seg id="589">For postmenopausal osteoporosis and osteoporosis in men, intravenous 5 mg Accouna is recommended once a year.</seg>
<seg id="590">Patients with a low-traumatic hip fracture are recommended to administer the infusion of acetone two or more weeks after surgical care of the hip fracture (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="591">For the treatment of the Paget Morbus, Aclasta should be prescribed only by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Morbus Paget.</seg>
<seg id="592">After the treatment of the Paget Morbus with Accouna, a long remission was observed in patients who responded to the therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="593">In addition, it is highly advisable to ensure sufficient calcium intake in patients with Morbus Paget, corresponding twice daily at least 500 mg of elemental calcium, for at least 10 days after the administration of acetoblaa (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="594">In patients with a low-traumatic hip fracture, an initial dose of 50,000 to 125,000 I.U. of oral or intramuscular vitamin D is recommended before the first Aclasta infusion.</seg>
<seg id="595">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of acetamol can be reduced shortly after the application of acetamol or ibuprofen after the application of acetamol.</seg>
<seg id="596">Patients with kidney dysfunctions (see section 4.4) In the case of patients with creatinin-Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min, acrelia is not recommended as limited clinical experience for this group of patients is available.</seg>
<seg id="597">Older patients (≥ 65 years) A dosage adjustment is not necessary as bioavailability, distribution and elimination are similar in older patients than in younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="598">Children and adolescents in Accouna are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age because data is missing for safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="599">Acetinin-Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min) is not recommended in patients with severe renal insufficiency (creatinin Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min) because only limited clinical experience exists for this patient population.</seg>
<seg id="600">Pre-existing hypokalemia is to be treated with acetylene by adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D before the treatment begins (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="601">Due to the rapid implementation of the effect of Zoledronlic acid on the bone structure, a temporary, sometimes symptomatic hypokalemia can develop, whose maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days after the infusion of acetoblaa (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="602">In addition, it is highly advisable in patients with Morbus Paget sufficient intake of calcium, corresponding twice daily at least 500 mg of elemental calcium for at least 10 days after the administration of acetoblaa (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="603">Cancer, chemotherapy, treatment with corticosteroids, poor oral hygiene) should be considered before an application of bisphosphonates a dental check with appropriate preventive dental treatment.</seg>
<seg id="604">For patients who need dental surgery, no data is available whether the interruption of treatment with bisphosphonates reduces the risk of osteoporosis in the jaws.</seg>
<seg id="605">Clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit-risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="606">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days of the administration of acetamol can be reduced shortly after the application of acetamol or ibuprofen after the application of acetamol (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="607">The incidence of suspected cases of atrial fibrillation was increased (1.3%) (51 of 3,862) compared to patients receiving placebo (0.6%) (22 of 3,852).</seg>
<seg id="608">In the osteoporosis studies (PFT, HORIZON - Recurrent Fracture Trial [RFT]), the overall frequency of atrial fibrillation between Accouna (2.6%) and placebo (2.1%) was comparable.</seg>
<seg id="609">Very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasional (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000) adverse drug effects are listed in Table 1.</seg>
<seg id="610">Kidney function disorder Zoledronlic acid was associated with kidney function disorders, which were used as a decrease of the kidney function (i.e., an increase in serum creatine) and in rare cases as acute renal failure.</seg>
<seg id="611">The change in creatinin clearances (measured annually before administration) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as a limited kidney function were similar in a clinical study of osteoporosis over three years between the Aclasta- and Placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="612">A temporary increase in serum creatine within 10 days after administration was observed with 1.8% of the patients treated with Aclasta compared to 0.8% of the patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="613">Based on the assessment of the laboratory findings, the temporary asymptomatic calcium values, below the normal fluctuation range (less than 2.10 mmol / l), showed 2.3% of patients treated with Aclasta in a large clinical trial compared to 21% of patients treated with Aclasta in the Paget-Paget trials.</seg>
<seg id="614">All patients received adequate amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study of postmenopausal osteoporosis in the study on preventing clinical fractures after a hip fracture and in the Morbus Paget trials (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="615">In the study on preventing clinical fractures after a recent hip fracture, vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="616">Local reactions after the administration of zoledron acid in a large clinical study was reported on local reactions at the infusion site such as redness, swelling and / or pain (0.7%).</seg>
<seg id="617">Osteonecroses in the jaw area have been reported, especially in cancer patients, about osteonecroses (primary in the jaw zone), which were treated with bisphosphonates, including coledron acid.</seg>
<seg id="618">Many of these patients had signs of local infections including osteomyelitis, and most of the reports relate to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental intervention.</seg>
<seg id="619">7 study involving 7,736 patients showed signs of osteoarthritis in the orthodontic area in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="620">In the event of an overdose that leads to clinically relevant hypokalemia, calcium gluconate can be balanced by giving oral calcium and / or intravenous calcium gluconate.</seg>
<seg id="621">Clinical efficacy in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PFT) The efficacy and safety of acetoblaa 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was indicated in postmenopausal women (7,736 women at the age of 65 and 89 years) with either a bone density (BMD) T-score for the Schenkelhal ≤ -1.5 and at least two mild or a moderate-weight existing spinal fracture or a BMD-T-score for the Schenkelhal ≤ -2.5 with or without signs of an existing spinal fracture.</seg>
<seg id="622">Effects on morphometric vertebrate fractures increased significantly over a period of three years and after one year the frequency of one or more new vertebral body fractures (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="623">Patients aged 75 and older had a 60% reduced risk of vertebral fractures compared to placebo patients (p &lt; 0.0001).</seg>
<seg id="624">Effects on hip fractures Aclasta showed a constant effect over three years, resulting in a 41% (95% CI, 17% to 58%) reduced risk of hip fractures.</seg>
<seg id="625">Effects on bone density (BMD) Aclasta increased bone density on lumbar spine, hip and distal radius compared with placebo treatment significantly at all times (6, 12, 24 and 36 months).</seg>
<seg id="626">9 Increase of bone density of the lumbar spine by 6.7%, the total hip by 6.0%, the femoral neck by 5.1% and the distal radius by 3.2%.</seg>
<seg id="627">Bone histology In 152 postmenopausal osteoporotic patients treated with Accouna (N = 82) or placebo (N = 70), one year after the third annual dose of bone biopsies from the pelvis.</seg>
<seg id="628">A microcomputer tomography (µCT) analysis showed an increase in the trabecular bone volume and the retention of the trabecular bone architecture in patients treated with the placebo.</seg>
<seg id="629">Bone turnover marker The bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), the N-terminale Propeptide of type I- collagen (P1NP) in serum and the beta-C telopeptid (b-CTx) in serum were determined in subgroups of 517 to 1,246 patients in periodic intervals during the duration of study.</seg>
<seg id="630">Treatment with an annual 5 mg dose Aclasta significantly reduced BSAP by 30% compared to the initial value and was kept at 28% below the initial value of up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="631">P1NP was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52% below the initial value of up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="632">B-CTx was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55% below the initial value of up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="633">The vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D (50,000 to 125,000 I.E. orally or intramuscular) 2 weeks before infusion.</seg>
<seg id="634">The total mortality was 10% (101 patients) in the treated group, compared to 13% (141 patients) in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="635">Effects on bone mineral density (BMD) In the HORIZON-RFT study, in comparison to placebo treatment, the BMD increased the BMD at all points of time.</seg>
<seg id="636">Over 24 months, the Aclasta treatment led to an increase in BMD by 5.4% compared to placebo treatment and 4.3% on the femoral neck.</seg>
<seg id="637">Clinical efficacy in men In the HORIZON-RFT study 508 men were randomised and in 185 patients the BMD was evaluated after 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="638">The study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical fractures in men; the frequency of clinical fractures was 7.5% in men treated in men compared to 8.7% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="639">In another study in men (study CZOL446M2308), once an annual dose of alendronate compared to once weekly dose of alendronate was not inferior to the percentage change in the lumbar vertebra BMD after 24 months compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="640">Clinical effectiveness of the treatment with Morbus Paget of the bone Aclasta was studied in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radiologically confirmed, mainly mild to moderately heavy-weight pathogen Paget of the bone (mean serum mirror of alkaline phosphatase according to the 2.6x to 3.0fold age-specific upper normal value when included in the study).</seg>
<seg id="641">11 The efficacy of infusion of 5 mg of Zoledron acid compared to intake of 30 mg of risedronate once a day for 2 months was proven in two six months comparative studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">In the combined results, a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain relief was observed in comparison to the initial value for acetone and risedronate.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients who were classified as Responder at the end of the six-month main study (responded to the therapy) could be included in a follow-up phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">From the 143 with Aclasta and 107 patients treated with Risedronate, the therapeutic response was observed in 141 of patients treated with acetate, compared to 71 patients treated with Risedronate, with an average duration of the follow-up period of 18 months after the application.</seg>
<seg id="645">One-time and multiple 5 and 15 minute infusions of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg of Zoledron acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmacokinetic data which proved to be dosisindependent.</seg>
<seg id="646">Then the plasma level rapidly decreased to &lt; 10% of the peak value after 4 h and &lt; 1% after 24 hours, followed by a long period of very low concentration, no more than 0.1% of the peak value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Rapid biphasic disappearance from the large cycle with half-life times t ½ α 0.24 and t ½ to 1.87 hours followed by a long expulsion phase with a terminal elimination period t ½ g 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early distribution phases (α and β, with the above and ½ -values) represent presumably the rapid absorption in the bones and the excretion via the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 hours 39 ± 16% of the administered dose is found in the urine, while the rest is mainly bonded to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The total body clearance is 5,04 ± 2.5 l / h independent of the dose and remains unaffected by gender, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion period from 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease of the zoledron acid concentration by 30% at the end of the infusion, but had no effect on the surface under the curve (plasma concentration versus time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A decreased Clearance of the metabolized substances by Cytochrom-P450 enzymes is unlikely because zoledronic acid is not metabolized in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or irreversible, metabolism-dependent inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient groups (see section 4.2) The renal clearing of the Zoledron acid correlated with the creatinin Clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of the creatine Clearance, and was 84 ± 29 ml / min in the 64 examined patients (range 22 to 143 mL / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">This results in a slight (ccr = 50 - 80 ml / min) and a moderate kidney function disturbance down to a creatinin Clearance up to 35 ml / min does not require the dosage adjustment of the Zoledron acid.</seg>
<seg id="655">Because there is only limited data for severe kidney dysfunctions (creatinin Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min), no statements are possible for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The maximum administered intravenous dose was 10 mg / kg of body weight in mice and 0.6 mg / kg body weight in rats.</seg>
<seg id="657">In dogs studies, single doses of 1.0 mg / kg (based on the AUC was 6 times the recommended human therapeutic exposure), administered over a period of 15 minutes, good and without a renal influence.</seg>
<seg id="658">Subcutaneous and chronic toxicity In studies with intravenous application, the renal tolerability of Zoledron acid was given in rats by taking doses of 0.6 mg / kg as a 15-minute infusion in 3-day intervals (a cumulative dose that corresponds to the 7x of the human therapeutic exposure related to the AUC), well tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="659">In long-term studies with repeated use in cumulated expositions, which adequately exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure, toxicological effects on other organs, including gastrointestinal tract and liver, and the intravenous injection point.</seg>
<seg id="660">The most frequent infestation in trials with repeated use was an increased primary sponge in the metaphysis of the long bones in the growth phase with virtually all dosages, an infestation, which reflects the pharmacological, antiresorptive effect of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="661">In rats, teratogenicity in dosages of 0.2 mg / kg was observed as outer and inner (visceral) abnormalities and such a skeleton.</seg>
<seg id="662">No teratogenic effects or embryo-fetal effects were observed in rabbits, although the maternal toxicity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg due to the low serum calcium level.</seg>

<seg id="671">Zoledron Acid is a representative of a substance called bisphosphonate and is used to treat osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, osteoporosis in men and the pathogen Paget of the bone.</seg>
<seg id="672">Decreasing blood levels of sex hormones, especially estrogen, which are made from androgens, play a role in the gradual loss of bone mass observed in men.</seg>
<seg id="673">In the Paget morbus, bone reconstruction is too fast, and new bone material is structured unordered, which makes the bone material weaker than normal.</seg>
<seg id="674">Aclasta works by normalising bone reconstruction, thereby ensuring normal bone formation and thus reinforces strength.</seg>
<seg id="675">If you are undergoing dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery, tell your doctor that you will be treated with Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="676">When using Aclasta with other medicines please inform your doctor, pharmacist or nursing staff if you have taken other medicines / use or have recently taken / applied, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="677">It is particularly important for your doctor to know if you are taking drugs that are known to damage the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="678">When using Aclasta together with food and drink, you are concerned that you will receive plenty of liquid before and after treatment with acetone according to your doctor's instructions.</seg>

<seg id="749">Summary of the EPAR for the public: this document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has evaluated the trials carried out in order to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be used alone (monotherapy) in patients (especially overweight patients) where metformin (a diabetes medication) is not indicated. • It can be used together with another diabetes medication (dual therapy).</seg>
<seg id="751">It can also be applied to metformin in patients (especially obese patients) who cannot be satisfactory with metformin alone in the highest tolerated dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulfonyl chloride or insulin, the present dose of the sulfonygum or insulin can be maintained at the beginning of the Actos treatment, except in patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); this should reduce the dose of the sulfa or insulin.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level sinks, allowing type 2 diabetes to be better adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of Actos in tripletherapy was examined; in addition, the patients received a combination of metformin with a sulfonyl resin, in addition they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies, the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylated hemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured, which indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos resulted in lowering the HbA1c value, suggesting that the blood sugar levels were lowered when applying the doses of 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the tripletherapy study, the effect of the additional dose of Actos for existing treatment with metformin and a sulphonyl resin was reduced by 0.94%, while the additional administration of placebo led to a decrease of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study, in which the combination of Actos and insulin was examined in 289 patients, the patients who received Actos in addition to insulin had a decrease in HbA1c levels of 0.69% after 6 months, compared with 0.14% in patients who additionally took placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common side effects associated with Actos were vision disturbances, upper respiratory tract infections, weight gain and hypothesiologist (reduced sensitivity to stimuli).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos may not be used in patients who may be sensitive (allergic) to spoglitazone or any of the other components, nor in patients with liver problems, heart failure, or diabetic ketoacidosis (high levels of ketone levels - acid levels - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that an alternative to standard treatment with metformin should be used as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin in patients where metformin is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission granted the Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited, a permit for the marketing of Actos across the European Union.</seg>

<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus whose blood sugar is insufficient with insulin and where metformin is inappropriate due to contraindications or intolerance (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">No data is available for the use of pioglitazone in patients under 18 years of age, so the application in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">If the presence of at least one risk factor (e.g. previous heart attack or symptomatic coronary artery disease) is at risk of developing a decompensated heart failure, the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or edema, especially those with reduced cardiac reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and oedema when Pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">Cardiovascular Outcome study with pioglitazone in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease was performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">This study showed an increase in heart failure reports, which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output liver enzyme (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range) or with other signs of liver disease, Pioglitazone may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT levels are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range, the Liver Enzymes are to be checked again as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient develops symptoms that point to hepatic dysfunction such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, overriding disorders, fatigue, loss of appetite and / or dark urine, the liver enzyme levels are to be checked.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision to continue the treatment of the patient with a Pioglitazon should be conducted before the clinical evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical studies with Pioglitazone, a dose-dependent weight gain has been proven, which can be caused by fat deposits and in some cases associated with fluid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a consequence of hemodilution, a slight reduction of the mean hemoglobin values (relative reduction by 4%) and hematocrits (relative reduction of 4.1%) occurred under the therapy with Pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in patients under metformin (relative reduction of hemoglobin by 3-4% and hematokrits by 3-4% and hematokrits by 3.1-2% and hematokrits by 1-3.2%) in patients with metformin (relative reduction of hemoglobin by 1-2% and hematokrits by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin sensitivity, there is a risk of dose-dependent hypoglycemia in patients who receive Pioglitazone as oral secondary or triple combination therapy with insulin or as a dual-combination therapy with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the market launch, a reduction of visual acuity was reported in the treatment with thiazole-indiones, including Pioglitazone, a occurrence or deterioration of diabetic macular edema.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct connection between taking Pioglitazone and the occurrence of macular edema, but killing doctors should be aware of the possibility of a macular edema when patients report about disorders of visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmological examination should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of adverse events related to bone fractures from randomised controlled, double-blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazone</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated fracture incidence ranged from 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with Pioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the ProActive study, a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years), compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy and if a patient desires a pregnancy or if this occurs, the treatment is deprecated (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies on the interactions have shown that Pioglitazone does not have any relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics or drug dynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with medicines that are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptives, cyclosporine, calcium channel blocker and HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous use of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a Cytochrom P450 2C8 inhibitor) resulted in a 3-fold increase in the AUC from Pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazone with rifampicin (a Cytochrom P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a 54% decrease in the AUC from Pioglitazon.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the fact that under treatment with Pioglitazone the hyperinsulinaemia resulting in pregnancy decreases and increases the availability of the metabolic substrates for fetal growth.</seg>

<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change of the turgor and refractive index of the lens, as they are observed in other hypoglycemic agents.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical trials with Pioglitazone, ALT ascents across the threefold of the upper limit of the standard range were equally common to placebo, but less frequently than in comparison groups under metformin or sulfonyharnide.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an Outcome study in patients with advanced macrovascular disease, the incidence of severe cardiac insufficiency under pioglitazone was 1.6% higher than placebo, if Pioglitazone or</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch, it has rarely been reported about heart failure under Pioglitazon, but more frequently if Pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summary analysis of adverse events related to bone fractures from randomised controlled, double-blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years involving more than 8,100 patients in patients treated with Pioglitazone and more than 7,400 patients in patients treated with comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="796">Over a period of 3.5 years of the ProActive study, fractures of 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with Pioglitazone treated patients compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients treated with comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">When taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day for four days, then 180 mg / day for seven days, no symptoms occurred.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazon appears to have an activation of specific nuclear receptors (Peroxicome Proliferator activated recurve gamma (PPAR-γ)), leading to increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells in the animal model.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazone reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose level in the case of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with Pioglitazone versus Gliclazide was continued over two years to investigate the time until the therapeutic effect is stopped (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8,0% after the first 6 months of treatment).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time of two years after the start of therapy, blood glucose control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) could be maintained by Pioglitazone in 69% of patients treated (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclazide).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study for 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was inadequate with insulin despite three months of optimization was randomised to pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients with Pioglitazone, the mean HbA1c was reduced by 0.45% compared to the patients receiving only insulin; a reduction of insulin dosage in the group treated with Pioglitazone was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">Clinical trials for one year showed a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / creatinin quotients compared to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazone (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small study of type 2 diabetics in a small study of 18 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical studies, compared to placebo, a reduction of total plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids and an increase in HDL cholesterol levels as well as marginally but clinically not significantly increased LDL cholesterol levels were observed.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, pioglitazone reduced compared to placebo, metformin or Gliclazide, total plasticides and free fatty acids and increased HDL cholesterol.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to placebo, there was no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol levels under Pioglitazone, while in Metformin and Gliclazide, decreased values were observed.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study of more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazone reduced not only the triglyceride level, but also improved the postprancordial triglyceride level, which has an effect on triglyceride absorption and the hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the ProActive study, a cardiovascular outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease were randomised to receive either Pioglitazone or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application, Pioglitazone is absorbed quickly, whereby the peak concentrations of unmodified pioglitazone in the plasma usually reach 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, the contribution of M-IV to effectiveness in roughly three times the effectiveness of Pioglitazone, whereas the relative efficacy of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies, Pioglitazon has no relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous application of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a Cytochrom P450 2C8 inhibitor) or with rifampicin (a Cytochrom P450 2C8 inductor) increases respectively lowers the plasma concentration of Pioglitazone (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After oral use of radioactively marked pioglitazone in humans the marker was found mainly in rotting (55%) and to a lesser extent in the urine (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The average plasma-elimination length of unmodified pioglitazone amounts to 5-6 hours in humans, and the total active metabolites are 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma concentrations of Pioglitazone and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy volunteers, but the rates of the oral clearance of the parent substance are similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies mice, rats, dogs and monkeys appeared in accordance with repeated administration of plasma volume enlargement with hemodilution, anemia and reversible eccentric heart hypertrophy.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the fact that under treatment with Pioglitazone the hyperinsulinaemia resulting in gestation reduces the insulin resistance of the mother animal and thereby diminishes the availability of the metabolic substrates for fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years) increased incidence of hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumors (in male rats) of the urinary bladder was induced.</seg>
<seg id="821">In an animal model of the family adenomatous polyposis (FAP) the treatment with two other thiacolidal-indiones led to an increased frequency of colonic tumours.</seg>

<seg id="824">In the ProActive study, a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years), compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study for more than two years, the effects of a combination therapy of metformin with Pioglitazone or Gliclazide were investigated.</seg>
<seg id="826">Clinical trials for more than one year showed a statistically significant decrease in albumin / creatinine quotients compared to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study of more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazone reduced not only the nicotine triglycerides, but also improved the postprancordial elevated triglyceride level, this has an effect on tryglyceride absorption and the hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study lacked the objective of its primary endpoint, which presented a combination of the total mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, leg amputation above the ankle, coronary revascularisation and revascularisation of the leg arteries, the results suggest that with the intake of Pioglitazone, no cardiovascular long-term risks are associated.</seg>

<seg id="871">Pre-mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice daily, if a rapid initial effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect.</seg>
<seg id="872">The injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose was injected.</seg>
<seg id="873">Patients whose blood sugar adjustment has improved significantly through intensified insulin therapy can change the hypoglycemia alert symptoms and should therefore be advised accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="874">Any change in terms of strength, brand (manufacturer), type of insulin (fast acting, biphasic, long acting insulin, etc.), type of insulin (animal insulin, human insulin or insulin analog) and / or production method (due to recombinant DNA compared to insulin) can cause a change in the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="875">If a dose adjustment is required when changing to Acciphane, it may be necessary for the first dose or in the first weeks or months after conversion.</seg>
<seg id="876">Some patients with hypoglycemic reactions after changing animal to human insulin reported that early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin.</seg>
<seg id="877">Before travelling over several time zones, the patient should be advised to pick up the doctor's advice, as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times.</seg>
<seg id="878">The doctor must therefore take into account possible interactions during therapy and always ask his patients for treatments taken by them.</seg>
<seg id="879">4 Both hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, which can occur in a non-sufficiently controlled diabetes care, increase the risk of deformities and fertility in utero.</seg>
<seg id="880">Severe hypoglycemias can lead to loss of consciousness and / or seizures, and with temporary or permanent disorders of the brain function and even death.</seg>
<seg id="881">Diseases of the nervous system - peripheral neuropathy A rapid improvement in blood sugar control can be associated with discomfort associated with acute painful neuropathy and usually reversible.</seg>
<seg id="882">5. intensification of insulin therapy with an abrupt improvement in the blood sugar level can, however, be associated with a temporary deterioration in diabetic retinopathy.</seg>
<seg id="883">Diseases of the skin and subcutaneous tissue Hide - Lipodystrophy At the injection point, a lipodystrophy may occur if missed to change the penetration place within the injection area.</seg>
<seg id="884">General conditions and complaints at the administration site: local hypersensitivity reactions at the injection point During insulin therapy, local hypersensitivity reactions (redness, swelling, itching, pain and haematoma occur at the injection point) can occur.</seg>
<seg id="885">Diseases of the immune system - Urticaria, exanthem Very rare - anaphylactic reactions symptoms of generalized hypersensitivity, including generalized skin rash, itching, sweating, gastrointestinal disorders, angioneurotic oedema, breathing difficulties, palpitations, low blood pressure and fainting / unconsciousness.</seg>
<seg id="886">Hypoglycaemia may develop gradually: • Light hypoglycemias can be treated by the oral intake of glucose and sugary foods.</seg>
<seg id="887">Diabetics should therefore always have grape sugar, sweets, biscuits or sugar-containing fruit juice. • Heavy hypoglycemias with unconsciousness are treated with an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1.0 mg) by means of an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1.0 mg) or by glucose, which is given intravenously by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="888">The effect starts within half an hour, the maximum of action is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the entire duration of action is up to 24 hours.</seg>
<seg id="889">Resorption The resorption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast and delayed resorption.</seg>
<seg id="890">A number of fission (hydrolysis) places on the human insulin molecule were considered; none of the metabolites formed by the split is active.</seg>
<seg id="891">Based on conventional research on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data do not detect particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="892">It is recommended - after removing the Acciphane water bottle from the refrigerator - to increase the insulin temperature at room temperature (not exceeding 25 ° C) before it is resuspended according to the user manual for the first use.</seg>
<seg id="893">Some patients with hypoglycemic reactions after changing animal to human insulin reported that early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin.</seg>

<seg id="1176">In comparison, this was 22% (60 of 268) of the patients under Allopurinol and in none of the 134 patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1177">The most common side effects of adenuria (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) include headache, diarrhea, nausea (nausea), rash and abnormal liver values.</seg>
<seg id="1178">Especially in patients with heart problems in prehistory there may also be an increased risk of certain side effects affecting the heart and blood vessels.</seg>
<seg id="1179">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) reached the conclusion that Adenuric was more effective in lowering the uric acid level in the blood than Allopurinol, but also a higher risk of side effects associated with the heart and blood vessels.</seg>
<seg id="1180">Treatment of chronic hyperuricaemia in diseases that have already led to urinary deposits (including one out of the medical history known or present at present and / or arthritis).</seg>
<seg id="1181">If the serum acid levels are still &gt; 6 mg / dl (357 µmol / l) after 2-4 weeks, a dose increase on ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x can be taken into consideration daily.</seg>
<seg id="1182">Efficacy and safety have not been fully studied in patients with severe kidney function restriction (creatinin Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min, see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1183">Children and adolescents because there are no experiences in children and adolescents, the use of Febuxostat in this group of patients is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1184">Organ transplant recipients since there are no experiences with organ transplant recipients, the use of Febuxostat in this group of patients is not recommended (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1185">Cardiovascular disease in patients with ischemic heart disease or decompensated heart failure is not recommended treatment with Febuxostat (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1186">As with other resin-based medicines, acute rheumatism can occur during the treatment process, because of the reduction of the serum uresophagus, uric acid deposits can first be mobilised in the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="1187">B. in malignant diseases and their treatment, Lesch- Nyhan syndrome) the absolute concentration of Xanthin in the urine in rare cases increases so far that it comes to a deposit in the urinary tract.</seg>
<seg id="1188">Liver disease During Phase 3 clinical studies, minor abnormalities of liver function values were observed in patients treated with Febuxostat (3.5%).</seg>
<seg id="1189">It is therefore recommended to perform a liver function test before the start of the febuxoast treatment and in the further course depending on clinical findings (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1190">Theophyllin Zwas did not carry out interaction studies on Febuxostat, but it is known that the XO inhibition leads to an increase in theophylline (a hibition of the metabolism of theophylline was also reported for other XO-inhibitors).</seg>
<seg id="1191">In subjects, the simultaneous administration of fiebuxostat and naproxen was 250 mg 2 x a day associated with an increase in fiebuxostats (Cmax 28%, AUC 41% and t1 / 2 26%).</seg>
<seg id="1192">In clinical trials, the application of naproxen or other NSAR / Cox-2 inhibitors was not associated with clinically significant increase of adverse events.</seg>
<seg id="1193">Colchicin / Indometacin / hydrochlorothiazide / Warfarin Febuxostat can be used together with colchicin or indometacin without a dosage adjustment for Febuxostat or the other active ingredient used at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1194">In a study involving subjects, 120 mg of ADENURIC 1 x showed an average 22% increase in the AUC of desipramine, a CYP2D6 substrate, which indicates a possible weak inhibitory effect of Febuxostat on the CYP2D6 enzyme in vivo.</seg>
<seg id="1195">Antazida It could be shown that simultaneous intake of a antacid, magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide, delayed the absorption of Febuxostat (around 1 hour) and a decrease in Cmax by 32%, but no significant change in AUC causes.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Pregnancy data about a very limited number of exposed pregnancies can not be concluded on the side effects of Febuxostat on pregnancy or the health of the fetus / newborns.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Animal experimental studies do not suggest either direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development or birth (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="1198">Patients should be careful when controlling a vehicle, operating machines or when performing hazardous activities until they can be reasonably sure that ADENURIC does not adversely affect their performance.</seg>
<seg id="1199">A numerically higher incidence of the cardiovascular events reported by the investigator was observed in the overall survival study of phase 3 (1.3 versus 0.3 events per 100 patient years) and in long-term extensions (1.4 versus 0.7 events per 100 patient years), although no statistically significant differences were found and no causal connection with Febuxostat could be detected.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The risk factors determined by these patients were an arteriosclerotic disease and / or a myocardial infarction or a decompensated heart failure in the medical history.</seg>
<seg id="1201">Common (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10), occasional (≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100) and rare (≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000) side effects reported in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg Febuxostat and which were reported in all Febuxostat treatment groups more than once are listed below.</seg>
<seg id="1202">Diarrhea, nausea and vomiting are more common in patients treated at the same time with colchicin. * * In the clinical studies no severe skin rashes or severe hypersensitivity reactions were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1203">7 Open long-term extension studies In the open long-term extension studies 906 patients have been treated for up to 1 year, 322 patients up to 2 years, 57 patients up to 3 years long and 53 patients up to 4 years with Febuxostat 80 mg / 120 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1204">The events reported during the long-term extension studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies (see table 1).</seg>
<seg id="1205">The subsequent treatment-related events were reported more than once in all Febuxostat- treatment groups and occurred in patients who received Febuxostat 80 mg / 120 mg in long-term extension studies (up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,900 patient years), according to the data occasionally.</seg>
<seg id="1206">The following treatment-related events were either not reported at all in pivotal studies of phase 3 or with a lower frequency:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Diabetes, hyperlipidemia, insomnia, hypesthesia, conspicuous ECG, cough, short breathe, skin discoloration, skin lesions, bursitis, protein uria, renal insufficiency, erectile dysfunction, increase of potassium concentration in the blood, decrease of lymphocyte number, decrease in the number of white blood cells.</seg>
<seg id="1208">The active mechanism of uric acid is the end product of the purine metabolism in humans and arises as part of the reaction askade hypoxanthin → Xanthin → uric acid.</seg>
<seg id="1209">Febuxostat is a potent, non-purine-selective inhibitor of the XO (NP-SIxO) with a Ki-value for in vitro-inhibiting which lies below the nanomolar range.</seg>
<seg id="1210">Clinical study results The efficacy of ADENURIC was shown in two pivotal studies in phase 3 (APEX study and FACT study as described below), which were performed with 1,832 patients with hyperuricemia and gout.</seg>
<seg id="1211">The primary efficacy endpoint was in each study the proportion of patients where the last three monthly serum acid levels were &lt; 6.0 mg / dl (357 µmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="1212">Placebo (n = 134), ADENURIC 80 mg 1 x daily (n = 267), ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x daily (n = 269), ADENURIC 240 mg 1 x daily (n = 269), ADENURIC 240 mg 1 x daily (n = 269), ADENURIC 240 mg 1 x daily (n = 269), ADENURIC 240 mg 1 x daily (n = 258) for patients with a serum cancer rate at the start of study of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl.</seg>
<seg id="1213">The APEX study showed the statistically significant superiority of the treatment with ADENURIC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x daily as well as with ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with commonly used doses of allopurinol 300 mg (n = 258) / 100 mg (n = 10).</seg>
<seg id="1214">The FACT study showed the statistically significant superiority of the treatment with ADENURIC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x daily as well as with ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x daily compared with the conventional dose of allopurinol 300 mg.</seg>

<seg id="1216">The lowering of the serum acid level to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl (357 µmol / l) was observed during the visit to the doctor in week 2 and sustained throughout the entire treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1217">509 patients received allopasinol 300 mg 1 x daily; 10 patients with serum cancer &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily.</seg>

<seg id="1219">With ADENURIC the primary efficacy endpoint was reached at 44% (80 mg 1 x daily), 45% (120 mg 1 x daily) and 60% (240 mg 1 x daily) of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="1220">There were no clinically significant differences in the percentage return of serum acid concentrations in subjects, irrespective of their renal function (58% in the group with normal kidney function and 55% in the group with severe kidney dysfunctions).</seg>
<seg id="1221">Primary endpoint in the subgroup of patients with serum acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl of Etwa 40% of the patients (APEX- and FACT study) had a serum acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl.</seg>
<seg id="1222">The data from the Phase 3 open extension study collected in two years showed that reduction of the serum acid levels increased to &lt; 6 mg / dl (&lt; 357 µmol / l), so that less than 3% of patients in the months 16-24 needed treatment against a gout (i.e. more than 97% of patients did not require treatment against a cast).</seg>
<seg id="1223">This was associated with a reduction in the size of the gout, which resulted in a total disappearance of the gout nodes up to 24% in 54% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="1224">Increased TSH- values (&gt; 5.5 microIE / ml) were observed in patients who received long-term treatment with Febuxostat (5.0%) and also in patients receiving allopurinol (5.8%) in open long-term extension studies (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1225">In healthy subjects, the maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) and the area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) of Febuxostat increased after administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dose.</seg>
<seg id="1226">For doses between 120 mg and 300 mg, an increase in AUC is observed for Febuxostat, which is greater than the dose-proportional increase.</seg>
<seg id="1227">After taking single or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily, the Cmax amounts to approximately 2.8-3.2 µg / ml and 5.0-5.3 µg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1228">However, no clinically significant change was observed in the percentage decrease of serum acid concentration, provided that this was tested (multiple doses of 80 mg).</seg>
<seg id="1229">Distribution The apparent steady state distribution volume (Vss / F) of Febuxostat ranges from 29 to 75 l after intake of doses of 10-300 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1230">The plasma protein binding of Febuxostat is approximately 99.2% (primary bond to albumin) and is constant over the concentration width that is reached with doses of 80 and 120 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1231">In vitro studies in human liver microsomes, these oxidative metabolites are formed mainly by CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2C8 or CYP2C9, and that Febuxostatglucuronide is mainly produced by UGT 1A1, 1A8, and 1A9.</seg>
<seg id="1232">After taking an 80 mg dose of 14C-marked Febuxostat, about 49% of the dose was found in the urine as an unchanged Febuxostat (3%), its known oxidative metabolites and its conjugate (13%), as well as further unknown metabolites (3%).</seg>
<seg id="1233">In addition to the excretion over the urine, approximately 45% of the dose in the stool was found as an unchanged Febuxostat (12%), Acylglucuronide of the active substance (1%), its known oxidative metabolites and its conjugate (25%) as well as further unknown metabolites (7%).</seg>
<seg id="1234">Special patient groups of renal insufficiency After taking multiple doses of 80 mg ADENURIC in patients with mild, moderate or severe renal insufficiency, the Cmax of Febuxostat did not change in relation to subjects with normal kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="1235">The average total AUC of Febuxostat increased by about 1.8 times of 7.5 m g / ml in the group with normal kidney function to 13.2 μ g / ml in the group with severe kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="1236">12 Liver Function After taking multiple doses of 80 mg ADENURIC in patients with mild (Child- uth-classification A) or moderate (Child-Pugh classification B) Liver function restriction changed the Cmax and AUC of Febuxostat and its metabolites significantly compared to subjects with normal liver function.</seg>
<seg id="1237">Age There were no significant changes in regard to the AUC of Febuxostat or its metabolites after taking multiple oral doses of ADENURIC in older patients compared to younger subjects.</seg>
<seg id="1238">Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility in male rats was found only in connection with Xanthin stones in the highly dosed treated group, approximately 11 times the exposure to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1239">These findings are seen as a result of a specific purine metabolism and urine combination and considered not relevant for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="1240">It has been found that Febuxostat has no effect on the fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1241">At high doses, which were about 3 times the therapeutic exposure, maternal toxicity emerged, which accompanied by a reduction of the rearing performance and a developmental delay in the descendants of rats.</seg>
<seg id="1242">Teratological studies in carrying rats with expositions, approximately 4.3-fold and in carrying rabbits with expositions, which amounted to approximately 13 times of human therapeutic exposure, did not have teratogenic effects.</seg>

<seg id="1258">If you have a gout attack at the moment (sudden occurrence of severe pain, pressure sensitivity, redness, warmth and joint swelling), wait until the gout is cleared before starting treatment with ADENURIC.</seg>
<seg id="1259">This does not have to be the case with everyone, but may also occur with you, especially during the first weeks of treatment or - months, if you are taking ADENURIC.</seg>
<seg id="1260">Your doctor will prescribe other medicines if necessary, in order to prevent the attack or to treat the symptoms associated with it (such as pain and joint swelling).</seg>
<seg id="1261">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you use / apply other medicines or have used / applied recently, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1262">It is particularly important that you inform your doctor or pharmacist if you take drugs / use one of the following substances, since interactions with ADENURIC may occur and your doctor may possibly need to consider necessary measures. • Mercaptopurin (for the treatment of asthma) • Warfarin (for the treatment of asthma) • Warfarin (for blood dilution in heart disease)</seg>
<seg id="1263">No studies have been conducted on the effects of ADENURIC on traffic airtightness and the ability to operate machines.</seg>

<seg id="1275">ADROVANCE is used to treat osteoporosis (a disease where the bones are brittle) in women following menopause where there is a risk of low vitamin D levels.</seg>
<seg id="1276">The patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water (no mineral water) at least 30 minutes before eating, drinking or taking other medicines (including antazida, calcium and vitamin supplements).</seg>
<seg id="1277">In order to avoid irritation of the oesophagus, the patient must not lie down until after the first food intake of the day, which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1278">Since alendronate and vitamin D3 are already used separately in medicines that are approved in the European Union, the company presented data originating from previous studies and published literature.</seg>
<seg id="1279">The company also conducted a study of 35 men and 682 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis in order to demonstrate the efficacy of ADROVANCE in terms of increasing the vitamin D level.</seg>
<seg id="1280">After a 15 week treatment, the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in patients treated with ADROVANCE was lower (11%) compared to those who only received alendronate (32%).</seg>
<seg id="1281">The company also presented data suggesting that the alendronat dose contained in ADROVANCE corresponds exactly to the dose needed to prevent bone loss.</seg>
<seg id="1282">The most common side effects (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are headaches, musculoskeletal pain (muscles, bones or joints) and symptoms of digestive organs such as abdominal pain, dyspepsia (diarrhoea), constipation, diarrhoea (diarrhoea), ulcer (ulcera) of esophagus, dyspepsia (swallowing), broken abdomen (bloated abdomen) as well as sour upset.</seg>
<seg id="1283">ADROVANCE must not be used in patients with any hypersensitivity to alendronate, vitamin D3 or any other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1284">It must not be used in diseases of oesophagus, in patients with hypocalcemia (low calcium levels) or in patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes.</seg>

<seg id="1287">ADROVANCE is to be taken only with water (not with mineral water) at least 30 minutes before the first meal, drink or intake of medicines (including antazida, calcium and vitamin supplements) for the day.</seg>
<seg id="1288">Follow these instructions carefully to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and related side effects (see section 4.4):</seg>
<seg id="1289">• ADROVANCE should be swallowed only with a full glass of water (at least 200 ml) after the day. • Patients should not chew the tablet or leave the tablet in the mouth because there is a risk of oropharyngeal ulcera.</seg>
<seg id="1290">B. peptic ulcer, active gastrointestinal bleedings or surgical procedures in the upper gastrointestinal tract, except pyloroplasty, can only be given under special care (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1291">Esophageal reactions, such as oesophagitis, esophageal ulcera and esophageal erosions, rarely followed by esophageal strokes, were reported in patients under ingestion of alendronate (some were severe and required hospitalization).</seg>
<seg id="1292">The doctor should therefore pay attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible esophageal reactions, and patients should be pointed out when symptoms of ophageal irritation such as dysphagie, pain during swallowing or retrograde pain or new or worsening heartburn the medicine can be deprecated and medical advice should be obtained (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1293">3 The risk of serious ill-hageal side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine properly and / or continue to take it after the occurrence of symptoms pointing to esophageal irritation.</seg>
<seg id="1294">It is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and be understood by the patient (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1295">While in large-scale clinical studies with alendronate no increased risk has been detected, gastric and duodenal ulcera, among them some severe and with complications, were reported (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1296">Osteoarthritis of the jaw, usually associated with tooth extraction and / or a local infection (including osteomyelitis), was reported in cancer patients whose treatment regimen mainly contain intravenous bisphosphonates.</seg>
<seg id="1297">There is no data available to indicate whether the use of bisphosphonate therapy in patients who need a late surgical procedure reduces the risk of osteoarthritis of the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="1298">Clinical assessment by the attending physician is decisive for therapy planning in every patient based on an individual benefit-risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Patients should be instructed that they should take the tablet next morning when taking a dose of ADROVANCE, after they have noticed their failure.</seg>
<seg id="1300">You should not take two tablets the same day, but continue taking one tablet per week as originally planned on the designated day of the week.</seg>
<seg id="1301">Other diseases that affect the metabolism (such as vitamin D deficiency and hypoparathyreoidism) should also be treated adequately before the treatment with ADROVANCE.</seg>
<seg id="1302">Alendronate foods and beverages (including mineral water), calcium supplements, antacids and some oral medicines can affect the resorption of alendronate when taken at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1303">Patients need to wait for at least 30 minutes after taking Alendronat before taking other medicines (see Sections 4.2 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1304">Although specific interaction studies were not conducted, alendronat was taken in clinical trials together with a variety of commonly prescribed drugs without clinically relevant interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1305">ADROVANCE is intended only for use in postmenopausal women and is therefore not applicable neither during pregnancy nor by breastfeeding women.</seg>
<seg id="1306">Animal studies with alendronate do not indicate directly damaging effects with regard to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal or postnatal development.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Osteoarthritis of the jaw was reported in patients with bisphosphonates; most reports stem from cancer patients, but it was also reported in osteoporosis patients.</seg>
<seg id="1308">Nevertheless, taking serum calcium to &lt; 8.0 mg / dl (2.0 mmol / l) and serum phosphate up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl (0.65 mmol / l) occurred in both treatment groups with similar incidence.</seg>

<seg id="1410">Only doctors who are familiar with immunosuppressive therapy and the treatment of transplant patients should prescribe this medicine or make changes in immunosuppressive therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences in the systemic exposure of tacrolimus, this can lead to graft rejection or increased incidence of side effects, including under- or immunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formula and the appropriate daily dosage; changes to the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under close-meshed control of an experienced medical practitioner (see Sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">As a consequence of switching to an alternative formulation, therapeutic pharmaceutical supervision and appropriate dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tacrolimus remains intact.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The dosage of Aagraf should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rejection and tolerability in individual cases and on blood level measurements (see below)</seg>
<seg id="1415">After switching from Prograf to Advance, the Tacrolimus-Talks should be controlled before switching over and over two weeks after conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Systemic exposure, measured as a valley mirror, was comparable to both levels of kidney and liver transplanted patients on day 4.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated checks of Tacrolimus's Talks are recommended during the first two weeks after transplant under advent in order to ensure appropriate substance exposition in the immediate transplant phase.</seg>
<seg id="1418">Since tacrolimus is a low clearances substance, an adjustment of the article can take several days until the Steady State is reached.</seg>

<seg id="1422">Further dose adjustments may later be necessary as the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus can change in the course of the patient's stabilization after transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Dosage recommendations - liver transplantation Prophylaxis of graft rejection The oral advocacy therapy should start at 0.10 - 0.20 mg / kg / day as once daily dosage in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Dosage recommendation - switching from Prograf to Advocagraf Must a transplant recipient of twice daily dosage of Prograf capsules should be converted to a once daily intake of Prograf capsules on a once daily intake of Prograf capsules, this conversion has to take place in the ratio of 1: 1 (mg: mg), related to the entire daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1425">After a change from other immunosuppressiva to advocate once a day, the treatment with the recommended oral initial dose in the case of kidney and liver transplants must commence for the prophylaxis of graft rejection.</seg>
<seg id="1426">A corral initial dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day should be taken once a day in adults with adult patients.</seg>
<seg id="1427">Other transplant recipients, although there is no clinical experience with prostate, pancreas and colon transplanted patients, received Prograf in an oral initial dose of 0.10 - 0.15 mg / kg / day, for patients with pancreatic transplanted patients in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day and in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Dosage adjustment in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function To maintain blood flow in the targeted area can be required in patients with severe liver dysfunctions a reduction of the dose.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced kidney function Since the renal function does not exert an influence on the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus, it can be assumed that dosage adjustment is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1430">However, due to the nephrotoxic potential of tacrolimus, a careful monitoring of the renal function (including a regular determination of serum creatine, a calculation of the creatininin and a monitoring of the urinary volume) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Caution must be advised when migrating from Ciclosporin to a Tacrolimus-based therapy (see Sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">The dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rejection and tolerability in individual cases by means of full blood Tacrolimus-Talmirror controls.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended to carry out frequent checks of tacrolimus levels during the first two weeks after transplant, followed by periodic checks during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood Talks of Tacrolimus should also be controlled after switching from Prograf to Advance, Dosage adjustments, changes in immunosuppressive therapy or simultaneous use of substances that could change the tacrolimus whole blood concentration (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since Aagraf is a drug with a low clearance, adjustments to the dose may take several days until the Steady State has entered.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical studies suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases when the blood level in the blood fails to exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the treatment of tacrolimus in full blood lies in the first time after liver transplantation in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and kidney and heart transplanted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver, kidney and heart transplant recipients, blood concentrations were generally used in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This led to serious adverse events, including graft rejection or other side effects which may occur as a result of tacrolimus under- or overexposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formula and the appropriate daily dosage; changes to the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under close-meshed control of a medical device experienced in transplantation (see Sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 For the treatment of adult patients with graft rejection, which proved to be resistant to other immunosuppressants, clinical data for the retarded formulation was not yet available.</seg>
<seg id="1442">In order to prophylaxis of corneal graft rejection in adult heart transplant recipients and transplant recipients in childhood, no clinical data for the retarded formulation was pending.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Due to possible interactions, which can lead to a reduction of the tacrolimus in the blood and a weakening of the clinical effect of tacrolimus, the intake of herbal supplements, the St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum), or other plant remedies may be avoided during a treatment with advent (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, a particularly careful observation of the tacrolimus concentrations in the blood is required, as the Tacrolimus blood levels can be subject to considerable fluctuations in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, a chamber or septic hypertrophy described as cardiomyopathy was observed under Prograf which can therefore also occur under Advance agraph.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease, a treatment with corticosteroids, high blood pressure, kidney or liver dysfunctions, infections, fluid overload and edema.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosuppressants, exposure to sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of maligner skin changes due to suitable clothing or use of a sunscreen with a high protection factor.</seg>
<seg id="1448">If patients who take Tacrolimus have symptoms for PRES such as headaches, altered state of consciousness, convulsions, and vision disturbances, a radiological examination (e.g.)</seg>
<seg id="1449">As advocates contain hard capsules, retarded, lactose, patients with rare hereditary galactose intolerance, lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption provide special care.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibitors or inductors from CYP3A4 can influence the metabolism of tacrolimus and consequently increase or lower the blood values of tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1451">Therefore, it is recommended to monitor the Tacrolimus blood levels with simultaneous addition of substances that can change the CYP3A metabolism and adjust the tacrolimus dose to maintain equal concentrations (see Sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1452">A strongly pronounced interaction was associated with anti-oxidants such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, Itraconazole and Voriconazole as well as with the macrolid antibiotic, erythromycin, and HIV protease inhibitors (z).</seg>
<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetic studies showed that the rise in blood levels mainly results from the increased oral bio availability of tacrolimus, caused by the inhibition of gastrointestinal metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1454">Highly dosed prednisolone or methyl prednisolone as used in acute rejection reactions can increase or decrease the concentration of tacrolimus in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The effect of tacrolimus on the metabolism of other medications Tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4 inhibition; hence, the simultaneous use of tacrolimus with medicines, which are metabolized by CYP3A4, can impair their metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1456">As tacrolimus can reduce the clearance of steroid contraceptives and thus increase the hormonal exposition, decisions on contraceptive measures should be particularly cautious.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal studies have shown that tacrolimus can potentially reduce the clearance of pentobarbital and phenazone and extend their half-life.</seg>
<seg id="1458">The results of a small number of transplant patients have no indication that under tacrolimus compared to other immunosuppressiva there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and results of pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1459">In utero exposure, a monitoring of the newborn suggests potential adverse effects of tacrolimus (in particular with regard to its effect on the kidneys).</seg>

<seg id="1468">Due to its high molecular weight, low water solubility and high binding of erythrocytes and plasma roteins can be assumed that tacrolimus is not dialysis.</seg>
<seg id="1469">The mechanism of action and pharmacological-dynamic effects on the molecular level should mediate the effects of tacrolimus through its binding to a cytosol protein (FKBP12) which is responsible for the enrichment of the connection in the cell interior.</seg>
<seg id="1470">This leads to a calciumdependent inhibition of signal transduction pathways in the T cell and thus prevents the transcription of a certain series of lymphocytes genes.</seg>

<seg id="1494">Factors such as low haematocrit and low protein concentrations that lead to an increase in the unbound fraction of tacrolimus, or a strengthening of metabolism caused by treatment with corticosteroids, should be responsible for the higher clearing rates observed after transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1495">This suggests that tacrolimus is almost completely metabolized before excretion, whereby excretion is mainly done via the bile.</seg>
<seg id="1496">The systemic exposure of tacrolimus (AUC0-24) was approximately 10% lower than under Prograf for stable patients (once daily) in relation to a total daily dose of 1: 1 (mg: mg) in relation to the total daily dose.</seg>

<seg id="1530">Advocates are used to treat and prevent hemorrhages in patients with haemophilia A (a congenital blood clotting disorder caused by the lack of factor VIII).</seg>
<seg id="1531">The dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether advate is used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding during surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with hemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency, which causes blood clotting problems such as bleeding in the joints, muscles or inner organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma, but is produced using a method called recombinant DNA technology:</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced to enable the formation of the human coagulation factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advocate is similar to another medicine approved in the European Union called Recombinate, but is made differently, so that the medicine does not contain proteins of human or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hemophilia A, including a study of 53 children under six years, the use of the medicine for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures was studied.</seg>
<seg id="1537">In the main study, the efficacy of Advate in the prevention of bleeding into 86% of 510 new blood septic episodes was rated "excellent" or "good."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common side effects of Advate (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are dizziness, headache, pyrexia (fever) and the formation of antibodies to factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Advocates may not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the human odine factor VIII, mouse or witch protein, or one of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission granted the company Baxter AG a permit for the marketing of Advate in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage The dosage and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, according to the location and the extent of the bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1542">In the case of the following hemorrhages, the factor VIII activity should not fall below the indicated plasma levels (in% of the standard or in I.E. / dl).</seg>
<seg id="1543">Injection every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years) for 3-4 days or longer until the pain and acute impairment are removed.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Repeat injections every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years) until the risk is over for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During the course of treatment, a proper determination of the factor VIII plasma levels is recommended for controlling the dose and frequency of injections.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients can differ in their response to factor VIII, achieve different in vivo recovery and exhibit different half-value periods.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 prophylaxis for long-term prophylaxis of hemorrhages in patients with severe hemophilia A should be doses between 20 and 40 I.U. of factor VIII per kg body weight within 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor VIII plasma activity is not reached or if bleeding is not controlled with a reasonable dose, a test must be performed in order to verify an inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective, so that other therapeutic measures have to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The speed of administration should depend on the patient's condition whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutralizing antibodies against factor VIII is a well-known complication in treating patients with hemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always opposed to the procoagulatory activity of factor VIII IgG immunoglobulins, which are quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml plasma via modified Bethesda Assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of developing inhibitors correlates to the extent of exposure to factor VIII, whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure days is greatest and depends on genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In pre-treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 exposure days and an anamnestic known inhibitor development, following conversion from a recombinant Factor VIII product to another, the recurrence of (low) inhibitors was observed.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Due to the rare occurrence of hemophilia A in women, the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lactation do not occur.</seg>
<seg id="1556">The ADRs in the largest number of patients were inhibitors against Factor VIII (5 patients), all with previously untreated patients who have a higher risk of the formation of inhibitors, headache (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available since the initial approval, the CHMP still evaluated the benefit risk assessment as positive, but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, the CHMP has decided on the basis of the ADVATE safety profile, which necessitates a submission of PSURs every 6 months, decided that the authorisation holder should apply for further extension in 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">In December 2008, Gendux Molecular Limited officially approved the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) that the company has withdrawn its application for the marketing of Advexin for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Normally, however, the breast, the brain, the bones or the soft parts (tissue that links other structures in the body, surrounds and supports) are affected.</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a type of virus that has been genetically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">"" "the virus in Advexin is a" "" "Adenovirus" "", "which has been modified so that it cannot produce copies of itself and thus cannot trigger infections in humans." ""</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advexin would have been injected directly into the tumour and thus enable cancer cells to re-form the normal p53 protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein produced from the p53 gene that is not defective in the human body normally contributes to the restoration of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when DNA cannot be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1646">In the case of Li-Fraumeni cancer, with which the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein does not work properly, and the cancer cells can continue to grow and divide.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company presented data from a study with a patient with Li-Fraumeni cancer in the abdomen, bones and brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP had examined the company's answers to the questions posed to him, some questions were still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the review of the initial submitted documents, the CHMP creates a list of questions sent to the company on day 120.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to the CHMP opinion it has not been sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Advexin in Li-Fraumeni-Tumore brings benefits to patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The committee also had concerns about the treatment of the drug in the body, the type of administration and the safety of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that Advexin can be produced in a reliable way and that it is harmful neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company did not inform the CHMP about whether the withdrawal has consequences for patients currently participating in clinical trials or "Compassionate-Use" programmes with Advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "" "" "changed drug release" "" "means that the tablets are composed so that one of the effective components is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours." ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aeronaze is used to treat the symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, inflammation of the nasal pathways caused by pollen) in patients with nasal mucous swelling (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and adolescents from 12 years onwards, the recommended dose of aero aze is twice a day a tablet intended to be taken with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and ended as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (clogged nose), are cloned.</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medicine can be traced to the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main effects were the changes of the severity of the hay fever symptoms, which were reported by the patients before the beginning of treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">Considering all the hay fever symptoms other than the constipation of the nose, the patients who took Aerinaze reported a decrease in symptoms by 46.0%, compared with 35.9% in patients who took pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was seen, the patients with Aerinaze showed a reduction of the symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in patients who received the loratadin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of aero (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are tachycardia (heart chase), dry mouth, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (restlessness), constipation, headache, fatigue, insomnia (somnia), somnolency (sleepiness), sleep disorders and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to desloratadine, pseudoephedrine or any of the other ingredients, against adrenergic active agents or Loratadin (another medicine for the treatment of allergies).</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aeration should also not be used in patients who suffer from severe glaucoma (hypertension), cardiac or vascular diseases including hypertension (hypertension), hyperthyroireosis (hyperthyrosis), hyperthyroireosis (hyperthyrosis) or a hemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission granted the company SP Europe a permit for the marketing of Aerinaze in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water but it is swallowed whole (i.e. without breaking, breaking or chewing).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aeronaze should not be used for children under 12 years due to lack of data on safety and efficacy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is to be kept as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms have been discontinued.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days, as long-term use may decrease the activity of pseudoephedrine with time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory tract, the treatment can be continued as a monotherapy as needed.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since Aerinaze contains pseudoephedrine, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients treated with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor within 2 weeks of ending such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to alphamimetic activity in combined use of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstrictors such as bromocripitin, pergolid, lithophydotamine, cabergolin, ergotamine, dihydroergotamine or other deongestiva that are used perorally or nasal as abnormal rhinocoplasty (phenylpropanolamine, phenylephrine, ephedrine, oxymetazoline, naphazolin, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not tested for this patient subjectivity and the data are not sufficient to address appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and efficacy of Aerinaze have not been tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data are insufficient to address appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed that treating hypertension or tachycardia or palpitations, cardiac arrhythmias, nausea or any other neurological symptoms (such as headache or amplification of headaches) must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="1677">Patients with hypertension • Patients with hypertension • Patients with hypertension • Patients with a myocardial infarction in anamnesis, diabetes mellitus, bladder neck obstruction or bronchospasm in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze is at least 48 hours before the dermatological test is carried out, as antihistamines otherwise inhibit positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions or can be reduced to their extent.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In the course of clinical trials with desloratadin, in which erythromycin or ketoconazole was additionally administered, no clinically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of Desloratadin were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The results of the psychomotor testing showed no significant differences between the patients treated with the placebo and the placebo-treated patients, regardless of whether they were taken alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Desloratadin has not yet been identified, so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="1682">In vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 is not inhibiting and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The harmlessness of the application of aerobics during pregnancy is not assured, however, experience gained from a large number of affected pregnancies did not increase the frequency of abnormalities compared to the frequency of the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproductive studies on animals are not always transmitted to humans and based on the vasoconstrictive properties of pseudoephedrine, aerobics should not be used during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases there may be a dizziness that may lead to impairment of traffic airtightness or the ability to operate machines.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The symptoms may vary between a CNS-depression (sedation, apnea, decreased mental alertness, cyanosis, coma, cardiovascular collapse) and a CNS stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, tremor, convulsions) with possible sequential processes.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headache, anxiety, difficult miction, muscular weakness and increased muscle tension, euphoria, arousal, respiratory insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmia, tachycardia, palpitations, thirst, transpiration, nausea, vomiting, precordial pain, dizziness, tinnitus, ataxia, vision disturbances and hypertension or hypotony.</seg>
<seg id="1688">A CNS stimulation is particularly likely in children, as well as atropine-typical symptoms (dry mouth, pupil stiffness and - dilatation, redness, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include inhibition of the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles as well as inhibiting the expression of the adhesion molecules P-selectivity to endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In a single dose study with adults, Desloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of flight performance including amplification of subjective sleepiness or tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical studies, at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily no increased incidence of drowsiness compared to placebo was observed.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage can produce other sympathetic effects, such as an increase in blood pressure, tachycardia or manifestations of CNS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">There were 1,248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rhinitis, with 414 patients receiving aeronaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies, the histamine-antagonistic efficacy of aeronaze tablets was significantly higher than a single monotherapy with pseudoephedrin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The efficacy of aeronaze tablets with regard to the swelling effect, determined on the basis of nasal mucous swelling, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with desloratadin over the 2 weeks treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The effectiveness of Aerinaze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender, age or ethnicity.</seg>
<seg id="1697">As part of an individual dose study for pharmacokinetics of aerobics, desloratadin is detectable within 30 minutes of administration of the plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the perortal application of aeropaze in healthy subjects over 14 days, the flow equilibrium of Desloratadin, 3-hydroxydesloratadin and pseudoephedrine was reached on day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">As part of a pharmacokinetic multi-dose study carried out with the formulation as a tablet for healthy adult subjects, it was found that four test subjects were poorly metabolized.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interaction study shows that the exposure (Cmax and AUC) of pseudoephedrine was bioequivalent after the sole administration of pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on the conventional research on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, however, preclinical data with Desloratadin do not identify any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination possessed no greater toxicity than its individual components, and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive toxicological studies, the combination of Loratadin / pseudoephedrine was not teratogenic in oral administration of rats in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and in rabbits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>

<seg id="1721">For children aged six to eleven years, the dose is 2.5 mg once a day, either in the form of 5 ml syrup or honey.</seg>
<seg id="1722">Aerius was examined in a total of eight studies with approximately 4,800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (including four trials in seasonal allergic rhinitis and two studies of patients who also had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">The effectiveness has been measured by determining the change in the symptoms (itching, number and size of the quadranches, sleep and performance in the day) before and after six weeks of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies have been presented to prove that the body uses the syrup, the solution to take-in and the melt tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is safe.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In case of allergic rhinitis, when the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg Aerius resulted in an average decrease of the symptom scores (symptom scores) by 25 to 32%, compared to the decrease of 12 to 26% in the patients receiving a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In the two trials of Urticaria, the decrease of the symptom scores after six weeks of treatment with Aerius 58 and 67% was compared with 40 and 33% in patients treated with placebo.</seg>

<seg id="1730">There is limited experience from clinical trials for efficacy in the application of desloratadine in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years (see Sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">The treatment of the intermittent allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks) should be performed according to the previous course of the disease and can be terminated after the symptoms have been discontinued and resumed after reacting.</seg>
<seg id="1732">In case of persistent allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks), a continuous treatment can be recommended to the patient during the allergy period.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with Desloratadin tablets, in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally given (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical pharmacological study, while taking Aerius and alcohol was not enhanced the performance-reducing effect of alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>

<seg id="1736">Clinical trials in various indications including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3% more side effects in patients with Aerius than in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most common side effects reported in placebo were fatigue (1.2%), dry mouth (0.8%) and headache (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study involving 578 youthful patients from 12 to 17 years, the most common side effect was headaches, this occurred at 5.9% of patients treated with loratadine and in 6.9% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">In a multi-dose study where up to 45 mg of desloratadin (nine-fold clinical dose) were administered, no clinically relevant effects were observed.</seg>

<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis may also be divided into intermittent allergic rhinitis and persistent allergic rhinitis, depending on the duration of the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1746">An intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persistent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As shown in the overall results of the questionnaire on quality of life near Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronically idiopathic urticaria was investigated on behalf of further forms of urticaria because the underlying pathophysiology, notwithstanding the etiology of the different forms, is similar and chronic patients can be easily prospectively recruited.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since histamine irritation is a causative factor in all urinary diseases, it is expected that in addition to chronic idiopathic urticaria, there is also an improvement in symptoms in other forms of urticaria; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials for 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving Pruritus and the reduction of size and number of dles at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamines in chronically idiopathic urticaria, the minority of patients who did not respond to antihistamines was excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">Improvement of the itch by more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with placebo compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">The treatment with Aerius significantly reduced the disturbance of sleep and waking, as measured by a 4-point scale for evaluating these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetic study, where patients were comparable to the general seasonal allergic rhinitis population, 4% of patients achieved a higher concentration of Desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no indications for clinically relevant cumulation after once daily use of desloratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Desloratadin has not yet been identified, so that interactions with other medicines are not completely excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1758">In-vivo studies, Desloratadin does not inhibit CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 is not inhibiting and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dose study with desloratadin in a dose of 7.5 mg, meals (fatty, calorie rich breakfast) did not affect the availability of Desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1760">The preclinical studies conducted with Desloratadin and Loratadin showed no qualitative or quantitative differences with respect to the toxicity profile of Desloratadin and Loratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Based on conventional research on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data with Desloratadin do not identify any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1762">Coloured film (contains lactose monohydrate, hypromole, titanium dioxide, Macrogol 400, Indigocarmine (E 132)), colourless film (contains hypromole, Macrogol 400), carnauba wax, light wax.</seg>
<seg id="1763">Aerius can be taken independently of the meals to relieve symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The prescribing physician should be aware that most cases of rhinitis in children under 2 years are caused by an infection (see section 4.4) and that no data exists which support a treatment of an infectious Rhinitis with Aerius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">Apart from the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatomical anomalies, the diagnosis of anamnesis, physical examinations and corresponding laboratory and skin tests should play a role in the diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="1766">About 6% of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metabolize and experience a higher substance load (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">The safety of Aerius syrup in children between 2 and 11 years, which is restricted to metabolic, is identical to that of children who metabolize normally.</seg>
<seg id="1768">This medicine contains sucrose and sorbitol; therefore, patients with hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-lactose absorption or sucrose isomaltase- insufficiency of this medicine should not be taken.</seg>
<seg id="1769">Clinically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with Aerius tablets, in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally given (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1770">In a clinical pharmacological study, while taking Aerius tablets and alcohol was not enhanced the performance-reducing effect of alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1771">The overall frequency of adverse events in children aged 2 to 11 was similar to the Aerius syrup group similar to the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in different indications including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria were reported at the recommended dose 3% more side effects in patients with Aerius than in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1773">In a multi-dose study of adults and adolescents with up to 45 mg of desloratadin (nine-fold clinical dose), no clinically relevant effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1774">Children aged between 1 and 11 who came into question for antihistamine therapy received a daily loss dose of 1.25 mg (between 1 and 5 years) or 2.5 mg (aged between 6 and 11 years).</seg>
<seg id="1775">Because the course of allergic rhinitis / chronic idiopathic urticaria and the profile of Desloratadin are similar in adults and children, the efficacy data of Desloratadin in adults can be extrapolated to the children's population.</seg>
<seg id="1776">As part of a clinical study involving multiple doses of adults and adolescents in which Desloratadin was administered in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1777">In a clinical pharmacological study of adults and adolescents, in which desloratadin was used in a dose of 45 mg daily (the nine times the clinical dose) was applied for ten days in adults, no extension of the Qtc interval was shown.</seg>
<seg id="1778">In controlled clinical studies, at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents, there was no increased incidence of drowsiness compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1779">During a single daily dose of 7.5 mg, Aerius tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical trials were not impaired by psychomotor disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1780">In clinical pharmacological studies in adults, the simultaneous intake of alcohol was neither an increase in alcohol-induced deterioration of the performance nor an increase in drowsiness.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In adult and adolescent patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius tablets were effective in alleviating symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, tears of tears and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1782">As shown in the overall results of the questionnaire on quality of life near Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius tablets effectively reduce the caused by seasonal changes in rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1783">In two placebo-controlled trials for 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving Pruritus and the reduction of size and number of dles at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The proliferation of this restricted pathological phenotype was similar to adults (6%) and children aged 2 to 11 (6%) and in both populations bigger in black (18% adults, 16% children) than in Caucasians (2% adults, 3% children).</seg>
<seg id="1785">Similar pharmacokinetic parameters were observed in a pharmacokinetic multi-dose study with the syrup formulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhinitis, which are restricted.</seg>
<seg id="1786">The load (AUC) by Desloratadin was approximately 6times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the Cmax 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half-life of approximately 120 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1787">There are no indications for clinically relevant drug accumulation after once daily use of desloratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days in adults and adolescents.</seg>
<seg id="1788">12 In various single dose studies, the AUC- and Cmax values of desloratadin in pediatric patients were comparable to those of adults who received desloratadin syrup in a dose of 5 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1789">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Desloratadin has not yet been identified, so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out.</seg>

<seg id="1811">The efficacy and safety of Aerius 2.5 mg of fusion tablets during the treatment of children under 6 years have not been proven until now.</seg>
<seg id="1812">The overall frequency of adverse events between the placebo group and the placebo group was the same and did not differ significantly from the safety profile observed in adult patients.</seg>
<seg id="1813">At the recommended dose, Aerius processed processed tablets as a bioequivalent to the Aerius 5 mg conventional tablets formulation and the Aerius 5 mg lyophilisate for the decreasing formulation of Desloratadin.</seg>

<seg id="1815">In a single dose study with adults, Desloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of flight performance including amplification of subjective sleepiness or tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1816">The spread of this poorly-metabolizing phenotype was comparable to adult (6%) and paediatric patients between 2 and 11 years (6%), and in blacks (adults 18%, children 16%), the safety profile of these patients was not different from that of the general population.</seg>
<seg id="1817">In single-dose crossover trials of Aerius Melting tablet with Aerius 5 mg conventional tablets or Aerius 5 mg lyophilisate, the formulations were bioequivalent.</seg>

<seg id="1830">The safety of loratadine in children between 2 and 11 years, which is restricted to metabolic, is identical to that in children who metabolize normally.</seg>
<seg id="1831">This medicine contains sorbitol; therefore, patients with hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose-absorption or sucrose isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicine.</seg>

<seg id="1895">This is a special type of vaccine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A flu pandemic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus appears, which can easily spread from man to person, because people have not built immunity (no protection) against it.</seg>
<seg id="1897">After the vaccine is administered, the immune system recognises the parts of the influenza virus contained in the vaccine as "foreign" and forms antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">As a result, the immune system will later be able to produce antibodies against this common influenza virus in contact with a flu virus.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently, the membrane shell of the virus with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface, recognises the human body as foreign-foreign), was purified and used as a constituent of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">"" "a survey of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out according to" "" "good clinical practice" "" "(GCP)." ""</seg>
<seg id="1901">The scope of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the EMEA guidelines for pre-pandemic vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Should you take part in a clinical trial and need more information about your treatment, please contact your attending doctor.</seg>
<seg id="1903">If you would like more information regarding the CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="1904">It is used in combination with other antiviral medicines to treat adults and children over four years which are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), which causes the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).</seg>
<seg id="1905">For patients unable to swallow the capsules, agenera is available as a solution to take-in, but it cannot be taken together with Ritonavir since the safety of this combination has not been studied.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Agenera should only be prescribed when the doctor has examined the antiviral medicines of the patient before, and has judged the likelihood of the virus to respond to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily, taken together with twice a day 100 mg of ritonavir and with other antiviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1908">For children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of Agenerase is based on body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">Agenerase reduces the amount of HIV in the blood when combined with other antiviral medicines and keeps them at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">Aids does not cure AIDS, however, can delay the damage to the immune system and thereby also the development of HIV-related infections and diseases.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenera was studied in combination with other antiviral medicines but without ritonavir, in two main studies of 736 HIV-infected adults who had not previously been treated with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1912">The treatment of low-dose kritonavir increased in 206 adults, formerly occupied with protease inhibitors, compared to other protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non-detectable levels of HIV in the blood (viral load) or the modification of the viral load after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies with patients who had previously had no protease inhibitors, more patients had a viral load under 400 copies / ml than placebo, but Agenerase was less effective than indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenera reduced the viral load, however, with the children who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors, only very few responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors, the treatment with ritonavir increased the viral load after 16 weeks treatment as effectively as other protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other protease inhibitors, Agenera combined with kritonavir increased the viral load after four weeks as in patients who continued their previous protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of Agenerase (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are headaches, diarrhoea, flatulence (diarrhea), nausea, vomiting, rash and fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 A generaliase must not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive to amponavir or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1920">It may not be used in patients, the St. John's wort (an herbal supplement for the treatment of depression) or drugs that are broken down just like Agenera and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines for HIV, patients who take aetiasis take the risk of lipodystrophy (changes in the distribution of body fat), osteoarthritis (death of bone tissue) or an immune activation syndrome (symptoms of infection caused by the recovering immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the advantages of Agenerase in combination with other antiretroviral drugs used in combination with other antiretroviral drugs for the treatment of HIV-1-infected adults and children over four years have outweighed the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Agenera is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetic amplifier Ritonavir, but the committee found that the use of Agenera in combination with kritonavir in patients who had previously not taken protease inhibitors is not proven.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"" "Agenera was originally supposed to be" "" "exceptional circumstances" "" "because only limited information was available for scientific reasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission granted the Glaxo Group Limited its approval for the marketing of Agenera in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Agenerase is shown in combination with other antiretroviral medications for the treatment of HIV-1, proteasinhibitor (PI) -pre-treated adults and children from 4 years onwards.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Usually Agenera capsules should be administered to pharmacokinetic booster of Amprenavir together with low doses of kritonavir (see Sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of Amprenavir should take place taking into account the individual viral resistance pattern and the pretreatment of the patient (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of Amprenavir as a solution to intake is 14% lower than from Amprenavir as a capsule; therefore, Agenera capsules and solution for taking on a milligram per milligram base are not interchangeable (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agenera capsules is 600 mg of Amprenavir twice a day together with 100 mg of kritonavir twice a day in combination with other antiretroviral medications.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If asterase capsules are used without the intensifying addition of kritonavir (booster), higher doses of asterase (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg of Amprenavir / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of amponavir, which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">Pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of agenera combined with low doses of kritonavir or other protease inhibitors were not studied in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Agenera is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age due to lack of data for safety and efficacy (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetic data, the dose of Agenera capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily in adult patients with moderate liver function disorder up to 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The simultaneous use should be treated with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction, in patients with severe liver dysfunctions it is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Asgenera must not be given at the same time with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and also represent mediums of the Cytochrom P450-Isodic enzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal preparations containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of amponavir while taking Amprenavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be advised that Agenera or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure of the HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy, including treatment with Agenerase, does not prevent the risk of transmission from HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Generally Agenera capsules should be used together with low doses of kritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral drugs (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with antiretroviral therapy have an increased risk of severe liver damage with potentially deadly histories.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the case of simultaneous antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C, please read the relevant specialist information of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with pre-existing liver function including chronic-active hepatitis show an increased incidence of liver dysfunctions under antiretroviral therapy and should be monitored in accordance with clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous use of Agenerase and kritonavir with fluticasone or other glucocorticoids, which can be metabolized via CYP3A4, is not recommended unless the possible benefit of a treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroids including morbus Cushing and suppresection of the adrenal function (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Since the metabolism of the HMG CoA reductase inhibitor Lovastatin and Simvastatin is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, a simultaneous administration of Agenera with Lovastatin and Simvastatin is not recommended because of the increased risk of myopathies including rhabdomyolysis.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines which may cause serious or life-threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under the supervision of the International Regular Ratio), methods are available to determine the drug concentration.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients taking this medicine at the same time, agenera may be less effective due to reduced plasma levels of Amprenavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with Amprenavir, the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives can be altered, however the information is insufficient to estimate the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadone is also given to Amprenavir at the same time, patients should therefore be monitored on opium withdrawal symptoms, especially if low doses of kritonavir are administered.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Due to the potential risk of toxicity due to the high propylene glycol content of the Agenerase solution, this formulation is contraindicated in children under a age of four years and should be used with care in certain other patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Agenera should be set to 5, if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mucous membranes are involved (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">Patients who received antiretroviral therapy including proteasinhibitors were reported on the occurrence of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia or an exacerbation of an existing diabetes mellitus.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other diseases that were needed to treat medications that are associated with the development of diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. increased age, and associated with drug-dependent factors, such as a prolonged antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1956">In hemophilic patients (Type A and B) treated with protease inhibitors, reports of an increase in hemorrhages including spontaneous cutaneous hematomas and hemorrhosis occur.</seg>
<seg id="1957">In cases of HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect, an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections can develop, leading to severe clinical conditions or worsening of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although a multi-factorial etiology is assumed (including application of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteoarthritis were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long-term application of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with low therapeutic width agenera must not be given at the same time with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and can also display mediums of the Cytochrom P450-Isocylinder 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with low therapeutic width Agenerase with kritonavir must not be combined with medicines whose active ingredients are mainly metabolized via CYP2D6 and are associated with increased plasma levels with serious and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It has been shown that Rifampicin causes a 82% decrease in the AUC by Amprenavir, which can lead to virological failure and resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In the attempt to compensate the reduced plasma levels by a dose increase of other protease inhibitors in combination with kritonavir, adverse effects on the liver were often observed.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The serum mirror of Amprenavir can be reduced by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient is already registered in the Johanniskraut, the amponavirus level and, if possible, check the viral load and replace the carob.</seg>
<seg id="1965">Dosage adjustment for one of the drugs is not necessary if nelfinavir is administered together with Amprenavir (see also Efavirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% higher, whereas Cmax decreases by 30% if kritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with Amprenavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical trials, doses of 600 mg of amponavir were used twice a day and kritonavir 100 mg twice daily which prove the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% lower if Amprenavir (750 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with calcium (400 mg of Lopinavir + 100 mg of kritonavir twice a day).</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of Amprenavir in plasma achieved in combination with Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) with Kaletra (400 mg of Lopinavir + 100 mg of kritonavir twice daily) are approximately 40 to 50% lower than when Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of kritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Amprenavir and Kaletra can not be given, but a close-meshed monitoring is recommended, as the effectiveness and harmlessness of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">There was no pharmacokinetic study carried out in combination with dialysis in combination with Didanosin, however, due to the fanciful component of Didanosin it is recommended that the revenues of Didanosin and Agenerase are at least one hour apart (see Antazida below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, when using Efavirenz in combination with Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) and kritonavir (100 mg twice daily), no dose adjustment is required.</seg>
<seg id="1973">The treatment with Efavirenz in combination with Amprenavir and Saquinavir is not recommended since the exposure of both proteasinhibitors would be low.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effects of Nevirapin on other proteasinhibitors and existing limited data suggest that nevirapine may possibly lower the serum concentration of Amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If this medicine should be used at the same time, caution is advisable because Delavirdine may be less effective because of the reduced or possibly subtherapeutic plasma levels.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If these drugs are used together, caution is required; thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be carried out as precise prediction of the effect of the combination of Amprenavir and kritonavir on Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous administration of amponavir and rifabutin caused an increase in plasma concentration (AUC) of rifabutin by 193%, resulting in an increase in side effects associated with rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer rifabutin together with Agenera, a reduction in the dose of rifabutin will be reduced to at least half of the recommended dose, although there are no clinical data available for this.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with erythromycin in combination with erythromycin were not performed, but the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg of ketoconazole with 200 mg ketoconazole once daily led to an increase in the Cmax of ketoconazole in plasma by 25% and the AUC (0-τ) to 2.69fold compared to the value observed after 200 mg ketoconazole once a day without simultaneous use of Fosamrenavir with kritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines that are listed below, including mediums, inhibitors or inductors from CYP3A4 may possibly cause interactions when used together with Agenera.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions related to these drugs if used in combination with agenera.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other protease inhibitors, it is advisable that Antazida should not be taken at the same time as Agenerase since it can cause resorption disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Simultaneous use of anticonvulsants known as enzyme inductors (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), with Amprenavir can lead to a degradation of the plasma levels of Amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">The serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as Amlodipine, Diltiazem, riodipine, Nifedipin, Nifedipin, Nifedipin, Nifedipin, Nifedipin, Nifedipin, Nifedipin, Nifedipin, Nifedipin, Nifedipin, Nifedipin, Nifedipin, Nifedipin, Nifedipin, Nifedipin, Nifedipin, Nifedipin, Nifedipin, Nifedipin, Nifedipin, Nifedipin, Nifedipin, Nifedipin, Nifedipin, Nifedipin, Nifedipin, Nifedipin, Nifedipin, Nifedipin, Nifedipin, Nifedipin, Nifedipin, Nifedipin, Nifedipin, Nifedipin, Nifedipin, Nifedipin, Nifedipin, Nifedipin, Nifedipin, Nifedipin, Nifedipin</seg>
<seg id="1986">Simultaneous intake with asonase can increase their plasma concentrations and strengthen with PDE5 inhibitors in conjunction with side effects including hypotension, vision disturbances and priapism (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study, in which kritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µg of fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days of subjects, the Fluorticasonpropionate plasma levels increased significantly, while the endogenous cortisol decreased by about 86% (90% confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, the simultaneous administration of azionnavir together with these glucocorticoids is not recommended unless the potential benefit of a treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroids (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">HMG CoA reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose metabolism is highly dependent on CYP3A4, are pronounced increases in plasma levels while conserving assays.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Since plasma level increases of these HMG CoA reductase inhibitors can lead to myopathy, including a rhabdomyolysis, the combined use of these drugs with Amprenavir is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1991">Frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations to stabilization of the mirrors is recommended as plasma concentrations of cyclosporine, rapamycin and tacrolimus can be increased with simultaneous administration of amponavir (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, Agenerase should not be used together with an orally-recorded midazolam (see section 4.3), while simultaneous use of Agenera with parenteral midazolam is advisable.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for simultaneous use of parenteral midazolam with other proteaseinhibitors point to a possible increase in the plasma levels of Midazolam around 3 to 4 times.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If methadone is administered together with Amprenavir, patients should therefore be monitored on opium withdrawal symptoms, especially if low doses of kritonavir are administered.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Because of the low reliability of historical comparisons, there is no recommendation at the moment how to adapt the AMdynamavir- dose if Amprenavir is administered simultaneously with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">With simultaneous administration of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants along with Agenera, increased control of INR (International Regulated Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or strengthening the antithrombotic effect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional dosage of kritonavir on hormonal contraceptives is not predictable, so alternative methods for contraception are also recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. desipramine and nortryptilin) is recommended concurrent offering of Agenera (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">During pregnancy, this drug may be used only after careful weighing of the potential benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">Lactavir-related substances have been detected in milk lactate, but it is not known whether Amprenavir translates into breast milk.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproduction study of pregnant rats, which was administered by the nistination in the uterus to the end of the lactation period, showed a diminished increase in 12 body weight during breastfeeding.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The further development of seed, including fertility and reproductive capacity, was not affected by the administration of Amprenavir to the dam.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The harmlessness of Agenera was studied in adults and in children over 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral medications.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most of the side effects associated with the Agenerase treatment were mild to moderate, early on and rarely led to the treatment of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2005">Many of these events have not been clarified whether they are in connection with taking Agenera or another medicine used for HIV treatment, or whether they are a consequence of underlying disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the side effects listed below come from two clinical trials (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), in which patients with proteasinhibitors received 1200 mg Agenerase twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (degree 2 to 4) which were evaluated by the investigators as in connection with the study medication and performed in more than 1% of patients, as well as laboratory changes occurring in the treatment (grade 3 to 4) are listed.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Antiretroviral therapy was associated with a redistribution of the body fat (lipodystrophy) in HIV patients, including a loss of peripheral and visceral fatty tissue, hypertrophy of the breasts and thoracic fat accumulation (breastfeeding).</seg>
<seg id="2009">Among 113 antiretroviral non-pretreated persons who had been treated with Amprenavir in combination with lamivudine / zidovudine over an average duration of 36 weeks, only one case (breastfeeding) (&lt; 1%) was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the study PROAB 3006, in comparison to 27 cases (3%) in patients treated with NSC 631570 (11%) in 241 patients (11%) in 241 patients (11%), in combination with various NRTIs over a mean duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0.001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Skin rashes were usually mild to moderate, erythematous or maculomatous nature, with or without itching and usually occurred during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without having to cancel the treatment with Amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Osteoarthritis cases were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors, advanced HIV infection or long-term use of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">In cases of HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect, an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections can be developed at the time of initiation of antiretroviral therapy (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">Patients who received 600 mg Agenerase twice a day together with low dosed kritonavir (100 mg twice daily) were comparable; the incidence of triglyceride and CPK values observed in patients who received asterase along with low dosed kritonavir were very common.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In case of overdosing, the patient is to observe signs of an intoxication (see section 4.8), if necessary, necessary supportive measures can be initiated.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Amprenavir binds to the active center of the HIV-1 protease and thereby prevents the process of viral gene and gag pol- polenta-protein precursors with the result of a formation of unripe, non-infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The antiviral activity of Amprenavir in vitro for HIV-1 IIIB was studied in acute and chronic lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) as well as peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% Hemmkonzentration (IC50) of Amprenavir is in the range from 0.012 to 0.08 µM with acute infected cells and amounts to 0.41 µM in chronically infected cells.</seg>
<seg id="2019">The connection between the activity of Amprenavir versus HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibition of HIV-1 replication in humans is not yet defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment of antiretroviral non-pretreated patients with currently approved fossils / kritonavir doses - as with other kritonavir-based treatment schemes with proteaseinhibitors - the mutations described only rarely were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In sixteen of 434 antiretroviral non-pretreated patients who received 700mg. Fosamrenavir twice a day in the ESS100732 study, a virological failure occurred up to week 48, whereby 14 isolates could be genotypically examined.</seg>
<seg id="2022">Genotypic analysis of the 13 of 14 children in whom virological failure occurred within the 59, with protease inhibitors of non-untreated patients showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults.</seg>
<seg id="2023">L10F / I / V, V11I, I13V, K20R, V32I, L33F, E34Q, M36I, I50V, I54L / M / T / V, I54L / M / T / V, I54L / M / T / V, I82A / I, I84V, I85V, L90M and I93L / M.</seg>
<seg id="2024">In the APV30003 study and its extension APV30005 (700 mg of fosamprenavir / 100 mg of kritonavir twice daily: n = 107) of patients treated with protease inhibitors occurred in patients with virological failure over 96 weeks, following protease inhibitor mutations:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Genotypical resistance testing based analysis systems can be used to estimate the activity of amponavir / kritonavir or Fosamrenavir / kritonavir in patients with proteasinhibitor-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for Fosamrenavir / kritonavir defines resistance as the presence of mutations V32I + 147a / V, I62V, M36I, I62V, M36I, I84V and L90M in conjunction with increased phenotypic resistance to fosamprenavir with kritonavir and a decreased likelihood of virological response (resistance).</seg>
<seg id="2027">The conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mutations or mutation patterns may be subject to changes by additional data, and it is recommended to always consult the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Based on phenotypic resistance tests Clinical validated phenotypic interpretation systems can be used in combination with genotypic data to estimate the activity of amponavir / kritonavir or Fosamrenavir / kritonavir in patients with proteasinhibitor-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies that sell diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinically-phenotypical cut-offs (separation points) for FPV / RTV which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four with reduced sensitivity to amponavir associated genetic patterns creates a certain cross-resistance to kritonavir, the sensitivity to indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir remains generally preserved.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data about cross-resistance between Amprenavir and other proteasinhibitors for all 4 Fosamrenavir resistance paths, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">On the basis of twenty-five antiretroviral non-pretreated patients, in which a Fosantivirus-containing scheme failed (one of them showed resistance to Lopinavir and saquinavir (three out of 25 isolates), indinavir / kritonavir (three of 25 isolates), indinavir / kritonavir (three of 25 isolates), indinavir / kritonavir (three out of 24 insulates), saquinavir (three out of 24 insulates), saquinavir (three out of 24 insulates) and Tipranavir / kritonavir (four out of 24 insulates).</seg>
<seg id="2033">Conversely, Amprenavir retains its activity against some other proteasinhibitors-resistant isolates; maintaining this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The early departure of a promising therapy is recommended in order to limit the accumulation of a variety of mutations that can adversely affect subsequent treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The evidence of the effectiveness of Agenerase in combination with kritonavir 100 mg twice a day is based on the study PRO30017, a randomised open study, in which patients treated with PI (100 mg twice daily) and nucleoside aloga (NRTI) or a standard of care (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, predominantly with low dosed kritonavir, "received.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred threescore (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to agenera, at least one PI and at least one NRTI were included in the A of PRO30017 study.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis assessed the non-supremacy of APV / kritonavir compared to the SOC-PI group in plasma after 16 weeks in plasma load (HIV-1 RNA) in plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-subgrade threshold of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The evidence of the efficacy of unbiased asterase is based on two uncontrolled studies involving 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18, of which 152 had been pre-treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies Agenerase was examined twice daily, 20 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">No low-dose chionavir was given at the same time; the majority of patients treated with PI had at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs agreed together with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks, approximately 25% of the patients enrolled in the study had a plasma-HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase in CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="2042">"" "19 Based on this data, the expected benefit of" "" "unbundled" "" "asonase should be considered in the treatment optimisation of children treated with PI." ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">After oral administration, the medium duration (Tmax) amounts to approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% higher, for Cmax by 30% lower, if kritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered together with Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">Administration of Amprenavir with a meal results in a 25% decrease in AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of Amprenavir 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore, the minimum concentration at the Steady State (Cmin, ss) was unaffected by dietary intake, although the simultaneous intake of food influences the extent and rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l (6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg) and can be connected to a large distribution volume as well as an unhindered penetration of the blood circulation into the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the overall concentration of the active substance in the plasma, whereby the amount of unbound ampere-avir representing the active part remains probably unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While absolute concentration of inbound ampere-avir remains constant, the percentage share of the free active component fluctuates during the dosing interval in dependence on the overall drug concentration in the Steady State over the range of Cmax, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, drugs that induce or inhibit CYP3A4 respectively or present a substrate of CYP3A4 must be administered with caution when given at the same time with Agenerase (see Sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of Agenerase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day, leads to similar daily amponavir exposure just as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Amprenavir is out of the solution 14% less bioavailability than from the capsules; therefore Agenerase Solution and Agenerase capsules are not replaceable on a milligrammbasis.</seg>
<seg id="2053">The renal clearing of kritonavir is also negligible, so the effect of renal dysfunction should be limited to the elimination of amponavir and kritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These treatment schemes lead to amponavir plasma levels similar to those obtained from healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of Amprenavir twice a day without the simultaneous administration of kritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies for carcinogenicity with amponavir in mice and rats, hepatocellular adenomas were used in male animals, which corresponded to the 2.0-fold (mice) or 3.8-fold (rat) of the exposure to humans, after twice daily administration of 1200 mg of amponavir.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas has not yet been clarified and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">However, there was little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings from the exposure data on humans, both from clinical studies and the therapeutic application.</seg>
<seg id="2058">In a standard battery of in-vivo and in vitro genotoxicity tests, the bacterial cell reverse mutation tests, mouse lymphom test, microkernel tests on rats and chromosomal aberrations in human peripheral lymphocytes were neither mutagenic nor genotoxic.</seg>
<seg id="2059">This liver toxicity can be monitored and proven in clinical daily life by measuring AST, ALT and the activity of alkaline phosphatase.</seg>
<seg id="2060">Until now, no significant liver toxicity has been observed in patients, neither during the administration of Agenera nor after the end of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2061">Studies on toxicity in juveniles that were treated at an age of 4 days showed high mortality in both the control animals and the animals treated with amponavir.</seg>
<seg id="2062">In systemic plasma exposition, which lay significantly below (rabbits) or not significantly higher (rats) than expected exposure under therapeutic dosage in humans, however, a number of minor changes including thymoelongation and minor skeletal changes were observed, which point to delayed development.</seg>
<seg id="2063">24 If asterase capsules are used without the intensifying addition of kritonavir (booster), higher doses of asterase (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="2064">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg of Amprenavir / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of amponavir, which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Concurrent application should be treated with caution in patients with mild or mild liver dysfunction, in patients with severe liver dysfunctions it is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2066">26 For some medicines which may cause serious or life-threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under the supervision of the International Regular Ratio), methods are available to determine the drug concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2067">Agenera should be set to 27 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mucous membranes are involved (see section 4.8).</seg>

<seg id="2071">The Cmin values of Amprenavir in plasma achieved in combination with Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) with Kaletra (400 mg of Lopinavir + 100 mg of kritonavir twice daily) are approximately 40 to 50% lower than when Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of kritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Amprenavir and Kaletra can not be given, but a close-meshed monitoring is recommended, as the effectiveness and harmlessness of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="2073">The treatment with Efavirenz in combination with Amprenavir and Saquinavir is not recommended since the exposure of both proteasinhibitors would be low.</seg>
<seg id="2074">If these drugs are used together, caution is required; thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be carried out as precise prediction of the effect of the combination of Amprenavir and kritonavir on Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>

<seg id="2078">With simultaneous administration of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants along with Agenera, increased control of INR (International Regulated Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or strengthening the antithrombotic effect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2079">Simultaneous administration of Ortho-Novum 1 / 35 (0,035 mg ethinyl estradiol plus 1,0 mg norethindron) led to an acceptance of the AUC and Cmin by Amprenavir by 22% or more.</seg>

<seg id="2084">The antiviral activity of Amprenavir in vitro for HIV-1 IIIB was studied in acute and chronic lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) as well as peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2085">The 50% Hemmkonzentration (IC50) of Amprenavir is in the range from 0.012 to 0.08 µM with acute infected cells and amounts to 0.41 µM in chronically infected cells (1 µM = 0.50 µg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2086">Conversely, Amprenavir retains its activity against some other proteasinhibitors-resistant isolates; maintaining this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>

<seg id="2102">In addition, as there is no dose recommendation for the simultaneous use of Agenerase solution for intake and low dosed kritonavir, this combination should be avoided in these patient populations.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Although dosage adjustment for Amprenavir is not considered necessary, an application of Agenerase is contraindicated in patients with kidney failure (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2104">Due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of high propylene glycollagen, Agenerase is contraindicated for use in infants and children under 4 years, in pregnant women, in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure.</seg>

<seg id="2179">In all studies, Aldara was more effective than placebo. • In the treatment of warts in the genital area, the full recovery rate in all four main studies was 15% to 52% in patients treated with placebo, but only 3% to 18% in patients treated with placebo. • The results of both studies on basal cell carcinomas showed a complete recovery rate of 66% to 80% in patients treated with Aldara compared to 0% to 3% in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="2180">The most common side effects of aldara (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are reactions to the application of cream (pain or itching).</seg>
<seg id="2181">Clinically typical, non-hyperkeratotic, non-hypertrophic actinic keratoses (AKs) in the face or on the scalp in immunocompetent adults if the size or number of lesions limit the efficacy and / or the acceptance of cryotherapy and other topical treatment options are contraindicated or less suitable.</seg>

<seg id="2183">The treatment with imiquimod cream continues until all visible tendencies in the genital or perianal area have disappeared, or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="2184">An interruption in the course of treatment described above should be considered when intense local inflammation reactions occur (see section 4.4) or if an infection is observed in the treatment area.</seg>
<seg id="2185">If in follow-up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period the treated lesions are only incomplete, another therapy should be started (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2186">If a dose has been omitted, the patient should wear the cream as soon as he / she notices this and then continue with the usual therapy plan.</seg>
<seg id="2187">Rub the imiquimod cream in a thin layer and rub in the cleaned, infected skin area until the cream is completely absorbed.</seg>
<seg id="2188">There should be a balance between the benefit of treatment with Imiquimod and the risk associated with a possible worsening of their autoimmune disease.</seg>
<seg id="2189">There should be a balance between the benefit of treatment with Imiquimod and the risk associated with possible organ rejection or graft vs. host response.</seg>
<seg id="2190">In other studies, in which no daily preharity was performed, two cases of severe phimosis and a case with circumcision leading to circumcision were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2191">There is an increased risk of severe local skin irritation when using imiquimod-cream in higher than the recommended doses (see section 4.2.) In rare cases, severe local skin irritations were observed, which necessitated a treatment and / or caused a temporary physical impairment.</seg>
<seg id="2192">In cases where such reactions occured at the exit of the urethra, some women had difficulties in urination which necessitated an emergency catheterisation and treatment of the affected area.</seg>
<seg id="2193">Until now, no clinical experience has been available for the use of imiquimod-cream after treatment with other cutaneous injections in the genital and perianal area.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Although limited data indicates an increased rate of event reductions in HIV positive patients, Imiquimod Creme has shown in this group of patients with regard to eliminating the cowards, however, a lower effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="2195">The treatment of basal cell carcinoma with Imiquimod within 1 cm around the eyelids, nose, lips or hair approach has not been studied.</seg>
<seg id="2196">Local skin reactions are frequent, but the intensity of these reactions usually decreases during therapy or the reactions form after completion of treatment with Imiquimod-cream.</seg>
<seg id="2197">If it is necessary because of the patient's complaints or due to the severity of the local skin reactions, a treatment break can be made for several days.</seg>
<seg id="2198">The clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2199">As there are currently no data available on long-term cure rates of more than 36 months after treatment, other suitable forms of therapy should be considered in superficial basal cell carcinomas.</seg>
<seg id="2200">There are no clinical experience in patients with recurrent and previously treated BCCs, therefore the application is not recommended for pre-treated tumours.</seg>
<seg id="2201">Data from an open clinical study suggest that there is a lower likelihood of response to the Imiquimod therapy in large tumours (&gt; 7.25 cm2).</seg>
<seg id="2202">Imiquimod was not studied for the treatment of actinic keratoses on eyelids, inside the nose or ears or on the lip area within the lip.</seg>
<seg id="2203">There are only very limited data on the application of Imiquimod for the treatment of actinic keratoses in anatomical parts outside the face and scalp.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The available data on the actinic keratose on the forearms and hands do not support the effectiveness of this application, therefore such an application is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Local skin reactions occur frequently, but these reactions usually decrease in intensity during therapy or go back after replacing the therapy with Imiquimod-cream.</seg>
<seg id="2206">If the local skin reactions cause severe discomfort to the patient or are very strong, the treatment may be exposed for a few days.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Data from an open clinical study showed that patients with more than 8 active lesions showed a lower full cure rate than patients with less than 8 lesions.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Due to immuno-stimulating properties, imiquimod cream should be used with caution in patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment (see 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2209">Animal studies show no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2210">Although neither after-recurring topical application quantifiable serum levels (&gt; 5ng / ml) have been achieved, no recommendation can be given during breastfeeding.</seg>
<seg id="2211">The most common reported and possibly or possibly with the application of Imiquimod-cream in connection with side effects in studies with three times weekly treatment were local reactions at the site of the treatment of hands (33.7% of patients treated with imiquimod).</seg>
<seg id="2212">The most commonly reported and possibly or possibly with the application of the Imiquimod-cream in the related side effects include complaints at the application site with a frequency of 28.1%.</seg>
<seg id="2213">The results reported by 185 with Imiquimod-Creme treated patients from a placebo-controlled Phase III clinical study are shown below.</seg>
<seg id="2214">The most common adverse event, probably or possibly with the Imiquimod-cream application, was a response to the application site (22% of patients treated with Imiquimod).</seg>
<seg id="2215">The adverse events reported in placebo-controlled Phase III clinical trials with Imiquimod-cream treated patients with actinic keratose are listed below.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The clinical evidence estimated according to the test plan shows that in these placebo-controlled clinical trials with three times weekly treatment with imiquimod-cream common skin reactions including erythema (61%), erosion (30%), excoriation / leaves (23%) and oedema (14%) came (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2217">The clinical evidence estimated according to the test plan shows that in these studies with five times weekly treatment with Imiquimod-cream, severe erythema (31%), severe erosions (13%), and severe scarring and salting (19%) occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2218">In clinical trials investigating the application of Imiquimod for the treatment of acute keratosis, alopecia was determined with a frequency of 0.4% (5 / 1214) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The inadvertent one-time oral intake of 200 mg Imiquimod, which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags, may cause nausea, vomiting, headache, myalgia, and fever.</seg>
<seg id="2220">The clinically serious side effect, which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg, consisted in hypotonia, normalized after oral or intravenous fluids.</seg>
<seg id="2221">In a pharmacokinetical examination, increasing systemic levels of alpha interferons and other cytokines were detected after the topical application of Imiquimod.</seg>
<seg id="2222">In 3 pivotal phase 3 efficacy studies, it was shown that efficacy in a complete healing of the tendencies at an Imiquimod treatment over 16 weeks of placebo treatment is significantly superior.</seg>
<seg id="2223">In 60% of patients treated with Imiquimod, the Feignices were complete; this was the case with 20% of the patients who treated placebo (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2224">A complete healing could be achieved at 23% of 157 male patients treated with Imiquimod, compared to 5% of 161 treated with placebo treated male patients (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2225">The efficacy of Imiquimod with five-time application per week over 6 weeks has been studied in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="2226">The target tumors were histologically confirmed single primary superficial BCCs with a minimum size of 0.5 cm2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The data presented from an open, uncontrolled long-term study after four years showed that approximately 79.3% [95% CI (73.7%, 84.9%)] of all patients treated clinically and stayed for 48 months.</seg>
<seg id="2228">The effectiveness of Imiquimod with three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks, interrupted by a four week, treatment-free period, was examined in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Patients had clinically typical, visible, discrete, non-hypertrophic records within a contiguous 25 cm2 treatment area on the hairy scalp or in the face.</seg>
<seg id="2230">The one-year data from two combined observation studies show a recurrence rate of 27% (35 / 128 patients) for patients with clinical treatment after one or two treatment periods.</seg>
<seg id="2231">The approved indications external tendencies, actinic keratose and superficial basal cell carcinoma do not occur in paediatric patients and were therefore not investigated.</seg>
<seg id="2232">Aldara cream was studied in four randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled trials on children aged 2 to 15 with Molluscum contagiosum (Imiquimod n = 576, placebo n = 313).</seg>
<seg id="2233">The efficacy of imiquimod could not be shown in these studies in the dosages investigated (3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or more)</seg>
<seg id="2234">A minimal systemic intake of the 5% Imiquimod cream by the skin of 58 patients with actinic keratose was observed during the three times weekly application during 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">The highest drug concentrations in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and measured 0.1, 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face (12.5 mg, 1 disposable bags), on the scalp (25mg, 2 bags) and on the hands / arms (75 mg, 6 bags).</seg>
<seg id="2236">The calculated obvious half-life time was about 10 times higher than the 2-hour half-life after subcutaneous use in a previous study; this indicates an extended retention of the medicine in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">The data on systemic exposure showed that the resorption of Imiquimod was low after topical application on MC-diseased skin of patients at the age of 6 - 12 years and comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with actinic keratose or superficial basal cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2238">In a four-month study of dermal toxicity in rats, doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg of KG resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased milz-weight; a study carried out for the dermal application for four months resulted in no similar effects in the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2239">A two-year study of carcinogenicity in mice on three days a week did not induce tumours on the application.</seg>
<seg id="2240">The corresponding mechanism is not known, but since Imiquimod has only a low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mutagen, there is a risk for humans to be regarded as very low due to systemic exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The tumors occurred in the group of mice treated with the agent-free cream, earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low UVR.</seg>

<seg id="2271">Aldurazyme is used for enzyme replacement therapy in patients with confirmed diagnosis of a Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I; α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat non-neurological manifestations of the disease (the symptoms that are not related to brain or nerves).</seg>
<seg id="2272">This means that certain substances (glycosaminoglycans, gags) are not broken down and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them.</seg>
<seg id="2273">The following non-neurological symptoms of MPS I may occur: increased liver, stiff joints, complicating movements, decreased lung volume, heart disease and eye disease.</seg>
<seg id="2274">The treatment with Aldurazyme should be monitored by a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other hereditary metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2275">The administration of Aldurazyme should take place in a hospital or a hospital with resuscitation equipment, and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to administration to prevent an allergic reaction.</seg>

<seg id="2277">The study mainly investigates the safety of the drug, but it also measured its effectiveness (by examining its effect on reducing the GAG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under the age of five, Aldurazyme lowered the GAG concentrations in the urine by about 60%, and half of the children treated had a normal large liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of aldurazyme in patients aged over five years (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) include headache, nausea, abdominal pain, rash, arthropathy (joint pain), back pain, pain in the limbs (in hands and feet), heat feeling, fever and reactions at the infusion site.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very common side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure, reduced oxygen saturation (a measurement of lung function), tachycardia (accelerated heart rate), fever and chills.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to laronidase or any of the other components (anaphylactic reaction).</seg>
<seg id="2282">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will check every year all new information that may be known, and where necessary update this summary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The manufacturer of Aldurazyme will observe patients who receive aldurazyme with regard to the reactions to the infusion and the development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission granted approval to the company Genzyme Europe B.V. for the marketing of Aldurazyme in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of human α -L-iduronidase and is produced using recombinant DNA technology using CHO mammal cell cultures (Chinese hamster Ovary, ovary of the Chinese hamster).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indicated for long-term enzyme replacement therapy in patients with confirmed diagnosis of a Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) in order to treat non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">The treatment with Aldurazyme should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other hereditary metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in adults over 65 years has not been determined, and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in patients with kidney or liver insufficiency was not determined, and no dosage intake can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with Aldurazyme may develop infusion-related reactions which are defined as any side effect occurring during infusion or until the end of the infusion day (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored and the infusion of Aldurazyme should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical environment in which revitalization facilities for medical emergencies are immediately available.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase 3 study, it is expected that nearly all patients form IgG antibodies against laronidase, usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of infusion-related reaction must be treated with caution when using Aldurazyme (see Sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Since there is little experience regarding the resumption of treatment after a longer break, it has to be cautiously avoided due to the theoretically elevated risk of hypersensitivity reaction after an interruption of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before starting the infusion with medication (antihistamines and / or antipyretics) to minimize the potential occurrence of infusion-related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of a slight or moderate infusion-related reaction, the treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen should be weighed and / or a reduction of the infusion rate to half the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In case of a single, severe infusion-related reaction, the infusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced, a treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen is to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2299">The infusion rate can be resumed with a reduction of the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 (antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen and / or corticosteroids) and a reduction of infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the preceding reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be applied simultaneously with chloroquine or procaine, because there is a potential risk of interference with the intracellular absorption of laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal experimental studies do not suggest direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since there are no data on newborns exposed to laronidase via breast milk, it is recommended not to breastfeed during the treatment with Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">Adverse events in clinical trials were predominantly treated as infusion-related reactions, which were observed in 53% of patients in the Phase 3 study (duration of up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study with participants under 5 years (treatment duration up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Adverse drug reactions in connection with Aldurazyme, observed during the phase 3 study and its extension in a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older with a treatment duration of up to 4 years, are listed in the following table according to the following frequency: very common (≥ 1 / 10); frequently (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-induced involvement of upper respiratory tract and lungs in prehistory, severe reactions occurred, including bronchospasm, respiratory failure and facial oedema (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children Undesirable Drug Interactions related to Aldurazyme, which were reported during a phase 2 trial with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years, with predominantly severe cross-term and treatment duration up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">Intravenous 100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">In most patients it occurred within 3 months from the beginning of the treatment to a seroconversion, with the patients aged under 5 years with a more severe form of decay (average after 26 days versus 45 days in patients aged 5 years and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Until the end of the phase 3 study (or until a premature exit from the study), no antibodies (RIP) assay were detected in 13 / 45 patients, including 3 patients with whom it never had been converted to seroconversion.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with a lack of low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the GAG mirror in the urine, while patients with high antibody titres had a variable decrease of GAG in urine.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in phase 3 study and one phase 2 study) showed a marginal until low neutralizing inhibiting effect on enzymatic laronidase activity in vitro which did not appear to affect the clinical effectiveness and / or the reduction of GAG in urine.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies did not seem to be associated with the incidence of adverse drug reactions, although the incidence of adverse drug reactions typically coincided with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The reason for the enzyme replacement therapy is one of the hydrolysis of the accumulated medium and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient enzyme activity.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After intravenous infusion, Laronidase is rapidly removed from circulation and absorbed by cells into the lysosomes, most likely about male-6-phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme were studied in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study of 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study, which showed the entire disease spectrum, the majority of patients were from the mean phenotype and only one patient showed the severe phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had a forced expiratory volume (FeV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for the efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FeV and the absolute walking distance in the 6-minute walk.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were subsequently recruited for an open-label extension study where they received 100 E / kg Aldurazyme for another 3,5 years (182 weeks) each week.</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy, the patients treated with Aldurazyme showed an improvement in lung function and mobility, which is shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">The open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group, as highlighted in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease in the expected percentage of FeV is clinically not significant over this period and the absolute pulmonary volumes increased in proportion to the children's body size.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with a Hepnuclear fisher before treatment 22 (85%) reached normal liver size until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks there was a clear decrease in the GAG mirror in the urine (µg / mg creatinine), which remained constant until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">With regard to the heterogeneous disease manifestation between patients, which was taken into account by using a combined repository, the clinically significant changes across five efficacy variables (anticipated percentage of normal FeV, distance in the 6-minute walk, range of movement of the shoulder joint AHI and visual acuity), was generally an improvement in 26 patients (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a deterioration in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A one-year open phase 2 study was conducted, primarily for the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme in 20 patients who were under 5 years old at the time of their inclusion in the study (16 patients with severe form and 4 with mean arterial form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to increased Gag- Mirrors in the urine in week 22.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a size growth (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) were determined according to the Z-Score for this age group The younger patients with the severe cross-course (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with the mean progression-form showed normal mental development speed, whereas in older patients with severe cross-course only limited or no advances in cognitive development were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study, studies on the pharmacodynamic effects of various Aldurazyme dosing schemes were performed on the GAG mirror in the urine, the liver volume and the 6-minute salvage test.</seg>

<seg id="2354">Alimta is used together with Cisplatin (another medicine for cancer) in patients who have not received chemotherapy (drugs against cancer) and "maligne" (malignant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body) or is likely to spread easily to other parts of the body. • advanced or metastatic "non-small" lung cancer that does not affect the plate epithelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Alimta is used as sole therapy for patients who have not previously been treated in combination with cisplatin and in patients who have previously received other chemotherapies.</seg>
<seg id="2356">To reduce side effects, the patients should receive a corticosteroid as well as folate (a vitamin) and injections of vitamin B12 during treatment with Alimta.</seg>
<seg id="2357">If Alimta is administered together with cisplatin, a "anti-medicine" (medicine against vomiting) and liquids (to prevent a lack of fluids) should be given before or after the addition of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In patients whose blood image changes or where certain other side effects occur, the treatment should be postponed, stopped or the dose is reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2359">The active form of telemetremixed thus slows the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from dividing.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The transformation of telemetremixed into its active form goes more easily in cancer cells than in healthy cells, leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the medicine and a longer period of time in cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Alimta was examined in a major study of 456 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for their disease.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, the effects of Alimta were compared in a study to 571 patients with advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy, with the effects of docetaxel (another medicine against cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">Alimta was also compared with gemcitabine (another drug against cancer), both in combination with Cisplatin in a study of 1 725 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2364">Patients who were treated with Alimta and Cisplatin lived an average of 12.1 months, compared to 9,3 months in the sole administration of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2365">In patients who had previously received chemotherapy, the average survival time with Alimta was 8.3 months compared to 7.9 months in docetaxel.</seg>
<seg id="2366">In both studies, however, patients with cancer did not attack the squamous cell cells during administration of Alimta rather than with the comparison medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2367">In September 2004, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Eli Lilly Nederland B.V. for the marketing of Alimta in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Each water bottle must be dissolved with 4.2 ml 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml), which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2369">The corresponding volume of the necessary dosage is taken from the bottle and diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride solution (9 mg / ml) to 100 ml (see section 6.6).</seg>
<seg id="2370">ALIMTA is shown in combination with cisplatin for first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell carcinoma (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2371">ALIMTA in monotherapy is indicated for the treatment in second-line treatment of patients with cross-cell treatment of advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2372">The recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² body surface area (KOF) is administered as an intravenous infusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The recommended dose of cisplatin is 75 mg / m ² KOF as an infusion over a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of the telemetrexed- infusion on the first day of every 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2374">In patients with non-small cell carcinoma after previous chemotherapy, the recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² KOF is administered as intravenous infusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2375">In order to reduce the frequency and severity of skin reactions, a corticosteroid should be given on the day before and on the day of the telemetry application as well as on the day after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2376">During the seven days before the first dose of telemetremixed, at least 5 doses of folic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued throughout the therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last Pemetrexed- dose.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Patients must also receive an intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 mcg) in the week before the first telemetremixed dose and after every third treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2378">In patients receiving telemetremixed, a complete blood pattern should be created before each administration, including a differentiation of leukocytes and thrombocyte counting.</seg>
<seg id="2379">Alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate transaminase (AST or SGOT) and Alanine transaminase (ALT or SGPT) should be ≤ 3 times higher than the upper limit value.</seg>
<seg id="2380">At the beginning of a new treatment cycle, a dose check must take place taking into consideration the nadir of the blood image or the maximum non-haematological toxicity of the preceding treatment cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2381">After recovery, patients must be treated according to the indications in the tables 1, 2 and 3 which are applicable for ALIMTA as monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC Grad 2 bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2383">Should patients develop non-haematological toxicity ≥ degrees 3 (except neurotoxicity), the treatment with ALIMTA must be interrupted until the patient receives the value before treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">Treatment with ALIMTA must be aborted if a hematological toxicity or non-haematological toxicity degree 3 or 4 occurs or so- continued in the occurrence of Grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical studies have no indication that in patients at the age of 65 years or over the age of 65, there is an increased side effect risk.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical trials patients with a creatinin-clearing of ≥ 45 ml / min were not necessary dosages which go beyond the dose adjustments recommended for all patients.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data layer in patients with a creatinin-clearing of less than 45 ml / min was insufficient; therefore, the application is not recommended (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with a function restriction of &gt; 1.5 times the upper Bilirubin limit value and / or transaminase values of &gt; the 3.0-fold the upper limit value (in the presence of liver metastases) were not studied especially in studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients need to be monitored with respect to bone markerage and can not be administered to patients before their absolute neutrophil number has again reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thrombo- cyte count again a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">A dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of absolute neutrophils, thrombocyte count and maximum non-haematological toxicity, as observed in the previous cycles of treatment (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction of grade 3 / 4 haematological and nithatological toxicity such as neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with grade 3 / 4 neutropenia was obsolete if a pretreatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients treated with telemetry must be instructed to use folic acid and vitamin B12 as a prophylactic measure for reduction of treatment-induced toxicity (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to medium renal insufficiency (creatinin clearances 45 to 79 ml / min) must avoid simultaneous intake of nonsteroidal anti-phlogistika (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and acetylsali- cyllic acid (&gt; 1.3 g daily) for at least 2 days before therapy, 2 days after therapy using telemetremixed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients, for whom therapy is provided with telemetremixed, must avoid taking NSAIDs with long half-life for at least 5 days before therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy using telemetremixed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients with these events had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of renal events, including dehydration, pre-existing high blood pressure or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Therefore, in patients with clinically significant fluid accumulation in the transcellular space a drainage of the effusion is to be considered before the telemetry treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 main cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials with telemetremixed when this substance was usually given in combination with another cytotoxic substance.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason the simultaneous application of attenuated live vaccine (except yellow fever, this vaccine is contraindicated) is not recommended (see section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">Since the possibility of an irreversible reduction of the reproductive ability by means of telemetremixed, men should be advised before the treatment course in order to obtain advice regarding the sperm conserving.</seg>
<seg id="2401">In patients with normal kidney function (creatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min), high doses of nonsteroidal anti-phlogistics (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylic acid can lead to a reduced amount of telemetry with the result of increased occurrence of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Caution must therefore be taken if patients with normal kidney function (creatinin clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) can be used in high doses of NSAIDs or acetylsalicylic acid in high doses.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen) or acetylsalicylic acid can be avoided at a high dosage for at least 2 days before therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy using telemetremixed (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since there are no data regarding the interaction potential with NSAIDs with long half-life such as Piroxxicam or Rofecoxib, the simultaneous application with telemetry must be avoided for at least 5 days prior to therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with telemetre- mixed.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The large intra-individual variability of the coagulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anticoagulants and antineoplastic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of INR (International Regular Ratio) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anticoagulants.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data for the use of telemetremixed in pregnant women, but as for ande- re-timetabolites severe birth defects are expected in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Telemetric-mixed must not be used during pregnancy except if necessary - demanding and after careful weighing of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the fetus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2408">Since the possibility of irreversible damage to the reproductive ability is made by telemetremixed, men should be advised prior to the commencement of treatment to obtain advice regarding the sperm conserving.</seg>
<seg id="2409">It is not known whether the breast milk passes into the breast milk and unwanted effects on the breastfed baby cannot be excluded.</seg>

<seg id="2431">ALIMTA (Pemetremixed) is an antineoplastic antifolate that exerts its effect by interrupting important metabolic processes necessary for cell replication.</seg>
<seg id="2432">In vitro studies showed that telemetremixed acts as antifolate with multiple targets by blocking the thymidylatsynthase (TS), Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and Glycinamidribonucleotid for- myltransferase (GARFT), which are the folate-dependent key enzymes of the de novo Biosynthesis of thymidin- and purinnucleotides.</seg>

<seg id="2513">Alli is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight (Body-Mass Index BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypokalic, fat-reduced diet.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Alli should not be used by children and adolescents under 18 because there is insufficient data on efficacy and safety.</seg>
<seg id="2515">However, since orlistat is only minimally absorbed, no adjustment of the dosage is necessary for elderly people and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="2516">• hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or any other ingredients • Simultaneous treatment with Ciclosporin (see section 4.5) • Breastfeeding (see section 4.6) • Breastfeeding (see section 4.6) • Simultaneous treatment with warfarin or other oral anticoagulants (see Sections 4.5 and 4.8)</seg>
<seg id="2517">The probability of occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms (see section 4.8) can increase if alli is taken together with a fat-rich individual meal or fat-rich diet.</seg>
<seg id="2518">As weight reduction in diabetes can be associated with improved metabolic control, patients who use a medicine for diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmacist before starting a treatment with alli because the dosage of the antidiabetic should be adjusted if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Patients who take alli as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should consult their doctor or pharmacist if the dosage of these drugs needs to be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2520">It is recommended to take additional pregnancy prevention measures in order to prevent the possible failure of oral contraception in case of severe diarrhoea (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2521">A reduction of the Ciclosporin plasma levels was observed in a study on interactions of medicines as well as in several cases with simultaneous use of orlistat and Ciclosporin.</seg>
<seg id="2522">When applying warfarin or other oral anticoagulants in combination with orlistat, the Quick values (internationally normalised ratio, INR) could be affected (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2523">In most patients treated with orlistat in clinical trials up to 4 full years, the levels of vitamins A, D, E and K and beta carotins remained in the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2524">However, patients should be advised to take supplementary multivitamin supplement before bedtime to ensure adequate vitamin absorption (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2525">After the addition of a single dose of Amiodarone, a marginal decrease in Amiodarone plasma concentration was observed with a limited number of healthy volunteers who received orlistat at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="2526">Animal experimental studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal nature and are associated with the pharmacological effect of the drug, as the absorption of biased fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">Gastrointestinal side effects were determined from clinical trials with orlistat 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The abundances are defined as follows: very often (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100), rarely (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1000) and very rare (&lt; 1 / 10,000), not known (frequency based on available data is not invaluable).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The incidence of known side-effects found after the launch of orlistat has not been known, as these events were voluntarily reported by a population of lesser magnitude.</seg>
<seg id="2531">† It is plausible that the treatment with alli can lead to anxiety regarding possible or actual gastrointestinal side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Single doses of 800 mg orlistat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days in normal and obese subjects without significant clinical findings.</seg>
<seg id="2533">In the majority of cases reported after the launch of orlistat overdose, either side effects or similar side effects were reported as for the recommended dose of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on human and animal studies, rapid regression of any systemic effects attributed to the livery inhibiting properties of orlistat can be assumed.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The therapeutic effect begins in the lumen of the stomach and the upper small intestine by covalent bonding to the active serine rest of the gastric and pankreatic lipases.</seg>
<seg id="2536">From clinical studies it was derived that 60 mg orlistat was taken three times a day, the absorption of about 25% of the dietary fat was blocked.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Two double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled studies in adults with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 prove the effectiveness of 60 mg orlistat, taken three times a day in combination with a hypokalic, fat-reduced diet.</seg>
<seg id="2538">The primary parameter, the change in body weight compared to the initial value (at the time of randomization), was evaluated as follows: as a change in body weight in the course of study (Table 1) and as a percentage of those study participants who have lost more than 5% or more than 10% of their initial weight (Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2539">Although weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies, the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The average dietary change in the Gesamtcholesterin was 60 mg -2.4% (initial value 5.20 mmol / l) and with placebo + 2.8% (initial value 5.26 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2541">The average change in LDL cholesterol was 60 mg -3.5% with orlistat (baseline 3.3 mmol / l) and placebo + 3.8% (initial value 3.41 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2542">At the waist circumference, the average change was -4.5 cm with orlistat 60 mg (initial value 103.7 cm) and with placebo -3.6 cm (initial value 103.5 cm).</seg>
<seg id="2543">Plasma concentrations of non-metabolized orlistat were not measurable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg orlistat (&lt; 5 ng / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2544">7 In general, non-metabolized orlistat in plasma could only be detected sporadically and in extremely low concentrations (&lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.02 µmol) and without signs of an accumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2545">In a study with obese patients the minimal systemic resorbiased dose was administered, two main metabolites, namely M1 (in position 4 hydrolysed Lactonring) and M3 (M1 according to the cleavage of the N-formyl-leucine group), were identified, which represented approximately 42% of the total plasma concentration.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Aloxi is used in chemotherapies, which cause nausea and vomiting (such as cisplatin), as well as in chemotherapies, the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting (such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin or carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The effectiveness of Aloxi can be increased by adding a corticosteroids (a drug that can be used as an anti-method).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The use in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended as there is not enough information about the effects in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the substance inhibits the binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin), to the receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">In three main studies, Aloxi was studied at 1 842 adults who received chemotherapy, which are strong or moderate for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In chemotherapies, the severe trigger for nausea and vomiting, 59% of patients treated with Aloxi had no vomiting in 24 hours after chemotherapy (132 of 223), compared to 57% of patients treated with ondansetron (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In chemotherapies, the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting showed 81% of patients treated with Aloxi, in the 24 hours after chemotherapy not vomiting (153 of 189), compared to 69% of patients treated with ondansetron (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In comparison with Dolasetron these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 of 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission granted approval for the marketing of Aloxi in the entire European Union to the company Helsinki Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indicated: to prevent acute nausea and vomiting for highly emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer and to prevent nausea and vomiting in moderately emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The efficacy of Aloxi for the prevention of nausea and vomiting, which is induced by a strong emetogenic chemotherapy can be enhanced by adding a corticosteroids given prior to chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since palonosetron can prolong the colon, patients with anamnesty obstipation or signs of a subacute Ileus after injection should be closely monitored.</seg>
<seg id="2620">However, as with other 5HT3 antagonists, caution is required with simultaneous administration of Palonosetron with medicines that extend the QT interval or in patients with the QT interval or tend to such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">Besides chemotherapy, Aloxi is not intended to be used for prevention or treatment of nausea and vomiting in the days following chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies, Palonosetron did not inhibit the activity of the five chemotherapeutic agents examined against tumours (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cytarabin, doxorubicin and mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">A clinical trial showed no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a single dose of intravenous Palonosetron and a Steady State- Concentration of oral metoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a pharmacokinetic analysis based on a population, it was shown that the simultaneous administration of CYP2D6 inductors (amodarone, celecoxib, chlorpromazin, cimetidine, doxorubicin, fluoxetine, rexorubicin, oxetine, rexorubicin, oxetine, sertraline and terbinafine) had no significant effect on the clearing of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experience in the use of palonosetron in human pregnancies is not present, so Palonosetron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the treating physician.</seg>
<seg id="2626">Clinical trials were the most common side effects of 250 mcg. of observed adverse events (a total of 633 patients), possibly associated with Aloxi, headache (9%) and obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitivity reactions and reactions at the site (burning, hardening, discomfort and pain) were reported in post-marketing reports.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage similar frequencies of adverse events as in the other dosing groups showed; there were no dose-action-relationships to observe.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Dialysis studies have not been performed, but due to the large distribution volume a dialysis is probably not an effective therapy with an Aloxi- overdose.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies, a total of 1,132 patients who received moderately emetogenic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 Cisplatin, carboplatin, ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide (half-life time: 7.3 hours) were given that given day 1 without dexamethasone intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomised double-blind study, a total of 667 patients who received a strong emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazin and 250 or 750 mcg. of Palonosetron were compared with patients who received 32 mg of ondansetron which were given intravenously on day 1.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of studies with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy and the study of highly emetogenic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials of indication chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), palonosetron effects were comparable to blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters including the Qtc interval with the corresponding effects of ondansetron and dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">After clinical investigations, Palonosetron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in ventricular de- and replicarisation and extend the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study carried out in 221 healthy volunteers was the assessment of the ECG effects of intravenous palonosetron in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">After IV administration, an initial decrease in plasma concentrations follows a slow elimination of the body with an average terminal half-life of approximately 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and the area below the concentration time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally dose-related in whole dose range of 0,3- 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">Following intravenous palonosetron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the mean (± SD) increase of the palonosetron plasma concentration measured at 42 ± 34% was observed between day 1 and day 5.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Pharmacokinetic simulations suggest that at once daily intravenous dose of 0.25 mg palonosetron was comparable to a value measured after a one-off intravenous dose of 0.75 mg; however, the Cmax was higher after the exposure of 0.75 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2640">Approximately 40% are eliminated by the kidneys and approximately 50% are converted into two primary metabolites, which compared to Palonosetron over less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In vitro studies on metabolism we have shown that CYP2D6 and, to a lesser extent, are involved in the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 on the metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination According to an intravenous dose of 10 mcg / kg [14C] -Palonosetron, about 80% of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine, Palonosetron as an unchanged ingredient made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a one-time intravenous injection of healthy dogs, the total corporal amounts for 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal clearing was 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Although patients with severe liver dysfunctions increase the terminal elimination stage and the average systemic exposure to Palonosetron, however, a reduction of the dose is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In preclinical studies, effects were observed only after expositions, which are considered to be sufficient above the maximum human therapeutic exposure, suggesting low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 out of preclinical studies evidence suggests that palonosetron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations, which are involved in ventricular de- and reolarisation and can prolong the duration of action.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of Palonosetron (each dose corresponded in approximately 30 times of therapeutic exposure to humans), which were given daily over two years, led to increased incidence of liver tumours, endocrine Neoplasms (in thyroid gland, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal mares) and skin tumours in rats, but not mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but due to the high dosages used and since Aloxi is intended for one-off application, the relevance of these results is low for humans.</seg>
<seg id="2649">The European Commission must inform the European Commission on the purpose of placing the drug approved as part of this decision.</seg>

<seg id="2660">In June 2006, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a negative report recommended by Alpheon 6 million IE / ml injection solution for the treatment of the medicines intended for the treatment of hepatitis C.</seg>
<seg id="2661">This means that Alpheon should resemble a biological medicinal product called Roferon-A with the same drug that is already approved in the EU (also called "reference medicines").</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis C (a liver disease called by a viral infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In a microscopic examination the liver tissue damages damage, and the values of the liver enzyme Alanine amotransferase (ALT) in the blood abnormally are increased.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast in which a gene (DNA) was introduced to stimulate the formation of the active substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The manufacturer of Alpheon presented data that demonstrate the comparison of alpheon with Roferon-A (drug structure, composition and purity of the medicine, mode of action, safety and efficacy in hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study of hepatitis C patients the efficacy of alpheon was compared with the efficacy of the reference drug to 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study measured how many patients responded to the medication after 12 of a total of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after treatment (i.e. no symptoms of the virus in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="2668">(44-20) 74 18 84 00 Fax (44-20) 74 18 84 16 E-mail: mail @ emea.eu.int http: / / www.emea.eu.int http: / / www.emea.eu.int © EMEA 2006 Reproduction and / or distribution of this document is Authorised for non commercial purposes only provided the EMEA is acknowledged. what were the biggest concerns given to the CHMP opinion to prohibit the marketing authorization?</seg>
<seg id="2669">In addition, concerns were reported that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed would not suffice.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of patients with hepatitis C, responding to the treatment with alpheon and roferon-A, was similar in the clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After the treatment with alpheon, the disease worsened again in more patients than with the reference drug product; Alpheon also had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from this, the test used in the study to investigate the question of how far the drug acts as an immune response (i.e. the body produces antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine) are not adequately validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used for the treatment of impetigo (skin infection accompanied by crust formation) and small infected infirmary (crack or cuts), abrasions and sewed wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used to treat infections that have been proven or probably caused by methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alarcon may not work against this type of infection.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be applied in patients from the age of nine months, but in patients under 18 years of age, the area to be treated must not exceed 2% of the body's surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced) and inhibits the growth of the bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was cleared after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients under placebo were responding to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected skin-related patients, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: about 90% of patients in both groups responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, it was found that Altargo is not effective enough in the treatment of abscesses (frozen cavities in the body tissue) or of infections that have been proven or probably caused by MRSA.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with altargo (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) is a irritation to the order.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the advantages of Altargo were outweighed by the short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections: • Impetigo, • infected small infirmities, abrasions or sewed wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission granted the company Glaxo Group Ltd. to approve the marketing of Altargo across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two to three days are to be examined and an alternative therapy should be considered (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the event of a sensitization or serious local irritation by the application of RetapaminoSalbe, the treatment should be stopped, the ointment carefully wiped out and an appropriate alternative treatment of the infection is started.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retinapamine should not be used to treat infections in which MRSA is known as pathogen or suspected (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical trials of secondary uninfected open wounds the efficacy of retinapamulin in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was insufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Alternative therapy should be considered if there is no improvement or deterioration of the infected position after a 2 to 3-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous use of retineculin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the low plasma concentrations, which were achieved in humans after topical use on abraded skin or infected surface wounds, clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not expected (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After simultaneous oral administration of 2 times a day 200 mg ketoconazol, the middle retapamine AUC (0-24) and Cmax according to topical application of 1% Retapamulin Salbe increased by 81% following topical application of healthy adult men.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients, dose adjustments are not considered necessary if topical retention is applied during systemic treatment with CYP3A4 Inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive toxicity after oral intake and are inadequate in relation to a statement regarding the birth and the fetal / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retinapamine ointment should only be used during pregnancy if a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of retinapaminoa is preferable to the administration of a systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">In deciding whether breastfeeding should be continued / terminated or continued therapy with Altargo, it is necessary to weigh between the benefit of breastfeeding for the baby and the benefit of the Altargo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical trials of 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, which Altargo have applied, the most commonly reported side effect was irritation at the site that affects approximately 1% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Mode of action Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pleuromutilin, a substance which is isolated by fermentation from clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly Purotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The mechanism of action of Retapamulin is based on selective inhibition of bacterial protein synthesis through interaction at a specific binding point of the 50 subunit of the bacterial ribosom, which differs from the binding sites of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicates that the binding site of ribosomal protein L3 is involved and is located in the region of the ribosomal P binding site and the Peptidyltransferase centre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By binding on this binding site, Pleuromutiline inhibits peptide transfer, block partial P-binding-interactions and prevent normal formation of active 50s ribosomal subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">If due to the local prevalence of resistance the application of Retapamulin appears to be questionable at least some types of infection, a consultation should be aspired by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">No differences were detected in in vitro activity of retinapaminoid versus S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolate were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of non-response to treatment with S.aureus, the presence of trunks with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a healthy adult study 1% retinapamine ointment was applied daily under occlusion to intact and reduced skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Of 516 patients (adults and children) who received 1% Retapamulin Salbe twice a day for treatment of secondary traumatic wounds for 5 days, individual plasma samples were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">The sampling was performed on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before medication and the children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic intake in humans after topical application of 1% ointment to 200 cm2 of abraded skin (Cmax = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) 660 times lower than the retinapaminer IC50 for PGP inhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The in vitro oxidative metabolism of retinapaminoids in human liver microsomes was primarily mediated by CYP3A4, with small participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies on oral toxicity of rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were carried out over 14 days, there were indications of adaptive liver and thyroid gland changes.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In vitro examination of gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse-lymphoma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in the rat-microkernel test for in-vivo study of chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There were neither male nor female rats symptoms of reduced fertility in oral dosages of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, whereby one to 5 times higher exposure was achieved than the highest estimated exposure in humans (topical application to 200 cm2 of abraded skin):</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxicity study on rats, oral doses of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (according to ≥ 3 times the estimated human exposure (see above), developmental toxicity (reduced body weight of the fetus and delayed oscillation) and maternal toxicity were determined.</seg>
<seg id="2714">The owner of the marketing authorization must ensure that a pharmaceutical vigilance system, as presented in module 1.8.1 of the Application Contract (version 6.2) is present and works before the product is marketed and as long as the marketed product is used.</seg>
<seg id="2715">The holder of the marketing authorization is obliged to carry out detailed studies and additional pharmaceutical vigilance activities in the Pharmacovigilance plan, as described in Version 1 of the Risk Management Plan (RMP), as well as all additional updates of RMP, which are agreed with the CHMP.</seg>
<seg id="2716">As described in the CHMP "Guideline on Risk Management Systems for Human Use," the updated RMP should be submitted simultaneously with the next Periodic Safety Update Report.</seg>
<seg id="2717">For irritation or other signs and symptoms at the treated spot, you should quit the application of Altargo and talk to your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2718">Do not apply any other ointments, creams or lotions on the surface treated with Altargo unless expressly prescribed by your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2719">It must not be used in the eyes, on the mouth or on the lips, in the nose or in the female genital area.</seg>
<seg id="2720">If the ointment is out of sight on one of these surfaces, wash the spot with water and ask your doctor for advice if discomfort occurs.</seg>
<seg id="2721">After applying the ointment you can cover the affected area with a sterile dressing or a gazing cover unless your doctor has advised you not to cover the surface.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children between one and 15 years, which are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is applied as part of a vaccination plan consisting of two doses, whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix can only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during the immunization and it is ensured that the vaccination plan existing from two doses can be completed.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a riser dose is desirable against hepatitis A or B, Ambirix or another hepatitis B or B vaccine can be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Combating vaccines by helping the immune system (the natural defences of the body), as it can defend itself against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">"" "after a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognizes the viruses and surface antigens as" "" "foreign" "" "and creates antibodies against it." ""</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same components as the vaccine Twinrix grown-up since 1996 and the vaccine Twinrix used since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect against the same diseases, but Twinrix adults and Twinrix children are administered as part of a three-dose vaccination plan.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix adults contain identical ingredients, some of the data, which support the application of Twinrix adults, were also used as evidence for the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration a month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study with 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six-month and a 12 month gap between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Between 98 and 100% of the vaccinated children Ambirix took a month after the last injection to develop protective antibody concentrations in hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambirix was similar to six months and a 12 month gap between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed with more than 1 out of 10 vaccine doses) are headache, lack of appetite, pain at the injection point, redness, matchiness (fatigue) as well as irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the active ingredients, any of the other ingredients or neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">In August 2002, the European Commission granted GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals a.s.a. a permit for the marketing of Ambirix in the whole</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standardization plan for primers vaccination with Ambirix is made up of two doses whereby the first dose is administered at the date of the election and the second dose between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a booster dose is desired both for hepatitis A and hepatitis B, vaccines or combination vaccines can be vaccinated with the appropriate monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) are based on the same size as after vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet fully secured whether immunocompetent persons who have responded to hepatitis C vaccination need a booster shot as a protection since they may also be protected by immunological memory for non-detectable antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all injection vaccines, appropriate means of medical treatment and monitoring should be immediately available for the rare case of anaphylactic reaction after the application of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a quick protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardization scheme is recommended with the combination vaccine containing 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated Hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In the case of hemodialysis patients and persons suffering from disorders of the immune system, there may be no adequate anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibody (anti-HAV- and anti-HBs) so that in these cases the administration of additional vaccines can be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Because an intra-dermal injection or intramuscular administration in the gluteal muscles could lead to a suboptimal result, these injection routes should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">However, in cases of thrombocytopenia or blood clotting disorders, Ambirix can be injected subcutanously as it can occur in these cases after intramuscular administration to bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2748">If Ambirix was administered in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection, tetanus, azelular pertussis-, inactivated poliomyelitis and Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (DTPA-IPV / HIB) or with a combined measern- mummy vaccine, the immune response to all antigens was sufficient (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients with immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immune defects it has to be assumed that an adequate immune response may not be achieved.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study carried out with 3 doses of this formulation in adults, the frequency of pain, redness, swelling, matchiness, gastroenteritis, headache and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in the earlier thiomint- and preservative-containing vaccine formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials, 2029 vaccinations were administered to a total of 1027 vaccines at the age of 1 to 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study of 300 participants aged 12 to 15 years, the compatibility of Ambirix was compared with that of the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2753">The only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and matedness on a basis for calculation per vaccination dose Ambirix, but not based on a calculation basis per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the administration of Ambirix in 50.7% of the subjects, compared with 39.1% in the subjects after the administration of a dose of the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2755">According to the complete vaccination cycle, 66.4% of the subjects who had given Ambirix reported pain, compared to 63.8% in the test persons who had been vaccinated with the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of matedness was comparable to each proband (i.e. over the entire vaccination cycle with 39.6% of the subjects who received Ambirix, compared with 36.2% in the test persons who received the 3-dose combination vaccine).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The incidence of severe pain and matchiness was low and comparable to the observed combination vaccine with the 3-dose vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study of 1 to 11 years, the incidence of local reactions and general reactions in the AmbirixGroup was comparable to that observed when administration with the 3-dose combination vaccine with a viral hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">In the 6- to 11-year-olds, however, after vaccination with Ambirix a more frequent occurrence of pain (at the injection point) per dose, not per proband, was reported.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The percentage of inoculations that reported severe side effects during the 2-dose vaccination scheme with Ambirix or during the 3-dose vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 ELISA- units of formalinininactivated Hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen was statistically not different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials conducted at the age of 1 to 15 years, Seroarthritis rates for anti-HAV 99.1% were 1 month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second dose, per month 6 administered dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The Seroarthritis rates for anti-HBs were 74.2% one month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second dose, per month 6 administered dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study conducted at 12- and including 15-year-olds, 142 two doses of Ambirix and 147 were awarded the standard combinationsimp with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In the 289 people whose immunogenicity was worthless, the seroprotection rates (SP in the table below) were significantly higher compared to hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after administration of the 3-dose vaccination significantly higher than with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immunological answers reached in a clinical comparative study at 1 to 11-year-olds after the completion of the full vaccination series (i.e. in month 7) are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies, the vaccines received either a 2-dose vaccination scheme with Ambirix or a 3-dose vaccination scheme with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated Hepatitis A virus and 10µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">The persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies could be detected for at least 24 months after immunization with Ambirix in the 0-6-month vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immune reaction observed in this study was similar to that observed after vaccination of 3 doses combined with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated Hepatite A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study at 12- to including 15-year-olds, it could be shown that the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies can be compared 24 months after immunization in the 0-6 months vaccination scheme compared to the 0-12 months vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose of Ambirix in the second year of life was administered simultaneously with the refresh chime of a combined diphtheria, tetanus, azelular pertussis-, inactivated poliomyelitis and 8 Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (DTPA-IPV / HIB) or with the first dose of a combined measles mummy vaccine, the immune response to all antigens was sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study conducted with 3 doses of current formulation for adults showed similar seroprotection and seroarthritis rates similar to previous formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The vaccine is examined both before and after resuspening to any foreign particles and / or physical visible changes.</seg>

<seg id="2778">You may feel very tired, have a dark urine, pale face, yellow skin and / or eyes (jaundice) and other symptoms that may make hospitalisation necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2779">As with all vaccines, Ambirix is not able to fully protect against infection with hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus, even if the complete vaccination series has been completed with 2 doses.</seg>
<seg id="2780">If you / your child are already infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus prior to the administration of both vaccines Ambirix / is (although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or feel sick at the moment of vaccination) an inoculation may not prevent a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2781">Protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those of hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection cannot be mediated.</seg>
<seg id="2782">• If you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ambirix or any part of this vaccine, including Neomycin (an antibiotic), if you have an allergic reaction to Ambirix or any part of this vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2783">An allergic reaction can manifest through itchy skin rashes, shortness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue. • If you have an allergic reaction to a previous vaccination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B, if you have a severe infection with fever.</seg>
<seg id="2784">• If you want to have a quick protection against hepatitis B (i.e. within 6 months and before the scheduled administration of the second inoculation).</seg>
<seg id="2785">At a potential risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination, the physician will advise you / your child from a vaccination with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, he will recommend 3 injections of a combined hepatitis B / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective HCV (360 ELISA units of a formalininactivated Hepatitis A virus and 10 micrograms of a recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second inoculation of this vaccine with reduced content of effective components is usually given a month after the first dose and is likely to give you a vaccination protection before the end of the vaccination series.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes Ambirix is injected in persons suffering from severe blood clots, under the skin and not injected into the muscle. • If you / your child are weakened due to illness or treatment in your / her body's defense / or if you / your child undergo a hematalysis / subtract.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambirix can be given in these cases, but the immune response of these individuals to the vaccination can not be sufficient so that a blood test can be required to see how strongly the reaction is to the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2790">21 Tell your doctor if you / your child take other medicines / takes (including those you can get without prescription) or if you / your child has been vaccinated / / or has been planned or planned in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2791">However, it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine has to be given simultaneously with Ambirix, it should be vaccinated in separate areas and as different extremities as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If Ambirix is to be given at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immunoglobulins, it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will nonetheless be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2794">Normally, Ambirix will not be given pregnant or breastfeeding women, unless it is urgent that they are vaccinated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B.</seg>
<seg id="2795">Important information about certain other components of Ambirix Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to Neomycin (antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2796">If you miss the agreed date for the second vaccination, talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2797">♦ very common (more than 1 case per 10 missed doses): • pain or discomfort on the spot or redness • Mateness • irritability • headache • lack of appetite</seg>
<seg id="2798">♦ common (up to 1 case per 10 diluted cans): • swelling at the injection point • fever (above 38 ° C) • Feeling dizziness • Gastro-intestinal discomfort</seg>
<seg id="2799">Other side effects reported days or weeks following vaccination with comparable combination or individual vaccines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B (less than 1 case per 10,000 inoculated doses) are:</seg>

<seg id="2804">Ambirix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without needles and in packs of 50 without needles.</seg>
<seg id="2805">On the basis of data known since obtaining the first approval for placing on the market, the CHMP advocated that the benefit-risk relationship for Ambirix remains positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">However, since Ambirix was brought into circulation only in a Member State (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this medicine is limited due to the low patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammony can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with incomplete enzyme defect or hyperammonia encephalopathy (brain damage due to high ammonia concentrations) in prehistory.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonschnaps is divided into several individual doses at meals - swallowed, mixed with food or administered via a gastropostomer tube (through the abdominal wall into the stomach's leading tube) or a nasal probe (through the nose into the stomach of leading tube).</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was not a comparative study since Ammony could not be compared with another treatment or placebo (a pseudo medicine, i.e. without active substance).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammony can also result in loss of appetite, a abnormal acid content in the blood, depression, irritability, headache, fainting, fluid retention, taste disturbances or taste sap, abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, skin rash, unpleasant body odor or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that Ammony effectively prevented ammonia levels in patients with urine flow disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2812">Ammony was approved under "exceptional circumstances" because only limited information on this drug was available due to the condition of the disease at the time of admission.</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indicated in all patients with a complete enzyme shortage already manifested in newborns (within the first 28 days of life).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late manifle form (incomplete enzyme defect that manifests itself after the first month of life) there is an indication for the use when hypermetropic encephalopathy is present in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with difficulty swallowing, AMMONAPS is also available in granular form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is calculated individually taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake of the patient needed for growth and development.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrate is: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">The substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early deficiency of Carbambinphosphate synthetase or orniethintranscarpathia.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with argininosuccinatsynthetase deficiency have to receive arginine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be given to patients with difficulty swallowing, as there is a risk for the formation of oesophagulcera if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, respectively 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">Therefore, AMMONAPS should only be used with caution in patients with congestive heart failure or severe renal insufficiency as well as with sodium retention and odema formation.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Since metabolism and excretion of sodium phenylbutyrate takes place over the liver and kidneys, AMMONAPS should only be used with extreme care in patients with liver or renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">In the subcutaneous injection of phenylacetate to young rats in high doses (190 - 474 mg / kg), there was a slowdown of the neural proliferation and increased loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">There was also a delayed maturation of cerebral synapses and reduced number of functioning nerve endings in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be determined whether phenylacetate is excreted in humans into breast milk, and for this reason the use of AMMONAPS is contraindicated during the lactation period (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS at least 56% of patients had at least an undesirable event (AE) and 78% of these adverse events were assumed that they were not associated with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very often (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an eighteen-year-old anorectic patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in connection with lactate dosis, severe hypokalemia, bulbar topenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of overdosing occurred in a 5-month-old infant with an accidental single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms begin with the accumulation of phenylacetate, which showed a dose-limiting neurotoxicity in intravenous doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolic active compound, conjugated by acetylation with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine, which is excreted via the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for excretion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disorders of the urea cycle can be assumed that for each gram of a sodium phenylate between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine can be produced.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that diagnosis is early and the treatment is started immediately in order to improve survival and clinical outcome.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the occurrence of early symptoms in newborns was almost always infaust, and the disease even led to death in treatment with peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen-free analoga within the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">Due to hematalysis, the use of alternative methods of nitrogen separation (sodium phenylbutyrate, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate), protein-reduced diet and possibly substitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate newborn at postpartal (but within the first life month) to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">Patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and who were already treated before the first appearance of hyperammonia encephalopathy was 100% survival, but even with these patients it was time with many mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Patients with a late-manifest form of the disease (including female patients with the heterozygous form of the OrnithinTranscarpathian deficiency), which recovered from hypermetropic encephalopathy and treated lastingly with sodium phenylbutyrate and a protein-reduced diet, was 98% survival.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible in the treatment and a further deterioration of neurological condition can occur in some patients.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrate is oxidized to phenylacetate, which is conjugated by glutamine in the liver and kidneys, with phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrate and its metabolites in plasma and urine were determined after a single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in sober healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, hemoglobin metabolism and with repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day (uncontrolled trials).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behavior of phenylbutyrate and its metabolites was also studied in cancer patients after IV administration of sodium phenylbutyrate (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral individual dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in tablet form 15 minutes after taking measured plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrate were determined.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with urea-cycline disorders or hemoglobin opathies, phenylbutyrat (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) could not be detected the next morning after nocturnal fasting.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three out of six patients with liver cirrhosis that were repeatedly treated with sodium phenylbutyrate (20 g / day oral in three single doses), the mean phenylacetate concentrations were five times higher on the third day than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Excretion The medication is excreted within 24 hours to about 80-100% in the form of the conjugated product Phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2849">Following the results of the Micronucleus test, sodium-phenylbutyrate had no obvious effects with toxic and non-toxic cans (examination 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS granulate is given either orally (infants and children who can not swallow pills or patients with swallowing disorders) or via a gastropostomia or a nasal probe.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrate is: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with newborns, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched chain amino acids), carnitine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">The substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early deficiency of Carbambinphosphate synthetase or orniethintranscarpathia.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS granulate contains 124 mg (5.4 mmol) sodium per gram of sodium polybutyrate, respectively 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">If rat-flutes were exposed before the birth phenylacetate (active metabolism of phenylbutyrate), there were lesions in the pyramidal cells of the cortex.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an eighteen-year-old anorectic patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in connection with lactate dosis, severe hypokalemia, bulbar topenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for excretion of excess.</seg>
<seg id="2858">On the basis of tests on the excretion of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, it can be assumed that for each gram of a sodium phenylate between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine can be produced.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible in treatment, and in some patients a further deterioration of neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After an oral individual dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in granular form 15 minutes after taking measured plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrate were determined.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During the period of durability the patient can store the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not exceeding 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">With this procedure, the small measuring spoon contains 0.95 g, the mean measuring spoon 2,9 g and the large measuring spoon 8,6 g sodium phenylbutyrate.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient has to receive the medicine via a probe, AMMONAPS can also be dissolved in water before use (the solubility of sodium phenylbutyrate amounts to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases certain liver enzymes are missing so that they cannot excrete the nitrogenous waste products that accumulate in the body after eating proteins.</seg>
<seg id="2865">If laboratory tests are carried out with you, you need to tell the doctor that you are taking AMMONAPS since sodium phenylbutyrate may affect the results of certain laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2866">When taking AMMONAPS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2867">During breastfeeding, you should not take AMMONAPS since the medicine could pass into the breast milk and harm your baby.</seg>
<seg id="2868">In rare cases, confusion, headache, taste disturbances, slowing of the ear, disorientation, memory problems and the deterioration of existing neurological conditions have also been observed.</seg>
<seg id="2869">If you notice one of these symptoms, contact your doctor immediately or with the emergency room of your hospital for initiation of a corresponding treatment.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is used for the treatment of adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS, reduced blood supply to the heart), for example in case of unstable angina (a form of pain in the chest with different strength) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) without "stress uplift" (an anomalous measured value in the electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients undergoing a PCI, a higher dose is administered and the infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help in patients with angina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Approximately 14 000 patients participated in the primary study of the treatment of ACS, in which the effect of angiox was compared with a chemotherapy-IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, another drug to prevent blood clots) with the conventional combination treatment with heparin (another anticoagulant) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI a stent (a short tube that remains in the artery to prevent a closure) was used, and they also received other medicines to prevent blood clots such as Abciximab und Aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS, Angiox - with or without the use of GPI - was as effective in the prevention of new events (deaths, heart attacks or reascularization) after 30 days or a year overall as effectively as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients who underwent a PCI, Angiox was as effective as Heparin with respect to all indicators, except for severe bleeding, in which it was much more effective than heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox may not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to Bivalirudine, other hirudine or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It must also not be used in patients who recently had bleeding, as well as people with severe hypertension or severe kidney problems or a heart infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that Angiox is an acceptable substitute for Heparin during the treatment of ACS and during one PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission granted approval for the marketing application of Angiox across the European Union to the company The Medicines Company UK Ltd.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina / non-invasive surge infarction (IA / NSTEMI)) in case of emergency intervention or early intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initial dose of Angiox in patients with ACS is an intravenous mean of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If the patient is already one PCI, an additional bolus of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the infusion for the duration of the surgery can be increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">According to clinical requirements, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be resumed for 4 to 12 hours after the PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2894">A bolus yield of 0.5 mg / kg is to be administered immediately before the procedure, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of Angiox in patients with one PCI consists of an initial intravenous infusion of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and an immediate subsequent intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of a single bolus administration from Angiox was not investigated and is not recommended even if a short PCI operation is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened to under 225 seconds, a second bolus yield of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should take place.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values, the reconstituted and diluted medication should be carefully mixed before the application and the studdose can be administered intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">As soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds, further monitoring is no longer required, provided that the 1.75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate kidney function restriction (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which are undergone one PCI (whether treated with Bivalirudin against ACS or not), a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT-value is less than 225 seconds, a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dose should be checked again.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate kidney damage, included in the III- PCI study (REPLACE-2), which led to approval, the ACT score was 5 minutes after administration of the Bivalirudin Bolus without dosage adjustment at an average of 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3) Angiox is contraindicated in patients with severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and dialysis patients (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">Treatment with Angiox can be initiated 30 minutes after the intravenous administration of unquestioning heparin or 8 hours after finishing the subcutaneous administration of low molecular heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2905">• known hypersensitivity to the active substance or any other component or against hirudine • active bleeding or increased risk of bleeding caused by a disturbance of haemostasis and / or irreversible clotting disorders. • severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and dialysis patients</seg>
<seg id="2906">Patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding, especially if Bivalirudin is administered in combination with another anticoagulant (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even if the most hemorrhages occur under Bivalirudin on arterial points of puncture, patients who undergo a percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) can occur while the treatment in principle occur everywhere bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients who are taking Warfarin and treated with Bivalirudin, monitoring of the INR value (International Regulated Ratio) should be considered to ensure that the value after completion of the treatment with Bivalirudin is again achieved prior to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">From the knowledge of the mechanism of action of anticoagulants (Heparin, warfarin, thrombolytics or thrombocyte aggregations), it can be assumed that these active substances increase the risk of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In the combination of bivaliruines with thrombocyte aggregations or anticoagulants, the clinical and biological hemostasis parameters are regularly monitored.</seg>
<seg id="2911">The animal experiments are insufficient in relation to the effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, the birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2912">4612 were randomised to Bivalirudine alone, 4604 were randomised to Bivalirudine plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor and 4603 were randomized to either unquestionable heparin or Enoxaparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2913">In both the Bivalirudine group and in the comparison groups treated with Heparin it occurred in women as well as in patients over 65 years more common to adverse events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Severe hemorrhages were defined in accordance with ACUITY and Timi scales for severe bleeding like in the footnotes of table 2.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both light and severe bleeding performed significantly less frequently under Bivalirudine than in groups with haparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor and Bivaliddin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">An ACUITY heavy bleeding was defined as one of the following events: intracranial, retroperitoneal, intraocular bleeding or hemorrhage in the puncture area, which required radiological or surgical intervention, hematoma with a diameter ≥ 5 cm at the point of puncture, reduction of haemoglobin mirror ≥ 5 g / dl with known bleeding location, reoperation due to bleeding, application of blood products for transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Further, less frequently observed hemorrhages, which occurred at more than 0.1% (occasionally), were "other" puncture points, retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, ear, nose or throat.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following information about adverse events is based on data from a clinical trial with Bivalirudin in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2919">In both the Bivalirudine group and in the comparison groups treated with Heparin, more common adverse events occurred in women and patients over 65 years of age than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both light and severe hemorrhages were significantly less common than in the comparison group under Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The following side effects, which are not listed above, were reported according to comprehensive application in practice and are grouped into table 6 according to system organ classes.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In case of overdosing, the treatment with Bivalirudin is immediately broken off and the patient is closely meshed to monitor the signs of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains Bivalirudine, a direct and specific thrombinding inhibitor that binds both at the catalytic centre and the anion-binding region of Thrombin, regardless of whether Thrombine is present in the liquid phase or clots.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The binding of Bivalirudin to Thrombin, and therefore its effect, is reversible, because Thrombin slowly splits the bonds of Bivalirudin-ARG3-Pro4, which regenerates the function of the active center of thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, Bivalirudin with serum of patients, where in the past had come to heparin@-@ induced thrombocytopenia / heparinhibited thrombocytopenia / heparinhibited thrombocytopenia (HIT / HITTS), was not induced to induce platelet aggregation reaction.</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy subjects and in patients, Bivalirudin shows an anti-dose and concentration-dependent anticoagulatory effect, which is demonstrated by the prolongation of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">If one PCI was subsequently performed in the patients, an additional bolus of 0.5mg / kg of Bivalirudin should be given and the infusion for the duration of the surgery increased to 1.75mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2928">In the arm A of the ACUITY study, unquestioning Heparin or Enoxaparin was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients with unstable angina / non-invasive surge infarction (IA / NSTEMI).</seg>
<seg id="2929">Patients in arm A and B were also randomized to obtain a GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor either before the start of angiography (at the time of randomisation) or with the PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2930">In the ACUITY study, the characteristics of high-risk patients, requiring angiography within 72 hours, were spread evenly across the 3 arms.</seg>
<seg id="2931">About 77% of patients had recurrent ischemia, 70% had dynamic EKG- changes or increased cardiac biomarkers, 28% had diabetes and about 99% of all patients underwent a angiography within 72 hours.</seg>

<seg id="2938">The 30-day results, based on quadruple and triple endpoints of a randomised double blind study involving more than 6,000 patients (REPLACE-2), are shown in Table 10.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Clinical studies with a small number of patients provided limited information on the application of angiotoxin in patients with HIT / HITTS.</seg>
<seg id="2940">The pharmacokinetic properties of Bivalirudin were evaluated in patients undergoing a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) as well as in patients with ACS.</seg>
<seg id="2941">It is expected that Bivalirudin as peptide is undergoing a catabolism in its amino acid components with subsequent revaluation of the amino acids in the body pool.</seg>
<seg id="2942">The primary metabolism resulting from the split of the ARG3 pro4 binding of the N-terminal sequence through thromboin is not effective due to the loss of its affinity to the catalytic center of thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2943">The elimination takes place in patients with normal renal function after a first order process with a terminal half-life of 25 ± 12 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Based on conventional research on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, genotoxicity or reproduction toxicity, preclinical data do not identify any particular dangers to humans.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used for the treatment of adults, adolescents and children over six years with diabetes that require treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, the thighs or the upper arm injected or administered as a permanent infusion with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate the glucose level (sugar) in the blood or the insulin can not be processed effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin lulisin differs very slightly from the human insulin, and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter duration than a short-acting human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was studied in the application in combination with a long-acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study of 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In type 2 diabetes, in which the body of insulin can not work effectively, Apidra was studied in a study of 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood, which indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was observed in comparison to a decrease of 0.14% in insulin collimato.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0.30% with human normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin swallisin or any of the other ingredients, or in patients who already suffer from hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra may need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission granted the company Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH a permit for placing Apidra in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">As subcutaneous injection, Apidra can be applied either in the area of the abdominal wall, the thigh or the delta muscle, or subcutaneous by continuous infusion in the area of the abdominal wall.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the reduced glucose-ogenesis capacity and reduced insulin metabolism, the insulin requirement in patients with a restriction of the liver function can be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change of the active thickness, the brand (her-), the insulin type (normal, NPH, zinc-delayed etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the method of production can change the insulin requirement.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3. inadequate dosing or discontinuation of treatment, especially in patients with insulin-based diabetes, can lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis. these conditions are potentially life threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">The conversion of a patient to another type of insulin or an insulin from another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change of the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of occurrence of hypoglycemia depends on the active profile of the insulin used and can therefore change when changing the treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2983">The substances that increase blood sugar-lowering activity and increase the tendency to hypoglycemias include oral antidiabetics, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, discopyramide, fibrate, fluoxetine, monosamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifyllin, propoxyphene, salizylates and sulfonamide antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, under the effect of sympathetic medications such as beta blockers, Clonidine, Guanethidin and reserves may be attenuated or absent from the symptoms of adrenergic counter regulation.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal experimental studies on reproductive toxicity did not show any differences between insu- linglulisin and human insulin related to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin action occurs in human breast milk, but insulin is generally not absorbed into the mother's milk, nor is it resorbed after oral use.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Listed below are the undesirable pharmaceutical treatment known from clinical studies, grouped according to system organ classes and sorted by decreasing frequency of their occurrence (very common: ≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 100; rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 100; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 100; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 100; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 100; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 100; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 100; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000; not known (frequency based on the data available).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold - sweat, cool and pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or tenderness, anxiety, unusual exhaustion or weakness, confusion, concentration difficulties, dizziness, excessive hun- ness, headaches, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">If Lipodystrophy is missed to continuously change the injection point within the injection area, a lipodystrophy may occur at the injection point.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycemias with unconsciousness can be treated by a intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg), given by a correspondingly trained person, or by intravenous administration of glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After a glucose injection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the severe hypoglycemia and avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose (especially through skeletal muscles and fat) as well as the inhibition of glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that the action occurs more quickly with subcutaneous GA- be of insulin lulisin and the active duration is shorter than with coughing normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study involving 18 male individuals aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes mli- tus, insulin lulisin showed a glucosal effect proportional to the dose, and 0.3 E / kg or more a disproportionate rise in the glucosal effect, just like the human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin lulisin has twice as rapid impact as normal human insulin and achieves the complete glucosal effect about 2 hours earlier than the human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">It was clear from the data that a comparable post-prandiale glycemic control was achieved 2 minutes before the meal, as with a human normal insulin, which is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">If insulin absorption was taken 2 minutes before the meal, a better postprandiale control was achieved than with human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin absorption is directed 15 minutes after the start of the meal, a similar glycaemic control is achieved, such as with a human normal insulin, which is given 2 rents before the meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin lulisin at gift 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before) before beginning of the meal compared to human normal insulin, which was given 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 min) before the start of the meal (Figure 1A) as well as compared to human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
