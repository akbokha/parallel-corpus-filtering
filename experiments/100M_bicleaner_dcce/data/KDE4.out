the package &amp; package ; contains several modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite its small size , they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some features of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making them more readily available .
further information about the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the user manual too &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or .
to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Set@@ ting Exten@@ sions .... Open the box maps tools and select the modules you want .
this is a list of standard settings from the box k@@ de ; add@@ ons . please note that possibly more modules are on your system if you have additional software installed .
you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; it contains before you compile this package .
to use the crash module , click in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; on Tools crashes . then you can view the page , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; crash , or delete the list of crashes , if present .
the View Filter Module ( also called folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Tools In@@ spec@@ tor . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; filter the current working directory in different ways .
to use the DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Extras DO@@ M Tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently displayed web page . as default , the display begins with the root node of the document , for example : docum@@ ent@@ Element , all other nodes are sub @-@ elements of this root node .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides another view for objects with the MI@@ ME @-@ Type in@@ ode / directory on local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol and text views to view the contents of your local file system .
the peculi@@ arity of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists in representing ne@@ sted folder hierarch@@ ies using a so @-@ called tree map . tree maps allow the representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rec@@ tangle , whose area is propor@@ tionally to its size . this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the child objects is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
at &amp; FS@@ View , the size is the size of a file or folder , where the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files can easily be detected even if they are far below in the folder hierarchy . therefore , &amp; FS@@ View can be seen as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX command .
in &amp; FS@@ View , an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap display is a rec@@ tangle representing a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . for easier navigation , the rectang@@ les have useful color and labelling settings .
the color of a rec@@ tangle that is switched over View Colour Mode can either represent depth for easy recognition of the ne@@ sting depth or the picture of another file property such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type .
a rec@@ tangle can be lab@@ eled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder . for each property , you can specify whether it is displayed at all , only if there is enough space to display or whether the area of subordin@@ ate rectang@@ les occur . furthermore , you can specify the relative position of the label in the rec@@ tangle .
for tre@@ em@@ aps , the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . at the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View , this goal is not always met . frames are drawn to represent the ne@@ sting of entries , and this frame will need space , which is then lost to the subordin@@ ate entries . note that less space is lost for the frame when the rec@@ tangle is square .
how spl@@ itting the area of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries is left to the implementation . here it is always advantageous for cap@@ tion and avoid@@ ance of space losses through frames in such a way that rectang@@ les are created that are as square as possible . the best methods in this regard are rows , columns or recur@@ sive divisions .
you can specify the minimum displayed area for an entry over the menu entry View An@@ hold on area . instead , a diamond pattern will be drawn into the area of the higher @-@ level entry , to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a lower entry .
originally &amp; FS@@ View was designed as a small test application and introduction to the usage of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ get developed for the application of K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind .
the View picture gallery can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Tools Picture Gallery ... or using C@@ trl ; I .
when you visit the Picture Gallery module , a dialog opens which allows you to specify the image of the gallery .
the title of the page allows you to customize the title of the picture gallery page in a text entry field .
the option images per line has a sli@@ der and a script to set the number of mini images of each row in the gallery .
the box to display the filen@@ ame of the image indicate whether the file names are displayed in the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
using the image box to display the file size of the image indicate whether the file size is displayed in the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
the image size check box indicates whether the size of the images is displayed in the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
in the Fol@@ der dialog , specify where the gallery will be saved and which sub@@ folders will be included .
in the File selection Save in HTML file , enter where the HTML page is to be saved .
with the sub@@ folder check box you can set with a sli@@ der or a rotation field , up to which level the sub@@ folders are included .
use the check box to copy original pictures to see if the original pictures should be copied to the gallery .
using the comment file in the box , you can specify a comment file for the cap@@ tion of the images in the gallery .
in the check box O@@ wn color depth , you can adjust a different color depth for the thumb@@ nails than in the original pictures .
the module &amp; HTML ; -@@ Settings provides easy access to the general &amp; HTML ; -@@ Settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
the module &amp; HTML ; -@@ Settings can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ menu in Tools HTML settings . the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here :
media playback for the navigation pane can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ menu under the navigation pane window or using the F@@ 9 keyboard short@@ cut .
to play , click on the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or navigation pane ; and drag the music files you want to listen to in the media playback .
modify browser recognition add a menu entry in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; add the browser and operating system identi@@ fier for individual domains . this is useful for websites that allow access only with certain browsers .
the default browser recognition of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; is Mozilla / 5.0 ( compatible ; Kon@@ quer@@ or / 3.3 ; Linux ) ( K@@ HTML , like G@@ eck@@ o ) . if you come to a website that refuses access with this browser , change the browser recognition in one of the following options .
changes the identi@@ fier in M@@ SI@@ E for sites that reject access with browsers on the basis of Mozilla . for example , you need the M@@ SI@@ E browser recognition to call with the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; Hot@@ mail .
pages that do not correspond to the W3@@ C standard or use your own &amp; HTML ; - elements and attributes are displayed correctly with the identi@@ fier of this out@@ dated browser .
this option will use the browser identi@@ fier for all pages of the site you are currently visiting .
with the menu entry ... you can set the amount of information about the browser used and the operating system in the individual .

an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and your photos can be downloaded directly in &amp; Edit ; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the g@@ photo@@ 2 library . of course , any medium and every card reader that is supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ cam ; work together .
&amp; Edit ; includes fast image editing with basic image editing tools . you can use them to view , comment , rate and correct your photos . the editing capabilities can be easily extended with K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface ( manual ) modules .
although &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; easy to use , dozens of professional skills are available . it works completely in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support shell conversion using li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG export and ICC color management workflow .
improved database with considerably more metadata , such as eg ; via the camera or the lens that can be searched .
like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs is also &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; an open source project . that means it depends on the support of the end @-@ users . therefore , you should report problems and improvement possibilities .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; try to make the reporting of problems or improvement suggestions as easy as possible for them . wherever you are in the program , the Help menu contains an entry problems or wishes ... This will open a dialog with an under@@ lined link . if you use these links , your web browser opens a page in the bug reporting system . all required information is already registered here . follow only the instructions to send your report .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; is a project supported by a community . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ cam ; if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ cam ; if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ cam ; then we would encourage you to answer questions to other users of &amp; digi@@ cam ; however , in this mailing list English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful in this language .
you can also visit the digi@@ code ; homepage to learn news about released versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ cam ; to learn .
the best start to join &amp; digi@@ plug ; to participate is registration in the developer mailing list . instructions for logging in the developer mailing list of &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
if you &amp; Edit &gt; start for the first time , you &apos;ll be asked where to save your images and your database . you can specify a local , remote or remote folder here . simply enter the path name or click the folder icon folder icon to select a folder .
in the second field you need to specify a local folder on your computer . here the data file is stored . this path will remain the same for all image folders .
later you can add as many folders as you would like . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; will also use as Al@@ ben@@ bibliothek . settings digi@@ K@@ am set up collections
if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk , you can specify the top folder that contains images , as a basic folder . &amp; Edit each sub@@ folder as an album . no picture will be changed . while the folder is searched , you will see a progress indicator like this :
&amp; Edit ; dur@@ st recur@@ sively search the library path across its depth . you cannot exclude sub @-@ folders unless it i@@ ste to hide in hidden folders . this can be done by placing a dot in front of the name of the sub@@ folder .
if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ list don &apos;t have photos as symbols . you can change this by using any photo from the album and put it on the folder icon . this will then be used as an album icon . see the Albums tab for more details .
once you have configured the base folder , you can set up &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze your digital camera . after that , you should learn how to use My Albums and My keyword list to manage your photos in the albums .
raw file support : if you are using the raw mode of your camera , this can &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze ; possibly also b@@ ypass this . support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help menu support .
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Ro@@ h @-@ Dec@@ oder@@ 2 and Ro@@ h workflow .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and your photos can be downloaded directly in &amp; Edit ; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the g@@ photo@@ 2 library . of course , any medium and every card reader that is supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ cam ; work together .
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . for actual transmission to the computer , the camera is often used as a USB mass storage device . the connection can also be realised via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives . older cameras may use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; uses the program g@@ Audio@@ 2 for communication with digital camera . g@@ Photo 2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely used protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transmission of images from digital cameras to computers and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need for additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the calcul@@ ator . since photos are generally large files and are trans@@ missions above the serial port slowly , this connection is now ob@@ sol@@ ete . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of the images with g@@ Photo 2 . see this link for a complete list of supported cameras .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 has to have been created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support to reliably read the thumb@@ nails of digi@@ K@@ am . if the Ex@@ if support is not present in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you may be unable to see thumb@@ nails or the generation could be very slow .
one of the nic@@ est things to do &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze is how easy it is to extend its functionality through modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ cam ; to develop K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ views . the aim is to provide the modules to all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way as a user can . their advantage is that it is much simpler , &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; by writing a small module to add a function when the changes in &amp; digi@@ kam ; even perform .
to simplify the window , you can either remove the page strips with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ trl + Shift + F .
drag and drop pictures works everywhere : you can store a picture in another part of the tree , above the horizontal divi@@ der line or in another application window . the only restriction is that one image cannot be stored in keywords , date list or search .
- A file type sel@@ ector allows you to extract the most common formats : JPEG , PNG , TIFF , raw , movies and audio
the text filter is used only for the fields currently displayed in the symbol view . so the filter on the filen@@ ame only works if this is displayed in the symbol view . which fields can be displayed in the dialog of the Al@@ ben@@ Settings dialog .
the View &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ i ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view of your photo albums . all the photos taken by &amp; digi@@ kam are stored in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were stored on the hard drive , according to the name of their collection in the album properties or after the date the album was created first . the date can be changed in the properties of the album .
if you have created a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . select to scan pictures directly to an album . you can also add a screen@@ shot directly to an album . select album Import screen@@ shot .
to copy or move an image from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it . in the then appearing menu , you have to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . you can also move or copy several photos in the same way . simply select all the photos and move them to the target album .
an album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to input information about this collection . to access the album properties , you need to right @-@ click on the album and select album properties from the context menu .
album collections : are a method to select your albums so that you can be group@@ ed under a common name . selecting or del@@ eting new collections by collection . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do this in the settings for collections .
the album date : used when you sort your albums by date with view albums by date .
the buttons El@@ der , average , New Year : these put the date on that of the oldest , the newest picture or the average of the album . this will first try to calculate the average of the images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of the last change of each file is used in this folder instead .
when you first have an album in &amp; Edit , open , the first picture in the album will be selected as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; this is meant to help you remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo on the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as an album icon , select the image with the right mouse button and select the Album &amp; quot ; As an album preview . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
an album can only be included in a collection and collections cannot be ne@@ sted .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; supports entering keywords for individual photos in the area My keyword list at the bottom of the main window . album collections have a different effect . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
the image window provides you with the main view of your photos . when you select an album , all images in this album are displayed in the image window . each photo is displayed in a preview , you can customize the size of this preview with the two magni@@ fying buttons in the toolbar .
when you open an album for the first time , you need to wait short while the thumb@@ nails are generated . you can avoid this by using the Extras Show All preview images from the Tools menu .
information on each image is displayed below the corresponding thumb@@ nail . what information is this , you can edit settings digi@@ ti@@ zed ; change settings here . select the Albums tab and adjust the preview images to your preferences .
the thumb@@ nails have help windows that appear . if you leave the mouse poin@@ ter a moment over a picture . the help displays the most important features including all key words of a photo . the screen@@ shot at the top of the section Intro@@ duction to the main window displays such an help window .
photos are everything with &amp; digi@@ cam ; works . albums and tags allow you to organize your pictures in the same way as it suits you . image editing displays your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to them . you can choose between viewing the images , a slide show or the editing of images .
you can open the image editing with a photo by selecting either F@@ 4 image editing ... or selecting the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and editing pane . in section digi@@ cam ; image editing you will find instructions on how to edit your photos . with image editing , you can view and change your photos .
it can happen that &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the sub@@ menu of Open . for this , and how to customize it to your needs , if your program is not listed , you will find information in &amp; k@@ de ; manual .
you should note that after editing by other image editing software there may be problems with the metadata shown in the picture . some programs do not store this data with you when you save the changed image . thus , this information is lost from the EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aperture etc .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; provides two options for rotation . the easiest way is to click the thumb@@ nail to preview and rotate . in sub @-@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the filen@@ ame of a photo , you can right @-@ click on the preview and select F2 ren@@ aming from the context menu . keep in mind that you maintain the extension ( .@@ jp@@ g , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) .
if you want to delete a photo &amp; edit it , it is moved to the tr@@ ash bin of &amp; k@@ de ; postpon@@ ed . F@@ 8 Picture Del@@ ete or Del@@ ete If you prefer to really delete , you can use this by using Shift ; Del .
&amp; quot ; My Dat@@ um@@ sli@@ ste@@ quot ; organizes your photos using the data . &amp; Edit ; used for either the EX@@ IF date or , if it is not available , the date of the last modification of the file .
if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month are displayed in the image view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the date view so that you will only be shown the photos of the selected days .
photos with keywords provided a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos . tags are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned individual photos or entire groups . once a keyword has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search .
if a keyword is selected , all the photos marked with this keyword will be displayed .
keywords can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . this allows you to organize your keywords lo@@ gically . you can also fold up parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My key word li@@ ste@@ quot ; so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for .
the keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG . so you can also use your keywords in other programs as soon as &amp; digi@@ cam ; the pictures are noticed .
you can add new keywords by right @-@ clicking either on &amp; quot ; My key word ; or click on an existing keyword and then select a new keyword . if you have cli@@ cked on an existing keyword , this keyword will be added to the keyword of this keyword .
you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting Del@@ ete . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the cue word is removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a keyword by drag@@ ging it to the desired position in the tree and put it there . then a menu that gives you the possibility to move the keyword . a keyword can be at a time only once in the tree .
you can change the properties of a keyword by clicking it with the right mouse button and selecting the keyword in the context menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My keywords .
to select another photo as an album icon , select the image with the right mouse button and select Add as an album preview . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
to use this feature with keywords , you first have to add keywords . this can be done in two ways : once you have selected the photos you want to use with a keyword , you can click on the appropriate keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My key word . alternatively , you can also click on the appropriate cue point in the tree &amp; quot ; My key word . alternatively , you can also click with the right mouse button on the preview of the images and select the cue point from the context menu .
you can select a photo with any number of keywords . the photo is displayed as soon as you select one of the words attributed to it . in this way you can give a cue for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was taken , one for the event it was made , etc .
once you have provided a photo with keywords , it will be displayed in the main window under the preview of the image .
you can remove a keyword in which you can use the right mouse button to open the context menu of the photo and select Remove from the Tags menu . the menu displays only the keywords that have been assigned to the photo .
the tim@@ eline view shows a time @-@ dependent adjusted hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be moved by this hist@@ ogram . to select a tim@@ ef@@ r@@ ame you just have to click on the bottom rec@@ tangle of the box that indicates the time unit . this displays all associated images in the main window .
in the field below you can enter a title and save your selection . this will appear in the list below .
include all elements of the database : names , ratings , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and in the future even more .
secondary er Such@@ box is a small lamp that is green when the search hits matches . if you click here , the filtering will be deleted and all pictures are displayed again . if The Search did not find , then the lamp becomes red .
the advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side@@ bar with the bin@@ oc@@ ulars . if you open this you can save a simple search box as described above . you can save this search here but as a live search , which always filters what you entered as a search criterion . after you have saved the filter in the list .
when you are satisfied with your selection , press OK and search will be done . the results will be displayed in My search list in the main window . if you want to change your selection after the search , you just need to select the corresponding entry from the View My search list and select an option in its context menu .
when you select Edit Search , the search form will appear again with the search information you entered . if you select to edit Advanced search , the advanced search dialog appears to change your previous search . more information can be found in section The Search tool for Advanced search .
if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select Del@@ ete from the context menu .
the Advanced search provides you with an advanced search form with many search parameters that you can search in specific fields of &amp; Edit ; s database .
the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Al@@ ben@@ database . all rules are displayed in line , separated by operators . an option can be added to this list with search group / Search group or deleted from it . additionally , you can create searching for type &amp; quot ; AND NI@@ CH@@ T@@ quot ; .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; character@@ izes each image by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows to compare pictures by comparing these signatures . the smaller the difference between two signatures , the more they conform . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is an area in which you can drop each image to find a similar . by means of a Schw@@ ell@@ ert , the result selection can be enlarged or reduced . if you slide a picture from anywhere on the icon of the in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , it will open and you can drop it there .
sketch : free hand colour sket@@ ches : draw a quick sketch and digi@@ ti@@ ze ; find the matching pictures . also here a threshold value can be set .
this tab provides an intuitive card search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can move in or out with the mouse wheel or hold it and move it . move it while you press the left mouse button . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this of course pres@@ upp@@ oses that your images contain ge@@ o @-@ data .
in the field below you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter , which will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a Live Geo@@ folder .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; provides a lumin@@ aire in a separate window with which you can easily compare pictures . it works with all supported image file formats , including raw files .
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ trl ; L Add to the lumin@@ aire from the context menu . the selection will be added to the lumin@@ aire and its window opens . if you are back in &amp; Edit ; main window , you can quickly open the lumin@@ aire with L extras .
from the preview bar you can drag the images you want to compare to the left or right pane of the window and place them there . a small arrow shows you which copy in which window area is visible . if you want to preview synchron@@ ize out of the toolbar and perform zo@@ oming operations on one of the images , then they are also executed on the other image . so you can compare the same area of the two images .
another mode is better suited to quickly select from a series of images . if you navigate with pairs from the toolbar , then the two first images will be automatically loaded into the fields to the left . the right @-@ click image is displayed in the right pane . this simplifies it through a number of similar images .
of course the normal delete actions also work directly from the lumin@@ aire like e.g. F@@ 4 file Edit ...
all image information from the right side@@ bar of the main window is available for both thumb@@ nails . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
at the bottom of each area you will find a built @-@ in pi@@ v@@ ot function that you can see on the crossed arrows . in order to wave the visible area of the image , you need to click it and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; then both images will display the same image area .
the zo@@ oming works just as in other views . just use the zoom sli@@ der under the pictures or C@@ trl ; scroll wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out . this happens in both images when you are in the preview mode .
what is a digital inventory management - apart from the fashion word ? digital inventory management considers every part of the process as follows after the image has been taken up to the final output and permanent storage . each of us records , scans or digital photos stores a form of digital inventory management . most of us do this however not in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to back up , find , protect and use photos again . we look at downloading , ren@@ aming , removing , converting , group@@ ing , backing up , optimizing , waiting and ex@@ porting image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital inventory management assumes , inde@@ xed , categ@@ orized , sec@@ ures , searches , transforms , conf@@ ec@@ tioned and exports content that has a monetary or cultural value . quot ;
metadata is defined as data on data . metadata is , according to your definition , data that provides information about or documentation of other data that are managed by an application or environment .
I dare to say if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer then you will need no longer inventory management to find a specific photo . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then you certainly do not use &amp; digi@@ kam ; . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then you certainly do not use &amp; digi@@ kam ; . the approach to store the metadata in a database as well as in the image files guarantees very fast searching and secure archiving on which you can freely access other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate something into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure . your image files must be organized somehow on your computer . you must decide if you want to save them to a dedicated drive or on a network drive &amp; etc ; make sure that you will have to switch to a larger drive some@@ time .
you may be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be quickly found on your location unless you were in a year several times at the same place . if you make enough photos then you will use sub@@ folders like &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . then export a folder for images you print or publish on a website .
professional photographers have other requirements such as version@@ ing of photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant supply of images to different topics and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % archives and 5 % work files will have and you will then not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content .
what types of files fit together ? separating file types makes batch processing easier . dis@@ connect new files .
the separation of original and working files simplifies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or deriv@@ ative image .
we also recommend saving metadata in the settings page of the metadata in &amp; Edit ; this ensures that EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data are written into the file . if you forget this , you can subsequently save the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the appropriate point in the Album View menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what ? to do this , &amp; digi@@ kam , giving them a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are , of course , the most important ones .
now the actual work begins , since you should now assign each photo keywords , cap@@ tions and an evaluation . of course , you can select all the images that need the same attribute and set the value then . this makes sense because you can focus on the best photos in further work .
now let us use keywords , keywords , as you often say in other programs , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
if you import cat@@ alog@@ u@@ ed images from another source with embedded keyword , then &amp; Edit them ; automatically build the tree for you or insert the images to the right place . re@@ sort the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can simply be done by drag@@ ging a sub @-@ tree to another . the changed key words are edited by &amp; digi@@ cam ; updated as it tracks the sub@@ trees .
the graphic shows how different metadata over@@ lap . this is a very rough representation since each block of metadata consists in truth out of many sections . file names and calendar data are properties of all images .
enough of the keywords - the next section refers to cap@@ tions or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata .
you don &apos;t want to let anybody see your photos simply , you want to share them with your friends , family , photographers and agencies . you are certainly interested in how your photos arrive .
look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you consider it closer then you start to see some details , people , the place .
and now I &apos;m telling you this is the landing place of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after the landing is . wow ! you begin to dream of having associations , memories , the historical span is again present , you may even hear the silence . thus , the cap@@ tion has changed your perception of this panorama completely .
for others looking at your photos , the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transfer the meaning to the viewer , help Him over the motive that you moved has to understand what you understand .
it is fine if an image is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a label for itself alone .
with &amp; Edit , you can save as much text , in an internation@@ alized alphab@@ et ( U@@ TF @-@ 8 ) , as lab@@ eling . you can even set it for a selection of images simultaneously . K@@ DE even exports you a spell ch@@ ecker . if you export your images in web galleries , then these labels will not tell you a second time for publishing .
do you remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find another city without a navigation system ? was it not a boring planet in front of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation is already moving with speed of light .
the possibilities to exploit the ge@@ ol@@ ocation are inn@@ um@@ erable and will be even more po@@ ign@@ ant in the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your journeys using pictures with geographic information . &amp; digi@@ kam , you can also export k@@ ml files that you can open with Google Earth . you can also export the images to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc ; with the Goo@@ gle@@ Maps viewer .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and den@@ otes the practice of using copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same fre@@ edoms are also applicable in all changed versions , so also for the work of others .
the following description tells you what information in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ cam ; should be stored as information :
author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desired to use the name of the photographer , for example to protect the name of the photographer , then the name of a company or organization can be used .
author &apos;s title ( syn@@ onym for the author ) : linked to the author . this field contains the name of the photographer . examples of this may be titles such as : employee photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a copyright notice , this must also be completed .
editor ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the provider field to identify who offers the photo . this does not necessarily have to be the author . if the photographer is a photo agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organisations can be listed here , which you offer the picture to others . if the picture is a stock photo , then the group / agency that offers the picture here is given here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although they do not provide protection against abuse . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with calcul@@ ator can delete or modify them in the picture . for private persons , this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique per picture . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future .
topics : disk failures , disk failures , power sur@@ ges , EC@@ C , transmission errors , ageing of storage media , recovery , redund@@ ancy , des@@ ast@@ er@@ prevention , lifetime , temperature , data size , spread super@@ sti@@ tions
of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or a fire . these kinds of losses are the same ones that can happen to you even with traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section , it &apos;s about problems with the so @-@ called New Media .
K@@ roll on@@ TRA@@ CK , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics which causes data loss .
to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs , these must be handled carefully and you can no longer be trusted as a couple of years . of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which will last longer , harder to get and much more expensive . there are offers about gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years for yourself .
CD / DVD discs can be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write much more reliable . so it &apos;s about choosing the right DVD .
CDs and DVDs are very suscep@@ tible to errors , even if you have just been written . that &apos;s why they use a control sum mechanism to protect themselves . 75 % of the data is only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and control sum@@ ming . despite this massive protection they age by chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scratches , dust &amp; etc ;
for defective CDs and DVDs , there is a convenient program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster that seems to work miracles on CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; it is also not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read damaged data from damaged disks , hard drives , flash media , USB drives , etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to capture the format war against the HD DVD . a dual layer Blu @-@ ray disc can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8.5 GB . all that was said to CDs and DVDs is of course also applicable to the Blu @-@ ray disc .
burn slowly with a good recording device on high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ate format . then read the data again to check you . likewise , you should copy the media with a description , date &amp; author labels and then store them on a clean , dark dry and protected site . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read the media .
disk manufacturers keep your statistics for themselves . your manufacturers &apos; warran@@ ties cover a new disk but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives : disc@@ laim@@ er
in short : disks keep the longest when operating in temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. The error rate is dramatic . electronic parts of the controller are the most common error reason , S@@ MA@@ RT can not detect these errors . some of the errors detected by S@@ MA@@ RT her@@ ald the im@@ pending failure . these are in particular read errors and publishing counter@@ s . the expected life time is between 4 and 5 years .
this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also lose data loss due to a power failure before you have secured the files , but these losses can normally be recovered without any major problems .
while most electrical devices do not account much , the devices with computer chips and high speed processors are different . these can cause serious damage . these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause serious damage . on your computer , these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause complete data loss , hardware ageing , destroyed mother@@ boards and other defects . so protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most common protection against black@@ heads is over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs a part of the energy heat and gro@@ unding the rest . it is usually available in the form of a connector bar . remember , however , that not every connector bar also contains over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , you should make sure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also make sure that it offers protection against lightning strikes and thus protects the properly connected devices .
since an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should make sure that all peripheral devices connected to your system are protected . this also applies to telephone lines and cable mode@@ ms as well . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage protection that also includes a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connectivity to the co@@ axial cable of the cable modem and the TV card .
if you have a laptop , then you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially developed for not@@ ebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem .
while an over@@ voltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines it will not really help you in a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it may therefore be useful to invest in a un@@ interrupted power supply .
in addition to the protection against over@@ vol@@ tages , these devices can automatically provide battery energy when a power failure occurs . this gives you the possibility to save your data and run the system in order . if you buy a UPS , you should be sure that it meets the same quality requirements as a sur@@ ge protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting .
consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed and compare its security in case of electric trouble with the cost of avoiding this . a high quality over@@ voltage protection can get you up to &amp; euro ; 20 costs , A 500@@ W UPS you can pay for less than &amp; euro ; 20 . finally , remember how well your computer is protected with it . finally , remember to always remember all cables before you go on holiday .
the Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can use it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software . Google Shared Storage is another popular offer that allows you to store any amount of data .
they are , however , very expensive compared to the hard drives - 40 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition , you must send the data on the comparatively slow internet .
the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general securing solution .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are given on photos . their free storage is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online . the professional version provides you more , in case of Fli@@ ck@@ r dramatically more . for $ 25 per year you get unlimited storage , which should be verified in reality first .
the web solutions are very safe from the point of view of the data backup . due to the TCP protocol , transmission errors are automatically cleaned and the large companies offer a backup and a distributed memory .
the diagram shows the elements of the transmission chain in the machine . all transfers are suscep@@ tible to transmission errors . the file system Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs provide at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive .
the worst thing about it is that nobody tells you when a transmission error occurred , not when this happened in your hardware . all these disorders remain und@@ et@@ ected until you have one day open a photo and this is destroyed for your surprise . nobody seems to have ever thought about it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer path than that in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses , since they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . you will see thousands of mistakes a year already in 2010 .
Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can deal with disk defects on a low level and are highly Scal@@ able . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a GP@@ L in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it will soon also be available for Linux , and Windows . read this article in English .
Oracle has started its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs file system . this is still in alpha state . it uses the same protection mechanisms that uses Z@@ FS and is also available for Linux ; it is not yet a part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss on not@@ ebooks and 46 % for work@@ station systems . not@@ ebooks already account for 50 % of th@@ ef@@ ts .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it leads to a lower damage , as for example th@@ ef@@ ts or new installations . and it is currently restricted to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no one has been si@@ ghted for a long time .
open source file systems are less prone to data loss than proprietary systems : incorrect , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ F@@ s and X@@ FS to name the broad@@ ened file systems . you can find a very good English article here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : incorrect , only the speed of the investigation process is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file was not stored completely before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : false , theft and human error are the main causes of data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 stop settings from fundamental physical boundaries . it is meant that while the technology continues to develop , there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras go towards 10 meg@@ api@@ xel sensors . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is worse . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolution , you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
you get a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not blame anybody for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are affected every year by data loss . so , secure your data after a plan and test this backup before you make any dangerous like re@@ installing your operating system , the replacement of disks or the res@@ izing of hard drives .
suppose you make daily your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a lightning strikes you if the drive was not connected at the moment .
a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget an airplane disaster : fire , water , electricity , children and th@@ ef@@ ts are dangerous enough for your data . they usually concern a whole room or the entire house .
therefore disaster prevention is always a non @-@ local storage . bring your f@@ uses up the stairs to the neighboring house , into your office or similar .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as said above is a common reason for data loss despite safegu@@ arding the panic . if you have a backup which is not immediately available , then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files to be backed up . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . generates a complete snapshot at two time points : the complete backup and the last differential backup .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . generates multiple snap@@ shots . you can restore the original state at any time in which such a backup was made . this backup comes with a version@@ ing system closest to the exception that it is only scanned and not continuous .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts , r@@ sync only copies the difference of files that have actually been changed . this is compressed and if you want to increase security over s@@ sh .
save important images directly after you have saved them on your computer on a DVD or other optical media .
this procedure allows you enough time to discover and restore losses . at the same time , you come for backup but with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of the working files . at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month . any further di@@ lution should be done manually after which you have made a complete review .
themes : metadata , IP@@ TC data stored in the image file , retained X@@ MP files , original , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ inv@@ enting images and metadata , copying images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , visual equipment , ... , using the Internet .
so that valuable pictures will survive the next 40 years that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
as the future is un@@ predictable due to your nature , you must observe and re @-@ evaluate everything that is being said today . unfortunately , there is no other possibility as a certain vig@@ il@@ ance . every 5 @-@ 8 years you should ask yourself how the current system is backwards compatible . the less variants you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use or switch to open standards supported by many applications .
virtualization is available for everyone nowadays . so if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your storage and security technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the specialist print for the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have planned the scal@@ ability and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition . for * nix systems like &amp; Linux , you can copy this area and reloc@@ ate it to a new disk :
check with the command d@@ mes@@ g if your new disk has been recognized by the system but do not hang it .
&amp; dollar ; dd if = / dev / s@@ db / s@@ db / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollar ; par@@ ted res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollar ; par@@ ted res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; res@@ ize res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ d@@ c # res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ d@@ c # res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ d@@ c # res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source changed when needed
open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no more software which can read it , you can create it yourself . this task will be easier from year to year .
GIF is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market . you should therefore no longer use it .
PNG has been developed as an open source standard to replace GIF . it can store much more . it is loss@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . PNG can recommend g@@ amma and chrom@@ ati@@ city data for improved color assignment on hetero@@ geneous platforms . the disadvantage is that it is relative many administrative information , but not as many as TIFF requires and a slow compression .
TIFF has been widely used as picture format . TIFF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a loss@@ less compression algorithm ( Def@@ l@@ ates ) . it manages images in high quality , but requires very large files . with some cameras , you can store your images in this format . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The Digital Neg@@ ative File Format is a ro@@ yalty @-@ free and open image format developed by Adobe Systems . D@@ NG has been developed due to the need to uni@@ fy camera res@@ sources . it is now available on the TIFF / EP format and committed to using metadata . a handful of camera manufacturers now provide D@@ NG and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon will use it some@@ time .
this is possibly one of the reasons why , around 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; Image resource block quot ; technology of the 90@@ s . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Metad@@ ata platform quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a label technology that allows users to em@@ bed their data into a file . the file information is stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF .
many photographers draw it from an original of your recording , mostly in raw format , to archive . X@@ MP is suitable as it stores the metadata separately from the image file . however , you should think about whether you use D@@ NG as a container and put everything there together .
the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards , supporting a wide range of applications and business models . D@@ C@@ MI &apos;s activities include work on architecture and modeling , discussions and collaborative work in D@@ C@@ MI communities , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and educational efforts to achieve a widespread acceptance of metadata standards and practices .
import pictures from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the images on the camera image are , you can use this as a temporary backup .
convert your raw files to D@@ NG and save them to your raw archive . this function is not yet implemented .
for a fin@@ ite processing you can use external programs . if you re @-@ edit the images with &amp; Edit , then you should add the metadata again . these were sometimes truncated by the other programs .
protect the edited pictures for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . then export them into web galleries , code them to MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to edit your photos in &amp; Edit . in the section Adding a Photo to an Album , you will find a description of how you can add photos that you already have on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for im@@ porting images to your legacy database .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ cam ; connect these to the computer , connect the camera to the display mode and turn it on . you will find a further description in the manual of your camera .
when you start the camera interface , it attempts to connect to your camera . for some cameras this may take a while . if the connection is established , a finished indicator appears at the bottom end and the thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera are displayed . some cameras do not display thumb@@ nails . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol are displayed for any file , photos , movies , music , etc. on the camera .
before downloading the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . with the page bars properties and metadata from the camera interface you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata .
this dialog displays file properties and photo information that are internally stored by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
the tab metadata displays the internal metadata such as ex@@ if , manufacturer &apos;s note , GPS etc. of the image . this information is the same as in the metadata side@@ bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ cam ; or image editing . note that this metadata is not available in some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is click the Download button and then download the selection of All . this will not delete all photos from your camera into a single album in &amp; Edit ; . when downloading , the photos are not deleted and we recommend you to check if the pictures were securely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you do not want to download all photos , you can select only the desired ones with the default selection methods from &amp; k@@ de . once you have selected the photos , use the Download button and then download Sel@@ ected . the selected download button will be downloaded as long as you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , an option New download is available . these images have not yet been digi@@ ti@@ zed by &amp; Edit . in this case , the new images are marked with a star in the preview window . if you choose this option , only the new images will be downloaded .
when you download the Select All or Sel@@ ected CD buttons , a dialog will appear with which you can select the destination folder where the photos are stored . the list of existing albums will be shown in the My Albums tab . then select the destination album from the list and click OK .
after selecting the target album , press OK , and &amp; Edit ; load the photos from the camera to the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all at once by removing the Del@@ ete All button . if you only want to delete some , you need to select them first and then delete selected deleted .
please note that there is no way to restore photos you deleted from the camera . the photos will not be moved to the garbage dump of &amp; k@@ de ; they will be deleted completely . so , you should carefully check if the photos were successfully deleted from the camera . if you want to completely er@@ ase the camera finder , you should do so using the camera , as this is much faster .
the filen@@ ames are usually re @-@ used after the photos were deleted from the camera . this can lead to double filen@@ ames if you load photos from different recording sets into the same album . therefore , it may be useful to integrate the date and time the image has been made into the filen@@ ame .
in the next section you will find options for rotating and mirr@@ oring the image and for dat@@ as @-@ based sub @-@ albums . if you use this latter option , a folder per day will be created automatically .
the options Dur@@ ing the transfer opens three more options that are performed before the photos are stored on the disk . the first two relate the data about the author in the section Standard Aut@@ ori@@ tis@@ ation . if you select this , the corresponding entries will be copied from the Ex@@ if information into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images .
if you want a different date format than the default format , you can use the pre@@ fix Phot@@ o- % Y@@ - % - % d % d : % H : % M : % S in the editing field . to do so , turn on the Date &amp; Time option . for more customiz@@ ations , read the str@@ f@@ time command .
if you use the option camera file name , you have the option to change the file names in lower@@ case . or in upper case letters if you prefer this .
the new file name , the &amp; digi@@ cam ; used for a photo , is displayed below the name that the camera provides in preview . your settings for ren@@ aming will be saved and used automatically when you next time open the camera window .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; can use all information about the orientation of the camera to the time point recording to perform automatic rotation during shut@@ down . not all cameras provide this information . in the section page bar metadata , you can read more details about the information that your camera embedded in the photo .
the automatic rotation is usually switched on , and if your camera does not deliver this information , &amp; digi@@ cam ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic turn , use the Advanced button and select the Automatic Rotation in the bottom of the window .
if your camera provides information about the date on which the photo was taken , it can &amp; digi@@ kam ; use this to automatically download sub @-@ albums in the target album . all images with the same date are loaded into the same sub @-@ album . not all cameras provide this information . in the section page bar Met@@ a data , you can read@@ just what information your camera could have embedded in the photos .
this option is normally off and saved &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed in this case ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to switch this option . use the Advanced button and select the date @-@ based sub @-@ albums at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is to download . then select Upload . the file selection dialog and k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files to be uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the default &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image selection is done , &amp; digi@@ kam , you where the images should be uploaded . select the folder you want and click OK to start the upload . the images will not be deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a generic term in this document . it refers to a position indicated in long@@ itude and l@@ atitude and can be displayed on a map . the data can be determined by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system .
not only for professional photographers , it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatically receiving the GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architecture offices and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you have forgotten where exactly the photo was taken , you can open a browser with a click that shows the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ cam ; users who want to locate the location of the photo , or simply want to document this aspect , it is good to save the position data of a photo .
the question is , how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that exi@@ v2 supports many GPS data fields , such as direction , saddle and map references . so , the question is actually more than the data entered into these fields ? there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the right hardware , via a post @-@ processing of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical attri@@ bution ( manual ) and last via manual input of known places .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few who work with GPS receivers . either as card module or by transmitting the data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ri@@ co@@ h Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ d or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . however , you have to save these data in the g@@ p@@ x format , as this is the only format supported by the ge@@ o @-@ mapping module .
there are different programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS which can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and from GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and l@@ atitude or other data , you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool from Phi@@ l Harv@@ ey . it uses the acci@@ dent@@ als of hair@@ y coordinates created by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle for example .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com does not show European street maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish which show all navigation details for Europe .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; attempts to give you so much control over its work processes as possible . there are many settings that change the behavior of &amp; Edit ; select Settings dialog . the Settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these by clicking on the icons of the left @-@ hand side .
select action can be displayed on Embedded preview or start image editing . you set the default behavior of &amp; Edit ; fixed when you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation and copyright data . these data are automatically written to the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields when the option is selected when downloading from the camera interface . also for database synchronization these data are written in the IP@@ TC fields .
author &apos;s title is a syn@@ onym for the author &apos;s line : this field should contain the professional description of the photographer . this can be names such as a photographer , freelance photographer or an independent , commercial photographer . since this is a more detailed description of the author field , this must also be filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to specify the photo . this does not need to be the author if this is for a news agency , such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations should be entered here as they provide the picture to others &amp; quot ; . if the image is a bearing photo , then the group or agency that provides the image should be listed here .
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC ri@@ ms . this ensures that the metadata is permanently contained in the image and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ kam ; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported into &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; imported without getting lost .
save cap@@ tions as embedded tags ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos , with the cap@@ tions embedded in the images . note : images that already contain labels will be over@@ written by digi@@ ti@@ zing them .
the Settings page contains all the options for the information that appears when the cursor is in the main window over a file . depending on the option selected , this information will be displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ kam , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list . any file in one &amp; Edit ; album folders that will not have any of these extensions , by &amp; digi@@ cam ; ignored .
you can reset the default settings again by pressing the Ref@@ res@@ h button on the right of each category .
the settings of the lumin@@ aire by &amp; Edit ; can be set to default values on this page . each time you then open the illuminated table , these settings are switched on if possible . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is then not available . if you have one , then you can get better viewing results .
by default , image editing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can turn off the toolbar if you use image editing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark@@ er or light color in the image . these colors are set here . in the image processing , this View Mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
with Chro@@ ma @-@ Sub@@ sampling it is meant that the images are enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of lumin@@ ance than in the color information . please read this article in Wikipedia for a closer explanation .
with the view of PNG compression , you can reduce the size of PNG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality since PNG utilizes a loss@@ less algorithm . if you have a fast machine , you can set this value to a high compression .
with the option to comp@@ ress TIFF files you can switch the default compression algorithm for TIFF images . this reduces the size of the TIFF images . it has no effect on image quality since the default algorithm works loss@@ less .
with the Settings loss @-@ free JPEG 2000 files , you can save loss @-@ free . even if you select the los@@ sy settings , the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than with normal JPEG . when this paragraph has been written , metadata has not yet been supported but was in the planning .
in previous versions of &amp; Edit , image editing was only a picture viewer for photos . currently , it quickly develops into a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of image editing .
the standard acceptance is that all green pixels are the same . if you are sensitive to ultra@@ violet light when the pixels are sensitive to ultra@@ violet light , this difference creates a lat@@ tice pattern in the output . if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimal loss of details . this option marks the image a bit soft , but eliminates the 2x@@ 2 lat@@ tice pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic colour balance is used .
this setting is only used when the white balance is not set . standard is a fixed color balance based on a white card that was photograph@@ ed in sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD S@@ LR cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed pictures get more details in the top lights in four steps . for other cameras , this option is ignored .
the standard is the pointed @-@ out lights , so the parts of your images which are burned out due to the inability of your camera to capture the sky@@ lights as a continuous white . finally , you can try to re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the re@@ apers .
this is possible because blue pixels are generally not as fast as green and red . &amp; digi@@ kam ; and d@@ sc@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red portions from the yet un@@ saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a question how much color or white you want .
when selecting the Rec@@ on@@ struction option , you get the possibility to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be adjusted individually for each picture .
set the lumin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably need to set it slightly higher than standard 1 . however , this can also be done later in the image options of &amp; digi@@ cam ; image editing . to keep the time for the dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing small , you should proceed conserv@@ atively .
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture of the partial raw data generated by the color filtered image sensor that has many cameras and which provides a matrix of colored pixels . this algorithm is also known as C@@ FA inter@@ pol@@ ation or color construction .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; and D@@ cra@@ w provides you three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it looks like A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for Adap@@ tive Hom@@ ogen@@ ous Direc@@ ted ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w . it creates color art@@ ef@@ acts on the edges . bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting if you are looking for a fast solution with an acceptable result .
if you know the color deviation of your lenses you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for a color gra@@ ding correction since it is performed during the conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions how to re @-@ exist . there is also L@@ CMS and &amp; Edit ; information such as the color information from one color space to translate into the other is to make the colors as accurate as possible .
behavior Questions when an image opens in image editing / Start color management module with raw files .
color Profile Fol@@ der Sets the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you can save all your profiles . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; examine this folder then during startup .
settings of the ICC @-@ Pro@@ files You have here the option &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles , everything can be changed later when opening the raw file .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your pictures color managed not the entire screen .
the input profiles should fit to the camera manufacturer and model you use . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , such as Canon , which do not contain color mapping or g@@ amma correction . currently , d@@ sc@@ w G@@ amma doesn &apos;t correct conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you have to do the mapping itself .
there are other options such as the Soft Pro@@ of Profile that you can em@@ ulate as your image would be returned from a device . this is very useful before you print a picture as your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors therefore can work very saturated . this could be manually corrected instead of rel@@ ying on the blind algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras , it is quite obvious which colour profile is intended for . unfortunately , not with the models from Canon . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . of course , this answer is in@@ official :
the Canon profile extension makes it possible to recognize the style for the goal : F for an exact style , L for landscapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for the standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; image plugin interface . it is an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and image editing . by providing this interface it can &amp; digi@@ kam ; many modules support that are written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select the ones you want to use , and these will then be loaded by &amp; digi@@ cam ; loaded . these modules appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition you will find some also in the context menu of the preview .
short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings Short commands .
further information ( in English ) via K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained via the K@@ IP@@ I project under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the slide show should be easy to understand . the upper knob adju@@ sts the time between the transitions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds are good . the other check boxes turn the metadata on or off , which are displayed at the bottom of the images while the ad is displayed .
the camera characteristics show on the left side a list of all cameras currently supported . on the right side there is a button Automatic detection , which tries to identify a camera that is connected to the computer . if you want to use this , make sure the camera is properly connected , turned on and in balance mode .
at the bottom , you can set the path for USB and Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) -@@ mass storage cameras . this field is only active if you have selected a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera list . you must specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / para , on which you mount your camera .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ cam ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring it into the display mode and turn it on .
check if &amp; Edit ; the camera automatically detects . if not , you can set camera models and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera menu .
you can select any name for your camera . it is displayed in the main window of the main window . if you have more than one camera , you can insert it here .
with the Option confirmation dialog for moving &gt; Show images in the M@@ ül@@ lei@@ mer display , you can adjust the dialog by &amp; Edit ; set a photo in an album when del@@ eting a photo . in the sections del@@ eting a photo and del@@ eting an album , you will find more details .
the editorial changes by the right side@@ bar can be tac@@ itly using &amp; digi@@ cam ; apply if you use the option to apply changes in the right side@@ bar without promp@@ ting . otherwise , you need to save the changes with the button changes .
you can also display &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze the welcome screen display ; under certain circumstances , this acceler@@ ates the start of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zing ; .
the setting At start for new photos is forcing &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zing ; searching the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos . this extends the startup time of &amp; digi@@ kam ; if something was deleted from the base folder , &amp; digi@@ kam , you know if it should delete them from the database .
various color schemes can be edited in &amp; Edit ; used to customize the main window to suit your taste . these settings can be selected from the toolbar in Settings . previ@@ ewing the available designs will be listed below :
these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ cam ; to create , you will find more information about this in this tutorial .
&amp; Edit &gt; includes fast image editing with some basic tools . you can use them to view your photos and for correction and improvement . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by selecting the item Show / Edit .
the image editing contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ cam ; so you may not be part of your distribution . for more information on the K@@ IP@@ I modules , see Set@@ ting up the Image Processing section .
a status bar at the bottom of the window displaying the file name , current file number , magni@@ fication factor and the current image size .
a menu bar at the top and below the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently required functions .
editing functions of image editing change your photos . however , none of the features will change the original photo before using File Save or the Save button from the toolbar . note that you can no longer restore the original photo once you have saved the image .
you might want to make a copy of your image before you change it . this can be done with File Save as .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by restoring from the File menu or using the Rec@@ over Rec@@ over button restoring in the toolbar . you then lose any change you have done on the photo since the last saving .
almost every image processing action can be und@@ one or restored . the last action can be und@@ one by editing or restoring rever@@ ting or restoring from the menu .
if you use this frequently , you should use the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ trl , -@@ Z to und@@ o and C@@ trl ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to restore .
if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; click on the return or restore button in the toolbar for a moment , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in between will also be und@@ one or restored .
once you have started image editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or keyword by drag@@ ging the navigation buttons in the toolbar , image high , image , or the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes to the current photo , you will be asked if you want to save them .
you can enter the photo in and out in which you use C@@ trl ; mouse wheel or the icons in the toolbar or the entries in the View menu .
to customize a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the toolbar : select the magni@@ fication factor automatically
view Full Screen mode displays the picture in full screen mode . you come into the normal view where you use the Es@@ c key . if you do not want this , you can change this in the Settings dialog by &amp; Edit . this allows you to view this in the Settings dialog by &amp; Edit . this can be viewed from &amp; Edit ; main Window . see the section for setting up image editing .
if you want to print the current image , you can select the image from the File menu and get the standard &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can customize the settings here before printing your photo .
from the main menu , you can print single images or whole sets . whole picture preview pages can be printed from your selection . you just need to select the images with the standard methods and select Print Ass@@ ist from the File menu . if you follow the wizard , you just need to make your choice .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; main window has a side@@ bar at the right edge , which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same side bar is available without the navigation file , even in the editing pane . it is displayed when one of the five tabs is cli@@ cked :
multiple clicking on the same tab allows the side@@ bar to appear or disappear into the margin again .
in the label view , you can enter or insert labels with unlimited size . note the note below . the text is U@@ TF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the labels are copied to EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC fields so that you can be used by other programs .
IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are truncated after 2000 characters and special characters are converted . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling field in other applications , you should consider these restrictions .
after you have commented on , use either the Apply button or simply switch to the next image , the labels are then saved .
in addition to the user button , there is a button More . with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database . however , you can also write the metadata into the files . however , this will always be done if you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written in the images .
the review section shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be applied either by a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or using the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ trl + 0 ... 5 . the rating from the side@@ bar is always applied to one image . to evaluate multiple images simultaneously , select it and use the context menu .
the rating is written in the Re@@ gency IP@@ TC field . coding will follow the scheme in the following table :
the keyword review shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the keyword tree and a selection box with the keywords used previously in this &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; session .
the keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search word . you can quickly limit the number of options when searching for a keyword . this feature is particularly useful if you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom of the screen is a further relief in the input of keywords in a series of pictures . if you have entered different keywords , these are stored for quick access .
keywords can also be set by selecting the appropriate check boxes in the tree . all key words of an image are stored in the keyword keyword .
if multiple images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword tree , this will only be applied to the highlighted image and not the entire selection . if you want to select a selection with a keyword , please read the section Key@@ word Fil@@ ters section .
the keyword filter page bar is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side bar is used with their Album , - Dat@@ a- , keyword and search views . if additionally one or more keyword filters are used from the right @-@ hand side , only the intersection of these two is displayed . all created keywords are available .
you can also drag and drop keywords in the main view . if the keyword already exists , you can simply drag it from the right side@@ bar and place it on the selection . then , a dialog box will appear which asks you if you want to set the keyword .
in the upper example , the main window displays the images on a calendar day . the keyword filter represents no keywords , which reduces the amount to three images . they were selected using C@@ trl + a , and then a keyword is drawn from the right keyword tree to the selection and stored there . a dialog asks if this keyword should be set .
this search for changes takes place at every start of the program . it can also be turned off in Settings Mis@@ cellaneous .
if you have created and created a rule and notice that it should be one or two , you can change this easily by double @-@ clicking on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry after which is searched in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , image , key word , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already set in the database .
for example , you can set an Advanced search on all elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group options , you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the group group . the options will then look like this :

this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly edited it &amp; edited it concrete implementation .
the reason why you use a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colors used by your camera or scanner will have a predictable vari@@ ance from the ones actually photograph@@ ed or scanned . with a color @-@ managed workflow , you can achieve that the colors on your monitor are similar to those of your camera or scanner and the colors that you print or publish on the web that correspond with your digital dark@@ room .
if the theme appears on color management , everyone wants to know which buttons he has to press for the results he wants . unfortunately , color management means that you make informed decisions at any point of the image processing work@@ flows . in addition , links with deeper information will allow you to make your own informed decisions so you can get the desired result .
if your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about color management .
they work on a monitor which is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB colour space . ( more information can be found below )
your only other picture editions are by e @-@ mail or the web , where s@@ RGB is de facto standard .
so if s@@ RGB functions so well and makes life so easy for everyone , why should one use another color space and have to worry about color desol@@ ation ?
a visual example of the limitation of s@@ RGB compared to the colors we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e region , and the colors in s@@ RGB color space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some bigger color spaces , please visit Bruce Willi@@ blo@@ om &apos;s excellent site and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I need to t@@ alli@@ ze my monitor if I chose to work in s@@ RGB color space ?
yes ! whether you are working in the s@@ RGB color space or not , you need to calibr@@ ate your monitor , since s@@ RGB turns out that your ; on@@ it@@ or is on s@@ RGB . if you are working as RGB , you either need to calibr@@ ate your monitor to the s@@ RGB standard , use a suitable monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic corrections , which can improve a picture in most cases . therefore use it before attempting any further manual editing .
the functions Norm@@ alize , Balance , Automatic balancing and contrast extend from the menu Cor@@ rec@@ t Automatic correction try to make the best of your colors . you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best on your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method scales the lumin@@ ous intensity values over the entire image , so that the dark@@ est point is black and the brigh@@ test dot is as bright as possible without changing its color shade . this function is often a magic correction for images which are dark or washed .
compare : this method adju@@ sts the intensity factor of the color of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity channel is as flat as possible . this results in nearly every brightness area the same number of pixels . this results in a very powerful operation , which either causes miracles in an image or destro@@ ys it .
automatic adjustment : this method maxim@@ izes the color range in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and light border tones and adju@@ sts the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogram range .
aug@@ ment@@ ing contrast : this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the highest possible area and a new ji@@ b of all values in between . this is only visible with washed pictures and can be a good correction for poor photos .
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo .
the white balance correction is somewhat limited because of a color space of 8 bits per color . if you can be too far from the original image , you can perform over@@ exposure zones . if you can perform the white balance in raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , then your options for correction will be better .
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by copy@@ righ@@ ted Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ owa . they start using the menu entry colors white balance of image processing .
the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left you can see both the original picture and the preview of the target image . the preview is dynamically adjusted to the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original whi@@ tish , then click on the sub@@ window .
the thumb@@ nail of the target image has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel below this marker is shown as a vertical line in hist@@ ogram .
to the right the hist@@ ogram shows that dynamically changed once you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful since , even in well lit pictures , most pixels have very small lumin@@ ance values . with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . the sum is called lumin@@ ance .
the contrast of your score depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . shadow adjustment lets you improve or even dim the shadow details of your photos .
to play with the above checks , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the color temperature of the white balance . in this way , the temperature and green values are automatically set .
in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of default settings . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed . you will see the combined result in white balance . this is indicated in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the Save as and Lo@@ ading buttons do exactly that . each setting of the white balance you have set can then be saved to a text file and then loaded again .
the Pre@@ ferences button sets all filter values back to their default values and the neutral white balance . note that neutral settings will result in a different picture than your original . if you save it , your original image will be changed .
you can set the encoding depth for each color channel of the edited image . 8 @-@ bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit encoding is better suited for high @-@ quality images . however , this encoding also requires more disk space , calculation time and is only available for formats PNG , P@@ N@@ M , TIFF and D@@ NG .
this tool opens the same dialog as the processing of shell images . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . color mapping can be done by the sub@@ window for the brightness . a detailed instruction for using color profiles allows you to consult the chapter color management .
another important tool is to find sound correction in the menu . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously , allowing you to always make the same mistake and therefore always need the same correction . in the manual for sound correction you will find more information .
a very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; tool color effects provide you with four color effects , a solar effect effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a edge filter .
in times of chemical processing , Solar@@ isation was also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , an effect that arose when one partially developed a short flash light and then completed the development of the picture . the colored , dark@@ er areas protected the sensitive photographic paper from the additional light . this had the effect that the lighter ranges dark@@ er and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second lighting . the result was a partial neg@@ ativity of the image . this tool allows you to fine @-@ adjust this interesting effect .
the intensity checks the pol@@ arization . at approx . 50 % intensity , the picture shows what is chem@@ ically possible . another up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment finally creates a negative image that is not to be produced on photographic paper .
this is an example of the solar installation effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that processes the ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from a satur@@ ation by making a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . just try it , it em@@ belli@@ sh@@ es many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for an in@@ verse colour film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts . the characteristics make it a film of choice for nature photographers . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts . however , these characteristics make it a film of choice for nature photographers . Vel@@ via &apos;s strong saturated colours , however , are too much .
the ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light on the contra@@ sting edges . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the sli@@ der repeti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on light . for large images , the filter can over@@ load the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and lumin@@ osity of the photos . you can try to experiment the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . once you are satisfied with the result , use the O@@ k button and you will be applied .
if you make a photo in poor light conditions , you can get the opposite problem : a too big satur@@ ation . also in this case the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation rather than increase it . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ ous intensity / contrast / g@@ amma , the tool ton@@ em correction is located to improve the exposure . even if the dialog to this tool works very complicated , you only need the range of sli@@ ders for the application described here . more concrete the three sli@@ ders below the hist@@ ogram .
the window contains a graph of the intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . under the graph three sli@@ ders are cli@@ cked into which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn how to use it is to shift the controller and make sure the image changes .
on the right side , the original and preview of the image can be viewed . the preview will be updated dynamically based on the settings of the image . on the left hand side , the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : this selection box shows whether the hist@@ ogram is displayed with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y axis . for images of a digital camera , the linear hist@@ ogram is often dominated by a single pillar . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic division is more useful .
three regul@@ ators : the upper for the dark sounds , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle sounds , often called g@@ amma @-@ values .
the three color pin@@ holes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadows , medium and light sounds . in addition , there is a button for fully automatic adjustment .
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controllers that can be used to inter@@ actively change the output values as with input values . for example , the compression of the output values can be used to create a f@@ ading image as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground .
automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically set in dependence on the intensity values of the image .
save as and load : with these buttons , the set values can be stored in the file system and loaded again later . to do so , the Gim@@ p Levels format is used .
if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ p@@ ette , the input values will be automatically adjusted for all shadows , medium and sun@@ shades . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance channels .
the option over exposure indicator monitors all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you only get the effect displayed in the preview and there is no effect to see the final result .
below is an example of the adjustment of input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) .
the left side shows half of the original and the target image . the preview will be updated dynamically depending on your settings . on the right @-@ hand side , the following options are available :
modified channel : this box allows the channel to be specified which is modified by the module :
next to this box there are two symbols to switch between a linear and log@@ arith@@ mic view . for pictures taken with a digital camera , linear mode is mostly the most useful . for images with large areas of a constant color , linear mode generates a wide beam . in this case log@@ arith@@ mic mode helps .
for example , if you move a curve to the right , e.g. the bright tones , then you can see that these bright tones correspond to dark@@ er output tones and that the corresponding image pixels are dark@@ er .
preview the original photos is a red marker to see . if you move this marker to the area you want to change , a matching line is displayed on the curve representing the original value . create a point on this line and move it then up and down until the value is adjusted according to your taste .
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . every curve you created can be stored in the file system and loaded later . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p curve format .
if you create this method and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow , middle and sun shades . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
the option over exposure indicator monitors all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if you are found in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect to see the final result .
below you can see a black @-@ and @-@ white photo that has been corrected in the lumin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun shades were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the &amp; Edit channel mixer ; image editing is a tool to enhance color channels or change the color shade of the photos .
the Channel Mixer is another sophisticated tool to mix the color tones of the images . you can edit it from the menu color channel mixer of image processing .
with the channel selection box , you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first indication how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash . the left pane of the window will show you a preview . the original can be viewed for comparison with your own rider .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the image , a vertical line appears in hist@@ ogram to show you the corresponding color value .
the controls for the module are below : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you enable lumin@@ ance , the image will retain the overall brightness , as the channel mixer is THE tool to generate great black @-@ and @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black @-@ and @-@ white portraits .
sometimes , especially when mixing mon@@ och@@ rome , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the color . if that &apos;s the case , you can improve your mon@@ och@@ rome conversion by reducing your mon@@ och@@ rome conversion first .
the Save as and Load Buttons are used for this purpose . any mixer setting can be saved for later and then load . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the option over exposure indicator monitors all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you only get the effect displayed in the preview and there is no effect to see the final result .
below you can see a picture in which the blue channel has been read@@ ju@@ sted . the option L@@ umin@@ ance Store is enabled . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography was always fascinating because of your ability to abstra@@ ction . in the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step , because color images can easily be converted on the computer . also with a set of film roll profiles .
Il@@ ford Delta 100 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro 3@@ 200 , Il@@ ford FP@@ 4 Plus , Il@@ ford HP@@ 5 Plus , Il@@ ford P@@ F Plus , Il@@ ford X@@ P2 Super
green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks great , with all scene pictures and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky . so similar to the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter .
orange filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and air photos . so similar to the 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) orange filter .
red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic cel@@ esti@@ al effects and can simulate mo@@ on@@ light scenes at day@@ time . similarly , like the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) red filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
S@@ Epi@@ aton : creates warm and medium sounds while adding a bit col@@ dness in the cock@@ at@@ ons . this is very similar to the process of the emergence of a pressure and the re@@ development in a ser@@ um pad . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother and therefore similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) se@@ epi@@ ph@@ il@@ ter .
with &amp; Edit ; applying tool texture can apply decorative tex@@ tures to an image .
by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color image or not , you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a wall picture on a wall .
relief : shift this parameter to the right increases the impression of the depth or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the image .
a paper text effect has been applied on the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) to see . the relief index has been set to 200 .
with &amp; Edit ; Add tool frame can be added a decorative frame around a picture .
keeping the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . one way to keep his attention is to put the picture a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ attering eye . under Image frames , the module can be started from the image processing .
type : with this parameter set the desired frame type for your image . going through the picture with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce bor@@ dered it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white pictures ) , be@@ v@@ elled it with a nice three dimensional frame . ideal for a button effect and decorative adds a decorative frame with patterns .
width : specifies the width of the frame in percentage . the range of values for the width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
the target image decorated with the frame will be larger than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially if you have used the tool according to aspect ratio previously .
with this handy tool , you can easily insert a format@@ ted text into an image at any location . this also goes to several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text orientation , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need . you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background .
each setting you selected for your text can be changed until you press the button &quot; OK . &quot; once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed .
with &amp; Edit ; applying tool template can place a template over a picture .
the Image Processing menu apply in image processing can be used to lay templates over a picture .
for the template , there are no limitations regarding size and orientation . however , you need to take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) to reduce the file size of the template . if you want to add your template to &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; mail@@ ing@@ list digi@@ cam @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org ..
if you are using this tool for the first time , you need to set your sten@@ cil folder with the Base Fol@@ der button in the dialog . select the folder where you copied the template files . these settings will be noted for the next start .
after the root folder has been set for the templates , a tree view appears that reflects the folder structure of the sten@@ cil . selecting a folder will automatically update the template of the templates .
under the preview you will find three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image .
enlarge This button enlar@@ ges the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
shrink : this button shr@@ inks the underlying image . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole image , you need to shrink the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move the image below the template . take the image and place it at the desired position .
use OK when you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then be automatically adjusted to the preview size .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas .
sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very quick and easy to create , but especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny images .
blur@@ ring mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture shar@@ per . in fact , it sharp@@ ens no bit ; it works rather psycho@@ visual . you can use it to remove atmospheric vap@@ or and it does here a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is protected by Win@@ ston Ch@@ ang .
re@@ focusing might be the best of the three since it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters to adjust .
images without focus as well as most digi@@ ti@@ zed images need a correction of sharp@@ ness . elements that are smaller than the resolution are combined into a common colour . the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper . S@@ LR cameras normally require more subsequently sharpen@@ ing than normal cameras for private users .
in JPEG images , an internal sharpen@@ ing camera is often used . images in the raw format , on the other hand , must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing .
some scann@@ ers use a sharp@@ ness filter while reading the image . if you disable it , you get control of your image .
in some situations , you can get useful results by sharpen@@ ing a photo with sharpen@@ ing tool suit . you can call up sharpen@@ ing with the menu entry .
however , the sharp@@ ness increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also increases the noise . in general , the most useful technique to shar@@ pen one image increases the tool . in general , the most useful technique to shar@@ pen an image will re@@ focus the tool . you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques to focus .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cris@@ p . the solution to draw the picture slightly sof@@ tly is much easier than sharpen@@ ing . use the tool to sof@@ ten the image with the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ ting sof@@ tness and experiment with some settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog will show you the effect on your photo .
the filter Un@@ less mas@@ king is a very good tool to remove sli@@ ders from your photos . you can see a demonstration here .
the original image and preview help to edit the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often produce good results and should be tested first . if you make the blur@@ ring mask too strong , noise and the impression of bur@@ rs will produce close to sharp edges .
the radius adju@@ sts how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . therefore , you should shar@@ pen images best in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the wi@@ ped image added to the original . thus , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the difference amount to be applied . this allows for a minimum difference to be applied to an edge of the filter . thus , areas with a soft transition between the tones are excluded and therefore beauty errors in faces , sk@@ ies and water surfaces are avoided .
this is an example of the blur@@ red filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the painted image the ( 2 ) . blur@@ red mas@@ king was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0 .
this &amp; digi@@ cam ; tool re@@ focus re@@ focus a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ righ@@ ted degre@@ aser algorithm of Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries a picture to &amp; quot ; re@@ foc@@ eren@@ quot ; in which it revers@@ es the de@@ focus . this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Viennese filtration . the traditional technique for sharpen@@ ing images is the use of a blur@@ ring mask . re@@ focusing usually reaches better results than blur@@ red . you can launch it from the menu by re @-@ focus colors in image processing .
in practice , the circular folding works much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;s folding . the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche F@@ altung has a very long tail , which results in the mathematical result also influenced by the swelling pix@@ el@@ ates , which are far from the original source pixel . in most cases , the FI@@ R Viennese in@@ verse of the Gau@@ ß &apos;s F@@ altung is strongly influenced by the distant pixels . this causes un@@ desired results .
circular ac@@ ut@@ eness : this is the radius of circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most images , the default value should result 1 good results . you can set a higher value if your image is very blur@@ red , but pay attention to hal@@ ons .
correlation : an increase in correlation may help to reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . useful values are 0.5 and values near 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation decreases the shar@@ per effect of the module .
noise filter : an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce arti@@ facts . the filter can accept values from 0 @-@ 1 . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 the image quality is very poor . a useful value is 0,@@ 03 . a high value will further blur@@ b the image .
G@@ auss &apos; sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the Gau@@ ß &apos; sharp@@ ness . use this parameter if your blur@@ red gau@@ ze is . this is most often caused by a previously executed blur@@ ring filter . in most cases , you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying art@@ ef@@ acts . if you use a value un@@ equal to zero , you may need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter .
die size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase of the die size can produce good results , especially if you select large values for the circular edge or the G@@ auss &apos; sharp@@ ness . in most cases , you should select a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the Save as and Load Buttons are used for this purpose . any re@@ focused parameter that you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
try to perform all blan@@ ks , color and intensity corrections on the image before using the module .
otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible , but later leave unpleasant art@@ ef@@ acts .
when you read and comp@@ ress images , &amp; eg ; than JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
in general , Un@@ inten@@ sely mas@@ king produces better results than sharpen@@ ing . this could be caused by blur@@ ring mas@@ king a larger neighborhood than sharpen@@ ing .
in theory , un@@ inten@@ sely mas@@ king must always produce art@@ ef@@ acts . even under optimal conditions it is never possible to remove the effect of blur@@ ring . for the Vienna filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal lens filter . practically the result of the FI@@ R Wiener Filter is always at least as good as the blur@@ ring mask . the FI@@ R Wiener Filter is often better in the processing of small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters , applied on a small un@@ focused image :
the original un@@ sharp color image must be corrected . this image has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens .
for more information on the correction methods in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address .
the sli@@ der smooth@@ es the blur@@ ring of the area that was dark@@ ened in order to create a more natural pup@@ il .
the ink ink allows a customized color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones , then you can set this here .
the image error correction tool is one of the most developed tools to remove unwanted arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the painting was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS Lab@@ in in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains different default settings as starting points to simplify the restoration process . the available default settings are listed below :
if you want to fine @-@ tune filter settings , you can use the smo@@ othing and advanced settings .
detail level p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of the details . a small value leads to uniform smo@@ othing over the picture . whereas larger values are mainly smo@@ othing and details are sharp . a value of 0.@@ 9 should keep details in such a way that no sharpen@@ ing is necessary afterwards . please note that the attention should always be subordin@@ ate to direction dependen@@ cy .
directional dependence alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es evenly in all directions while a value is smooth@@ ed close to 1 only in one direction . if you have a film gran@@ ul@@ arity or CCD Partition will produce a high value wave @-@ like pattern . JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts are best removed at a value near 1 .
fl@@ atten &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smo@@ othing factor above all . p then defines the relative smo@@ othing . therefore set this value to the degree of noise in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more is smooth@@ ed . this is necessary if there is a lot of noise , as it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect it must be set higher than 3 .
repeti@@ tions : indicates how often the algorithm is going through . normally , 1 or 2 is sufficient .
angle alignment &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle depend@@ ant integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if alpha is selected small , it should also be selected small . make sure that small angles generate a long run time . thus , you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs .
integral stri@@ de length &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integrated stri@@ de width in pixels . you should set the value of smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smo@@ othing and never exceed 2 .
linear Inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more quality you get by choosing this option is minimal . however , it doubles the duration . we therefore recommend it to release it .
the Save as and Lo@@ ading buttons do exactly that . any setting of image errors can be saved into a text file and later re@@ charged .
correc@@ ting image errors is comparatively very fast at work . however , it may take a long time to load a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation using the Cancel button at any time .
below you can see how image errors are corrected with Small Art@@ ef@@ acts . the module is used on a photo that was taken in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you see , there is a peculiar black artwork in the background that caused by a poor film deposit during the trip . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides selectable image filters to remove stain@@ s and other art@@ ef@@ acts such as dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; -@@ effects of scanned images from books or magazines .
if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial .
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ ined noise which can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases you only need the sub@@ window details and the sub@@ window Advanced Settings can remain with default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large values increase the time the filter per pixel needs and can wipe the image . the area indicated by the radius moves over the image and the color in it is smooth@@ ed and therefore smaller errors corrected .
sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness level . this value sets the pixel pitch the filter for@@ wards to determine lumin@@ ance changes . if the value is too high , the adaptive filter can no longer receive image details and noise or lubric@@ ate occurs again .
edges : controls edge precision for sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong you can &apos;t remove all the noise or noise peaks can occur . set it to a value close to maximum if you want to remove a weak h@@ iss or JPEG arti@@ facts without losing any details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend changing either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not influence the smooth@@ ness process that is controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend changing either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ness process that is controlled by the details settings .
g@@ amma : controls the g@@ amma tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dark@@ er areas , which are typically more rau@@ cous . however , it also al@@ erts the shadow areas .
damp@@ ing : controls the adjustment of the phase shock absorption . this value defines how quickly the adaptive filter radius respon@@ ds to variations of lumin@@ ance . if it is lifted , the edges appear smo@@ other when it is too high . if it is at its minimum , noise and phase j@@ itter may appear on the edges . it can remove noise peaks and is the recommended method for it .
store under and Load : these buttons are used exactly for this . all noise reduction parameters that you have set can be stored in the file system and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . noise reduction was applied with the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cris@@ p for your purpose . fortunately , the solution to draw the picture slightly sof@@ tly is fortunately much easier than sharpen@@ ing a picture . use the tool to sof@@ ten the plas@@ tici@@ ze using the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ ting sof@@ tness and experiment with the smooth@@ ness . the preview window on the right side of the dialog displays the effect of this operation on your photo .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
this restoration filter gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s noise , film bas@@ kets , scratches , compression arti@@ facts and local errors that occur in digital , original or subsequently digit@@ alized pictures . the smo@@ othing takes place along the image contours and thereby gets the content as it also makes the human eye .
the same algorithm can be used for color and texture replacement . texture replacement is performed with another tool , the image error correction . the algorithm for restoration has been developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts reduce : compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far from it . as a los@@ sy compression algorithm , it produces some compression &amp; quot ; Art@@ ef@@ ak@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that can be seen in the un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems .
the Save as and Lo@@ ading buttons do exactly that . each setting of photo restoration can be stored in a text file and later re@@ charged .
photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a very long time and a high CPU load can be drag@@ ged . so you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Be@@ e .
the module is applied to a black and white photo that has been recorded with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera to an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious movie grain on the faces . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected under ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures were applied to an old color photo that was scanned with a scanner . you can see the scan art@@ ef@@ acts caused by the scanner illumination and the photo paper . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; tool Hot@@ pixel makes it possible to remove any image pixels of photos using a CCD camera according to eight . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project protected by Martin Dick@@ opp .
bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially in high @-@ quality raw mode photos since many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixels quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright pixel quot ; on a photo with a dark image sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
load this file into the wizard with the dark image button . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the image preview .
if you have an old digital camera it is important that you take the dark image directly to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should download the appropriate dark image to the image to be corrected . an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels . note that the wizard will notice the last dark image and load it automatically in the next session .
the image area and the preview will help you correct the result within the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with current settings . bad pixels are raised in all preview areas .
select an area to preview the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the filters available :
average : an average of the neighboring pixels is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block . for a one @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to compu@@ te a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
Ku@@ bisch : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to compu@@ te a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic bends ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo taken from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image was enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is below ( 2 ) .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; correction correction is a tool to correct the vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , of an image .
wide angle lenses , especially those in medium and large photo format , can often not uni@@ form@@ ly illumin@@ ate the entire sensor range . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ tier@@ - quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) it reduces the edges and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there . telep@@ hot@@ o lenses may also show this behavior .
many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter , which increases the necessary shutter speed in such a way that it is impossible to use the camera with the hand . wide angle lenses should also be used with center filters , an aperture of f / 16 or smaller , as otherwise un@@ sharpen@@ ing effects are caused by movement .
with the large exposure zones of today &apos;s felt and gra@@ y@@ scale depth of digital cameras and film scann@@ ers , it is possible to simulate the effect of a Center@@ filter by applying an equivalent transformation on a rough image made without this filter . the tool Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ erungs@@ gra@@ ding applies the transformation with a center filter to an image . the algorithm is protected by John Walker .
with three regul@@ ators you can control the vig@@ net@@ ting correction filter and with three further exposure of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light intensity at the point of the largest density the filter . the standard density is 2.0 , which is compensated by an optical filter with an aperture setting of 1 , or random@@ ly a light intensity of 2 , or by chance to compensate for a greater degree of vig@@ net@@ ting , reduce it by a small degree .
lumin@@ ous intensity , contrast and g@@ amma settings : editing an image with the vig@@ net@@ ting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels . you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . the controls only provide positive values , since you only have to increase the settings .
if you want a fin@@ er read@@ ju@@ st@@ ment of the exposure of the target image , let the values for brightness / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ cam ; image editing from the Color Gra@@ dation menu .
this is an example of vig@@ net@@ ting correction applied to an image . the original image ( 1 ) shows the correction in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image . a den@@ ial and contrast correction was also performed in the image with this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geometric distor@@ tions . color distor@@ tions cannot be corrected using this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree treats the general geomet@@ rical distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or conve@@ x form of the image .
the coefficient of the third degree has a similar rounded effect , fl@@ atter but fl@@ atten@@ s on the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the coefficient fourth degree correc@@ ts the removed corners to that of the second degree . if you combine these two , any geometric distortion can be almost eliminated .
general : this value controls the strength of distortion second degree . with negative values , ton@@ ical distor@@ tions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion .
corner : this value controls the thickness of the distortion fourth . this value works more strongly at the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses the &apos; Corner Par@@ ameters &apos; has the reverse sign of the parameter .
zoom : this value sc@@ aled the image size and results in a correction of first degree . negative values increase while positive image res@@ ize .
light : this value adju@@ sts the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase it .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog with a preview illustrates the distortion correction . the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values next time .
the ton@@ nen@@ y- or cushion @-@ shaped correction should be performed before all cutting or res@@ izing changes . best perform this correction as the first one . if you cut a picture again and then perform a ton@@ ical correction , the effect is apparently the wrong .
to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal guide line . move the mouse cursor in the image preview to display the dotted lines . move it to an important place , such as the sea edge or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . subsequently , you can correct the ton@@ nen@@ - / cushion distortion with the help of the lines .
if you correct a ver@@ ting distortion the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove them using the cutting tool in the transformation menu Remove from image editing or via the zoom sli@@ der of this dialog .
the next logical step for some motifs such as shots from the front , frame and paintings is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the image have 90 degrees . note that when you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of perspective .
this is an example of the ton@@ ical correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method to simulate the infr@@ a @-@ red tape of the G@@ imp@@ Guru and org web site which is accessible below this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) S@@ FX@@ 200 I@@ infr@@ ar@@ ot@@ ape , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rec@@ tangle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the image .
below the preview you can set two parameters of film gran@@ ul@@ arity and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . add the option Add film gran@@ ul@@ arity when you want to simulate the gran@@ ular texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO controller alters the amount of film gran@@ ul@@ arity and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in transformation . green meadows are white as snow !
as the filter mixes color channels for re@@ producing infrared film , especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the color information is missing .
this is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photograph from New Zealand . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film has been set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values create a kind of aura in the advanced .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; filter film gran@@ ul@@ arity is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to reproduce film grains on your pictures . this is known from classical high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films , manufacturers mix large silver grains of photo emul@@ sion .
the film gra@@ dient effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back into the past . the treated image gets rid of a timeless ambi@@ ance detached from everyday life . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , road photograph , gran@@ ular sight especially in your mon@@ och@@ rome photos , you must use this filter .
with the controller , the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although frequently higher values are needed , set to ISO @-@ 24@@ 00 . if you need even more grains , you can apply the filter several times .
this is an example of the film gra@@ dient effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and this worked the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity conform to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting . nature pictures and still life are good for this effect .
there are two controls to influence this effect . the upper one sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thicker brushes are better suited for large images . fl@@ atten the smo@@ othing or , viewed from the other side , the char@@ ms .
this is an example of oil painting effect . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the comp@@ utation is marked with ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 pixels large image is 1 and smo@@ othing 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; filter char@@ coal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a cab@@ bage @-@ sketch . images whose gra@@ dients are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine which scene you would have chosen to outline yourself . these would be good pictures to start with .
there are two controllers with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper knob sel@@ ects the pen size and the lower adju@@ sts the contrast ( smooth@@ ness ) .
this is an example of the carbon capture filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the &amp; Edit filter en@@ grav@@ ings your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was st@@ amped in wax . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; Filter Gra@@ ph is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works especially well with pictures with a simple structure where color is not the most important of the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ strous landscape .
the depth allows adjusting the contrast of filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of distortion effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
shaft Part 1 : divi@@ des the image into cells and lets it look as if it is viewed through blocks of glass .
shaft 2 : analog to the shaft blocks 1 the image is distorted with another version of glass blocks .
some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time using the button Be@@ e .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of blur@@ ring effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom Out : blur@@ ring the image along star @-@ shaped lines that eman@@ ate from a center . this simul@@ ates blur@@ ring a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of often seen in sports photography .
radial blur@@ ring : blur@@ ring the image by turning the pixels around a center . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a rotating camera .
distance blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to step back into the background .
blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image through horizontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a moving linear moving , z : B : from a car or by train , camera .
blur@@ ring blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image smoothly into the dark and strongly in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and brilliant soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or adding a warm and subtle glow .
sharp@@ ness : blur@@ ring the image by chance shift of the pixels and simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of an arbitrary moving camera .
intelligent blur@@ ring : finds the color pool in the picture and wi@@ pes it without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : divi@@ des the photo into rectangular cells and then recre@@ ates it by filling with an average pixel value .
some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can cancel this calculation at any time with the button Be@@ aching .
the rain@@ drops are a nice little tool to make rain@@ drops on your image . this gives natural your pictures a wet look . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm .
drop@@ let size allows to change the size of drops . since the drop@@ let size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fish eyes change the optical effect of drops on the image .
you can choose with &amp; Edit ; image processing a range free of rain@@ drops . use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . if you then start the filter rain@@ drops the range will remain free of rain@@ drops .
this is an example of the rain@@ drop filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a calm sunset and the processed image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can get it by mirr@@ oring or turning it into the correct orientation . the tools for this can be found in the Transformation Tur@@ ning or Shift mirr@@ oring .
photo infl@@ ating is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality .
the big question is , how can you infl@@ ate a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom in an image when the limits of the resolution are reached ? how can you retrieve or guess the missing information ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm used here makes a good job here . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size , you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . select transformation size change in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is shown below .
change the tool to size uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approximate the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality then try the tool to infl@@ ate .
many image processing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. sp@@ line inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge a picture . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo infl@@ ated was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you have to tell the tool how to change the size . these settings are available in the New Size tab and are listed below :
keep aspect ratio : if this setting is enabled , the aspect ratio of the original image is maintained when entering the new size .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more is smooth@@ ed . this is necessary if there is a lot of noise , as it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect it must be set higher than 3 .
the Save as and Lo@@ ading buttons are used exactly for this purpose . enlarge Any setting for photo can be saved as a text file and later re@@ charged .
infl@@ ating photo is very fast with what it does , but it can take a long time and a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Be@@ e .
you can see below an example of photo infl@@ ating by enlar@@ ging a small paint image to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged image ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of the linear magni@@ fication for comparison .
the cutting of a photo is not only a frequently performed surgery , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to put a picture together . to cut a photo you need to create with the mouse just the rec@@ tangle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and drawing the rec@@ tangle . you will see this rec@@ tangle as you move the mouse .
when you release the mouse button again the area of the photo will be cut out . this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting . you can change the size of the area to be cut by drag@@ ging it at the corners of the rec@@ tangle . a new rec@@ tangle can be created by simply drag@@ ging it with the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the cut , use the button The C@@ trl + + X button in the toolbar and the photo is cut ( C@@ trl + + X ) . use the file Save or File Save as in the File menu to save the newly cro@@ pped photo .
in the preview window , you can change the size of the rec@@ tangle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio you have defined in the dialog remains intact .
in the tool according to aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as high @-@ format or landscape format . in portrait aspect , the greater value of the height and in the cross @-@ format of the width is assigned .
the tool according to aspect ratio makes use of a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimet@@ ers , inches or any other physical size . you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog , there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically .
at the bottom of the dialog you can set the range to the maximum possible depending on the selected ratio and orientation .
the tool according to aspect ratio will store its settings depending on the image orientation ( Horizon@@ tal or Ver@@ tical ) . if you use the cutting tool the next time , these settings are displayed in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data reflect the cro@@ pped image and not the original image .
the settings of the inter@@ connection help make it possible to hide help in order to better compose your images . these help are :
harmonious tri@@ angles are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third @-@ el@@ bows , harmonious tri@@ angles are a possibility to divide a rec@@ tangle in similar harmonious tri@@ angles on the diag@@ on@@ als .
golden middle : the golden middle is a division that refers to various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the leaves of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things that we perceive as beautiful .
the golden division is the irr@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks , which thus constructed your temples and pyr@@ ami@@ ds . artists and architects used the golden division in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos together to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number is derived from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i Episode 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . the resulting divi@@ der is 1 : 1.@@ 6@@ 18 the golden center . a composition that follows this rule is considered visually harmonious .
the gold center provides more liquid relief lines if you put together a picture . these aids are listed below :
the Golden spiral will bring you good results for your photos . compared to the third gel , the golden spiral generates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this kind of composition leads the gaze of the be@@ holder along the line of the spiral and creates a sym@@ metric visual flow on this way .
another rule is the rectang@@ les of the golden spiral , also called golden rectang@@ les . these rectang@@ les are used to create the golden spiral . this can be a line or different objects . this can simply be there without guiding the eye , it will fulfill its task .
the Golden Tri@@ angles also derive from the golden spiral mentioned above . their verti@@ ces are the central points of the sides of the golden rectang@@ les . note that in contrast to harmonious tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are not equal tri@@ angles . diagonal to these lines can be published a static object more dynamic .
when using golden tri@@ angles to break your frame you create an effect called dynamic symmet@@ ry . try to place your focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition which you cannot reach otherwise .
the horizontal mirrors and vertical mirrors can be used to mirror the harmonic divisions .
the color of the lines allows you to set the color of the lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the lines can be invisible . this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image .
the free rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle .
when you make a photo , it is easy to keep the camera horizontally or horizontally . this creates a picture in which things are rot@@ ated around an angle . this creates a picture in which things are rot@@ ated around an angle . you can do this with the &amp; digi@@ cam ; image editing and the tool free rotation repair . select transformation Free Rotation and adjust the target angle .
rotate your picture with the slide angle . the values on this sli@@ der are given in degrees . with the Pre@@ ferences button you can set the slide to 0 degree . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are shown on the right side .
for your help , the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse cursor in the image preview to position the two lines . after you have moved it over an important point of the image , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in the previous section .
after you have shot a picture you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to fix this is to use the function Transform@@ ers Cro@@ pping out of the image processing .
an elegant way to cut the image is the automatic cut function . select one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smooth@@ s the image a bit after turning . but notice the above warning .
all perspective transform@@ ations are performed by a fixed point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will then be automatically rec@@ al@@ cul@@ ated . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you change the perspective :
new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation in pixels .
new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation in pixels .
angle left : displays the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area .
angle right up : displays the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area .
angle at the bottom left : displays the current angle in degrees at the bottom left corner of the transformed area .
angle right down : displays the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed area .
after adjusting the perspective , the image becomes somewhat blur@@ red . for a single adjustment , this effect is small , but two adjustments generate a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you have adjusted the perspective you get unpleasant tri@@ angular holes at the corners . one way to clean it is to cut the picture with transform@@ ers trimm@@ ing out of the image processing .
the sh@@ earing tool is used to move part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction . for example , the upper part of the image is distorted to the right and the lower part to the left . this is no rotation , the image is distorted . in other words , a rec@@ tangle is transformed into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module via transformation scissors .
drag your picture by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle . if you press pres@@ ets , the angles are reset to zero . a preview of the effect will be shown to you and the new dimensions of the target image are shown to the right of the preview area .
to your help a vertical and a horizontal line are displayed . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the control tool to adjust your image .
after you have done the sc@@ aling , the image is wi@@ ped a bit . for a single sh@@ earing , this effect is usually negli@@ gible , but two notes generate twice as much blur@@ ry and therefore you should avoid this .
after the sc@@ aling , the image has tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to remove them is to cut the picture with transform@@ ers trimm@@ ing out of the image processing .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries were compiled . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ cam .
because of this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to find a list of all file formats available on your system . however , you will always find JPEG and TIFF among them .
&amp; Edit &gt; shows only files in formats that are familiar with . this is done using the file extension and comparing them with a predefined list . if the extension is listed in the list , &amp; Edit . you can change this list of file extensions which &amp; Edit . in the Configuration section , you will find more information .
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras even allow you to select the format you want to use . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression processes to digital images . redundant information is reduced in order to store image data in a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . generally , there are better , smo@@ other results than JPEG at the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also save loss@@ less when specified in the settings .
if you want to know more about the raw image format , you can read from Wikipedia , The LU@@ MIN@@ O@@ US Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful guides in English . you can convert raw format images to JPEG or TIFF with the image converter from &amp; digi@@ cam ; in the Configuration section , you will find further information on how to use modules with &amp; digi@@ cam ; .

many tools you need editing photo editing are included in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; your description follows here .
all image processing tools such as sharpen@@ ing , sof@@ t@@ mark , noise suppression , re@@ focusing , mas@@ king , &amp; etc ; . use a single dialog type that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you see &amp; quot ; texture applies quot ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter to the current image . left of it allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
the left pane shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected preview area .
horizontal divide without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper area shows the original and the bottom shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area .
the left pane shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
the upper section shows the original and the lower one for comparison the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ M@@ ouse over &apos; -@@ style : shows the preview when the mouse is not in preview and otherwise the original .

loading large graph@@ s ( currently there are problems starting from about 1000 knots and a h@@ ack to show more than these nodes )
further required software : &amp; k@@ alli@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program that pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graphi@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ Tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of graph@@ s . needed in detail :
the main window displays the opened graph , each in its own sub @-@ window . initially , if you start &amp; k@@ alli@@ graph@@ s ; without bo@@ oting an argument , the main window is empty as in the lower screen shot . in this case , the toolbar only contains the icon File Open and the ( empty ) list last opened files . click on the first icon to open the dialog file .
after you have selected one or more &amp; dot ; files , the main window looks like in the bottom screen@@ shot :
as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the drawing area . you can select a fixed position of this overview using the context menu or automatically select this position .
use the scroll wheel ( up and down without special buttons , left and right with pressed &amp; old ; button ) ;
zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by a factor 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
if the file currently loaded into &amp; k@@ m@@ viewer ; loaded file was modified by another program , the following window will appear :
you can choose whether the graph will be rel@@ o@@ aded or whether you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ alli@@ viewer ; can also mem@@ ori@@ ze your decision , so that later on . if you want to change your decision later , you can use the menu item Settings k@@ Graph@@ viewer ; set up ... use , see also .
if you want to open a graph file outside of a running &amp; c@@ Graphi@@ viewer ; instance open , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or at the command line , you have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; c@@ Graphi@@ viewer ; instance , or display the graph to be loaded in a sub@@ window of the current instance .
as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but change it with the setup dialog afterwards .
at program start , you can open all graph@@ s of your last session again . again , you can save your choice both as well as change later .
you can also specify how to split the graph to several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be selected freely .
when you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come to a page should be adjusted to this page . the aspect ratio is ignored . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled by the respective parts of the graph .
page preview with one on several pages without header and with another font
the Er@@ ne@@ ut Load site gives the ability to specify behavior when a file has been modified on the hard disk , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically rel@@ o@@ ad or ignore the changes ) or let the program ask for each time .
the Open site gives the possibility to specify the behavior of &amp; k@@ alli@@ graph@@ s ; specify a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub @-@ window of the current session ) or determine that every time it is requested .
the session management page provides the ability to specify the starting behavior of &amp; k@@ alli@@ graph@@ s ; you can set a default behavior ( open or not ) or specify a default behavior at each start .
the context menu , which usually appears at one click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; opens up additional possibilities :
here you can choose between different &amp; graphi@@ cally different layout algorithms . these entries , as described on the &amp; graphi@@ vi@@ z website , are :
&amp; dot ; algorithm , the standard for directed graph@@ s . it produces hierarch@@ ical or lay@@ ered graph@@ s of directed graph@@ s . the algorithm creates the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges as possible as few edge overl@@ aps as possible .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for un@@ executed graph@@ s . it produces represent@@ ations according to the spr@@ ing@@ spring model . the Kam@@ ada Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is equivalent to statistical multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm creates a spr@@ ing@@ spring model layout for un@@ executed graph@@ s . it uses the Fru@@ ity @-@ man @-@ pure gold he@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multi @-@ grid sol@@ ver for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graph@@ s .
the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm arran@@ ges the nodes circular according to the description of Six und Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain graph@@ s of multiple cycli@@ c structures .
open a dialog where you can specify a layout command that is then executed by a shell . the command should accept the graph@@ ene file as a parameter , and output the calculated layout of the graph@@ .@@ to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a layout command you can set &amp; eg ; den &amp; graphi@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ algorithms special options , or also change the graph with a filter before it is drawn .
determines the type of graph ( directed or un@@ executed ) and uses the standard algorithm for each type ( dot ; for directed , and ne@@ ato ; for un@@ executed graph@@ s ) .
if this setting is enabled , the overview will be displayed if necessary . otherwise it will not be displayed and the positioning menu is in@@ active .
shows the What is the mouse poin@@ ter . click on a &amp; GUI ; element to get more help with this element ( if any ) .

the K@@ IP@@ I module provides tools to read and save new images .
this module can be used to read and save new images from external sources . currently , two sources can be used :
scan images : uses the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner supported by the San@@ e project or another source such as Video Stre@@ ams . to make this work you need to have K@@ oo@@ ka and san@@ e installed .
when you are scanning the menu entry , a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer . select the source from which you want to get the image . you can also set the default source for the next time .
after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears by selecting the default duc@@ r@@ oth default values to select your image accordingly . see the preview and adjust the area to your needs before using the button scan the image . the estimated file size will be shown in the right , lower corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find more information .
make sure that the window will be displayed completely , as some settings might not be displayed .
after pressing the button scanning you have to wait until the scan is complete and the window to set the options of the target image appears . here you can specify the compression and type of image file . here you can specify the compression and type of image file . here you can specify the compression and type of image file . you also need to select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create the image to be saved .
screen@@ shots can be created after selecting the Import - &gt; screen shot from the menu . a window appears where you can set the different screen phot@@ om@@ o@@ di :
select the complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
when all your own program windows are selected , the calling program will disappear , so that you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , you will read the currently visible work@@ space . if you have selected the complete desktop , only the window under the mouse is read .
the delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts . if you need to switch to other areas of work , you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate there .
after the screen@@ shot has been taken , the dialog box will appear with the options described above .

if you select the option Change the size of the photos before up@@ loading , the photos are changed before up@@ loading in size . the size is taken from the value registered at Maximum Size .
the maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images . the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery export is a tool to export your picture collection to a gallery server .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Galerie @-@ Export has no documentation at present . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. attention : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . geographic data is stored in the EX@@ IF keywords of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization provides tools to locate pictures ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the spher@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , length and width are used .
to cor@@ relate your pictures with geographic data you need a GPS trace as XML file in the g@@ p@@ x format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical loc@@ alization Cor@@ relation . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS trace .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and go to the menu . the above @-@ looking dialog will then load . to get a possible correlation between time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a track file with GP@@ X file . of course , this file contains data that were recorded at the same places at the same time as the images of your camera .
when the file is loaded an automatic correlation is performed which indicates the coordinates in red . GPS trace data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera &apos;s time must be converted to GMT . this can be done using the time zone . set your camera line here .
the setting for the maximum time deviation indicates the upper deviation for the GPS time and camera . if the deviation is included , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you don &apos;t have track data from one place for pictures you can edit the g@@ p@@ x file manually and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will cor@@ relate all images in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ate and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have the right data . if you know that in reality there is a location in a great time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the button cor@@ relate to inter@@ pol@@ ate .
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful if you have made a number of photos at the same location . as the dialog opens the coordinates from a call to the next , you just need to use the OK button to set the data on the current photo .
the location can also be found and set with the shown map . select the respective region and enlarge it . always select it again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy . the map can always be selected manually . the map can be changed between map mode , satellite image and a mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are possibilities to attach the GPS data to the images . here is a small script used to provide a stack of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums to a picture gallery from HTML pages con@@ forming to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that are to be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded U@@ TF @-@ 8 to make the best possible internation@@ alization possible .
the tab has four tabs in which the settings can be adjusted . the tab selection allows you to select all the albums that are to be exported to HTML . you only need to select the albums on the right . in the area below you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below you will see the album preview and the text that appears in the header of the HTML page .
the tab design defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this tab is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . if you then click on a picture , a new page opens in which the image is displayed . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer , &amp; eg ; D@@ ick@@ show
the tab album defines the settings where and how the gallery is to be saved with all your associated images . select a folder on which you have write permission . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export which contains everything will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG File Format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images will also be saved in the new images .
with Other color depth you can change the default color depth . of course , this also influences the file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the thumb@@ nail images allow you to adjust some of the settings from the album tab for the thumb@@ nails , these are small images that are shown in the gallery .
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press Cancel to cancel the process .
when the module has created the pages , the window will not be automatically closed . you can therefore read the program messages to see if errors occur during creation . the web browser will automatically start at the end to preview the gallery . press C@@ lose to close the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL tool to view images .
the K@@ IP@@ I Viewer Viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations such as rot@@ ations , zo@@ oming or moving . the viewer can be used with short commands and folders . it has been developed for quick image display and quick access to its functions .
after the start , an image is displayed by default in full screen mode . this can be changed to a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ less Module is a tool to change images without compromising your quality .
this module allows to save images in JPEG format for the actions below , without the usual loss of quality or metadata .
the consequence of loss @-@ free storage is that the file size increases as no compression of the color information takes place . for example , this can also be found in PNG format .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is a tool to connect your computer to a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. attention : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module metadata editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the mail@@ ing@@ list k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the Import function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . select the image you want to copy in the main program and then go to the Import function . this will then open the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the image to which you want to copy the metadata . the data will be copied after you click the OK button .
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not write into any target format . JPEG is supported by writing . please refer to exi@@ v2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Enco@@ der Module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in form of a slide show .
the MPEG Enco@@ der module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video , with a defined length . this module uses the M@@ jp@@ eg@@ tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck packages . you can also insert an audio file in the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slideshow .
all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . additionally , you can select a background color for the slideshow . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD Player . to burn the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
first you have to select the images to be packed into the MPEG slide show . after that , you can create the module on Tools MPEG Di@@ ash@@ au .
the images you have selected are then listed under image files in the Portfolio . there you can also change the sorting of the images or the contents of the list .
after you are happy with your list , you should adjust the other settings . the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you are planning to play the file on a TV , you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pres@@ et and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds you indicate an image . the speed of the image transition is defined below . a low value creates very sudden , but a high , very smooth image change .
the background color can be set next . in case of doubt , you should let it black . in case of doubt , you can specify the name and path of the generated file under the name of the MPEG output file .
if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . after you have adjusted all settings to your preferences , you can use the button code to start generating the movie . depending on the speed of your computer , you can quickly or in all rest enjoy a cup of coffee and enjoy the slideshow when you are back .
if an indicator appears that enco@@ ders or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ jp@@ eg@@ tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck packages via the button settings to the right bottom .
the Print Ass@@ ist allows you to print several images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gim@@ p . for example , this is useful for you to improve or print directly with the Gim@@ p module .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format to one of three formats JPEG , TIFF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w of Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from Him is : do not expect from d@@ cra@@ w that it produces the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get with d@@ cra@@ w better results ! .
first select the RAW file to be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w image converter window appears in the mode for a single image . with the button Pre@@ view you can view the effect of your current settings on the image .
you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option determines whether the camera settings should be used for white balance . the main parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can further edit the image later .
a four @-@ color R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected so you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switch does not have any effect .
once you are satisfied with the preview , you can select one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the filen@@ ame stays the same and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a loss@@ less algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
the Tag@@ ged Image Format , TIFF , retains all information of your image and uses loss@@ less LZ@@ W compression .
if you plan to edit your images often or otherwise use it elsewhere you should not select the JPEG format as it only allows a limited number of operations before image quality deteri@@ or@@ ates . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you select JPEG as a storage format , the metadata that is contained in the RAW file will be stored in the JPEG file in the Ex@@ if information .
if you have adjusted your settings , you can start the conversion with the Exec@@ ute button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use Cancel .
batch editing mode allows you to convert several images at one time . use this mode if you are sure , e.g. by testing on a single image , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images . however , they have the possibility to over@@ write existing files . this is useful if they were created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion has progres@@ sed .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in one album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all pictures of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the start number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album .
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images from an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . you can zoom or enlarge the image . to do so , four types of image change are provided :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in one dimension . width or height of the image is selected automatically , depending on image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : res@@ izing in two dimensions . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to customize your image to the screen format .
non proportional : not proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
pre@@ press : prepares the image for the photo printing . the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , edge size and background color , will be adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before . further images can be drag@@ ged onto the list of images to be sent and stored there .
after you have started the module , the image window will display the images you have selected . you can add more images using a file selection dialog . for the last selected image , a preview will be displayed on the right .
you can also drag and drop images to the image list to add the list of images to be sent .
with the button Remove images , the selected images are removed from the list of images to be sent .
after you have selected all the images , you can use the OK button to open the new message window of your e @-@ mail client . you just have to add the addresses and the subject . the images you have selected are attached as attachments .
most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations on the size of e @-@ mails sent . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures .
the E @-@ Mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is saved and used every time you change it .
select your email client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you will need to specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below .
if you are using the Google Mail service , you must first install the G@@ mail Agent on your computer . you can download it here .
after selecting comments in an attached file , the comments are added to the images in a text file and attached to the mail .
the PNG format below the File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to loss@@ less formats such as TIFF . you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise , we recommend you to format JPEG format .
if you select JPEG in file format and the original files are in JPEG format , then the original Ex@@ i@@ f@@ dates will be added to the images to be sent .
when the process is finished , the window will not be closed automatically so you can view the status messages , on the search for errors . however , your e @-@ mail program will automatically start at the end . by closing the button you can lock this window .
after starting the module Advanced Sli@@ deshow , a window will appear with questions like you want to show your slideshow . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album .
using Open@@ GL passes in the presentation activates very elegant image transitions by means of Open@@ GL . however , you must have a corresponding graphic card , as otherwise the slideshow will be very slow .
the File View option ensures that the filen@@ ame of the images is displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation .
the Loop option allows the presentation to be displayed in a loop . you can then manually inter@@ rupt it with Es@@ c .
the option to select pictures random@@ ly ensures that the images are displayed in a random order . thus , the order of the images is not used in the album .
the temporal distance between the images can be set between the images . 1500 milli@@ seconds corresponds to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . so , the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transition effect . so you should test this before you show your friends &apos; presentation !
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose . random@@ ly , each transition between the images sel@@ ects a different effect .
during slideshow you can access a toolbar at the top left edge of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn on .
with this toolbar you can pause and restart the presentation , jump to the previous and next image and stop the slide show .
at the bottom of the screen you can see the current filen@@ ame , position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. attention : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to set a picture as a background image for the work surface .
this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected sub@@ menu option , as background for your K@@ DE work surface .
once you have provided your pictures and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations , you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; browse through these browsers , see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the image , there are now entries in each group , i.e. in persons , places and in the group keywords .
in the browser window you will see the categories for which you have entered information as you have provided your pictures and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations . additionally there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course view the current thumb@@ nails .
when you press the mouse on the entry , the view of the browser changes . see picture .
if you select another person only the images displayed on which both persons can be seen . by this selection method you can restrict the number of images displayed by a few thousand images to a few individual images .
if you have selected all persons , places and other settings , you can display thumb@@ nails to view the images of your sphere of activity .
in the picture each person has the same symbol in front of her name . you can save with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person to store their own thumb@@ nail , that is of course also valid for places , keywords and other categories you have defined yourself . see also the picture .
to view images next to the names , select the button located on the right outside of the toolbar . in the appearing context menu , you can select which view you want to use for each category . this has the advantage that you can display icons with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you don &apos;t have any suitable images for your keywords ) .
however , you have to define yourself which image should be displayed for each individual person . to do this , you need to open the image view window ( described in more detail ) and select the image for the corresponding person in the context menu . in the View window , you can customize the image for the corresponding person . in the View window , you can adjust the magni@@ fication factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image should be displayed or cut off .
when you enter the search dialog in the main window , a dialog is displayed , which is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties . you can view this dialog at once .
if you enter a string in the lab@@ eling or description field , you can also enter a date to search for . if you want , you can also enter a date to search for ; the date can be either a part of the total date , i.e. 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two dates , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the lower part of the window , you can browse all images by certain names as you can see in the picture . here is illustrated by images on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene .
this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; . if you do not like to read manuals , but rather want to try some features , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and check out the quick entry , the screen@@ shots and the introduction videos .
start &amp; k@@ screen album ; and in the first dialog , select the demo , if you want &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start for the first time , or select the menu entry k@@ photo@@ album ; demo . then some sample images are loaded and you can use the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; try .
if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a con@@ ti@@ gu@@ ous HTML document to download .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar can be seen here : . as the name suggests , this bar displays you date statistics about the images in your database .
the tim@@ eline can show you several different time units . each bar then displays another unit . you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the bar only 10 minutes sections .
the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can change the displayed entries Pre@@ view view from the database ( if you select a date , the first image of this date is displayed in the preview pane ) and the tim@@ eline always displays the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in the preview pane .
you can also select a section of the tim@@ eline by holding down the mouse button and drag@@ ging the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , so the time data . if you select a range , you will be shown in the preview view only images of this time period . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the tim@@ eline .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; provides you two ways to create HTML websites with your pictures . one is integrated in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other available as module ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual , the integrated version is described which you can create through the File HTML menu ...
before creating HTML pages you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas Content , Layout and Go@@ al . in the following each area is described more precisely .
first , enter the title of the title and a description which the HTML file should contain later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML @-@ example pages see an example of these settings .
next select whether a &amp; desktop album ; export file is to be created which is to be seen on the overview page . next information about the export files can be found in .
finally , you can select which information to be displayed on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid displaying information that is obvious to the viewer without any description . note that all images are displayed by a party . note that all images are exported from a party .
in this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are unique , which is why this is not specifically dealt with .
at the bottom of the page you can set up various resolutions for the images . thus , those who view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 do not have images that have a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewers of your site can change the resolution at any time . so , it can browse your images with low resolution , which leads to a lower transmission time . if it wants to get a larger image , it changes to a higher resolution .
in this settings area , place the different folders and the URL where your website is stored .
the best way to select a base folder for all your HTML files and create a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set .
first you need to select the main folder where all your images will be saved . this folder will be saved and automatically added next time . this allows you to select either a folder or a K@@ DE supported protocol , for example :
after you have created your images , you can check if they are really all visible to viewers . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser will be launched after the pages are created . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder , you will need to manually copy them to it . in order for the import function , see , correctly , you need to specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder where all sub@@ folders are located .
the settings you just described have moved all three to base folders and URLs . in this folder a sub@@ folder will be created , whose name you specify in the output folder .
if you are on a family party , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; coming together , you might want to share your pictures with them . however , if you have spent a lot of time using the image information , people on the pictures , recording location , etc . , then you need to do with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do not do this work again .
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database . the image properties are exported with ex@@ - and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external ones . they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or if the file is only a short@@ cut to pictures . the advantage of storing all images in the file is that you have all the pictures together and that you can distribute this file so independently . however , the obvious disadvantage is the file size .
you can either export a .@@ k@@ im file directly from the File menu ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images twice . first , it searches the images that are in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file . if the corresponding images are not found , then the images of the URL you specified when creating the HTML files are scanned . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML export .
below is a dialog for ex@@ porting images that you can click through the Export ... menu .
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three options are available :
with the manual copy option to the .@@ k@@ im file , you have to copy the images in the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the Automati@@ cally Copy to the .@@ k@@ im file copy &amp; k@@ screen album ; the images automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . since most images have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small it is usually not worth comp@@ ressing the files . if you want to do so , simply select the Export file option .
the last option of this page is to limit the size of the picture . if you send pictures to your friends , you might not want to send them in full size , because the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very large . for example , you can limit the size by saying that each image should be maximum 800 pixels high and wide .
if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File menu file ... select , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; import the exported database as described in described .
the Import Assistant consists of four steps . first you need to select which images you want to import , then in which folder the import images should be copied .
it may be that you specify the category persons of the file to be imported ( if you are a domain ) , while this category stands in your database . therefore , in the third dialog box , you will be asked which categories of the file to be imported and what categories they are in your database .
in the fourth step you can compare the categories of the file to be imported using the categories of your current database . for example , see the image .
it must be easy to browse and view images : if you look at pictures , you often want to jump within different picture groups &amp; m@@ das@@ h ; if you see for example pictures of your Italy vacation and discover a picture with your friend on it , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted .
in this manual , you will go through the various steps of ( 1 ) setting the information about your images , via ( 2 ) browsing and viewing , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and custom@@ ization options .
K@@ Photo@@ Album has been started as a program for managing your images , but it has been expanded and today it also takes care of your videos . many places in this manual are talked about images , but frequently this includes videos with one .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; stores all its information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the top folder of your images . this is a simple XML file that you can use with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , copy to a floppy or re@@ visions in CVS where you want them .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; re@@ members the folder where your images are stored and automatically re@@ stores it in future starts . if you want to read another database in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , you can start another folder tree with pictures , you can start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; with the -@@ c option . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / Company / Pictures / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
over the menu entry Settings k@@ photo@@ album ; set up ... go to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual you will explain the different settings .
on the left you can see six different symbols that allow you to view the settings of the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available , which you can access the F1 key by pressing a button and a click on the desired option .
it describes how you can define different properties for each image , e.g. persons , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums .
see the dialog which is used to edit existing groups . for each existing group , you can select a label and a symbol .
in the section sub@@ categories have already been mentioned . in the Options dialog you can set up complete members groups , i.e. all members of a group at once in a group , instead of all groups of a member as explained in .
in the left half of the window you can select the category you want to configure . in the left half of the window there is a list of the current categories and in the right a list of sub@@ categories .
&amp; k@@ screen album ; divi@@ des its modular system with other graphic applications , such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; image plugin interface .
the modules can and are not described in this manual as they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , most modules have a help page that you can access through the modules themselves .
since the modules are shared among each other by several applications , it may be that the modules were tested with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; only very little have been tested . therefore , you should always test new modules with the demo database first before you apply it to your own images using the &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ demo &lt; user@@ input \ &gt; or using the Help menu . don &apos;t say I didn &apos;t warn you !
the applications that the modules use together with K@@ IP@@ I are very different , whereby it may be that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do not work . this is the disadvantage if you share functions with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I is that the other applications associate their images into albums : this is an album simply a folder . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this kind of order is not supported , it simul@@ ates order after albums for some modules to make use of the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album .
this simul@@ ates &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which simply corresponds to the current view , so all the images that show you the picture preview at the moment .
next to the current album , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , the modules also have to give a list of albums . here goes &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as follows :
if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s Browser shows the content of a category , for example all persons , then each entry in this category represents an album for the module .
or it will use the category you specified in the Settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . so , for example , if you are using the category persons , the &amp; k@@ photo@@ album will do so , so whether you selected people to view and pass it on to the module .
since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . to do so , start the settings dialog and select the modules to load modules .
on the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are used to it from any other K@@ DE application , see the top of a menu and toolbar . under the toolbar , you will see the window that you can browse your image database . in the section we will return to this window , but now click on the entry View images showing you an overview of all available images .
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to provide any picture with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this includes information about the people who are on the picture , where the image was taken , etc . you can use each image individually or for a larger number of pictures simultaneously . if , for example , on all pictures Jes@@ per is pic@@ tured and all pictures taken in Copenhagen .
all these comments can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section . if you want , you can see those comments when using the built @-@ in viewer .
you can see three lists with a text box by setting people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; because you will always use them again when you enter information about your images .
the following idea is to de@@ fer the images within the list : for example , if you have a family celebration and are shown on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 people , you can , so that the names used are shifted upward , to find and assign the people faster .
if you prefer to receive an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the Sor@@ ting icon on date under the list .
if you have selected comments for each image individually , you may want to edit all the selected images and add ann@@ ot@@ ations to them . in this case , simply click on the before and back buttons , which are located below the thumb@@ nail of the image to the right .
if you have recorded several images , e.g. with the same person , it may be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item Sever@@ al entries at once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA . San Francisco and Los Angeles are also located in California .
on the picture you see a browser window that shows the USA as a sub@@ group . to show you that it is a sub@@ group , a special icon is displayed .
in the context menu of the comment dialog it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new sub@@ category . in addition , you can also simply drag an entry to a category and place it in order to make it an sub@@ category of this entry . attention , this requires you to sort your categories alphabe@@ tically .
you can move the single items of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the bar which form the top edge of the frame . you can also make a separate window from a frame by drag@@ ging it outside the pane .
if you have adjusted the appearance of the window to your needs so that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the Options ... button to allow you , among other things , the possibility to save the current layout and appearance of the window .
you can also completely hide a frame . if you want to get this window again later , use the Options button ... and click / hide window here . see this process in the picture .
when you select the entry View ima@@ gery in your browser , you will get an overview with thumb@@ nails of the currently selected images , or all images if you do not have a filter . you can configure the size of thumb@@ nails by simply drag@@ ging the mouse with the middle mouse button .
if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image will be set as a background image for your desktop .
if you click on a picture , it will appear in the picture viewer . if you don &apos;t have a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete images in the image preview . simply select the appropriate images from which you want to delete and press either the Remove button or select Edit menu from the Edit menu . now , the window will be displayed , which you can see in the image .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; provides you with a solution for this problem . you can use with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; namely , images even without having stored on your hard drive . of course , you need to have the images stored somewhere so that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can see the view from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all necessary images can be loaded from the hard drive .
images , where the right upper corner is cut off , are not stored on the hard disk . for example , see the images 1 @-@ 9 . for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 , however , the thumb@@ nails are present , so that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album can show you the preview of these images . however , you can &apos;t view these images with the picture viewer .
as you see , this function requires you to copy files out of the folders and then copy it back . so if you want to avoid annoying , such as the mess@@ ing of your images , please purchase a larger hard drive to save all images .
in the menu images you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want a little more privacy , filter the images in such a way that at the end those who want to make you in@@ accessible to others and click on current view lock in the menu Privacy . alternatively , you can also choose all the images that your little sister is allowed to see , and choose the menu entry All except up @-@ to @-@ date view .
this allows you to specify which images should be hidden in the case of your little sister . if you want to give the laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu entry to lock images , thus removing all the images you have locked . if you want to get the pictures again , click on lock .
it is also possible to set a password which must be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply select Password in the Privacy menu .
please keep in mind that this image protection is by no means very secure . on the one hand , all the images on the hard drive and to the other , anyone who can access the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml can read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this kind of password protection only serves to ward off the view to private pictures .
the reason you want to spend all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours over hours with it is natural that you want to consider them some@@ time . for this reason , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; on a picture _ and video viewer . you can launch it from the preview as described in .
the viewer can see you . of course , it shows the image , but additional all the information you have entered about the image , such as who is on the picture , when and where it was made , etc .
if the info box on the upper part of the image you want to see , you can simply drag it with the mouse and disc@@ ard anywhere else . you can also configure which information is displayed and whether any information should be displayed . all of these options are available after a right @-@ click on the viewer . the then appearing context menu can be seen below .
some words in the info box are under@@ lined . if you click here the browser , see , appropriate entries to this display . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all images of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had selected people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have loaded multiple images in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the image image high and down . you can jump to the first and last image with Pos@@ 1 and end . these functions can also be reached from the context menu .
if several images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as slides . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then load a new image after a few seconds . how often it loads a new image can be checked by pressing the C@@ trl key and plus or minus .
a very useful feature of the viewer from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is it able to switch to full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the complete space on the screen . simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back .
when you use the viewer you can move into the image and zoom out . to zoom in , you can simply draw a rec@@ tangle with the mouse . with the minus key , you can zoom out again . the plus button zo@@ oms in the middle of the image . shows how a zoom area is selected and shows the result of the zo@@ oms .
with the point button you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ omed . with the power button sets the zoom , so that every pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image .
note that the only zoom operations work on videos that are in and out with the plus and minus key .
with the functions from the context menu , you can rotate the image . this does not work with videos . you can make comments to the current image using the menu item ann@@ ot@@ ations from the context menu .
if you look at images it may happen that you find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to set on the image . at the moment you can preview the image and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter this name . but you may prefer to select only the image and look at other images .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper . to see which photos you want you can launch the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad as you look one by one .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to paint pictures with features while you view them . features are the letters A to Z and you can make a feature by pressing the corresponding letters . in this you see a picture where the characters A , B and C are set .
once you have set features on your images , you can see them in your browser . so , if you have all the images you edit , print or whatever you have selected , then you can simply add all the images at once with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this is described in detail . after that you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do .
categories and special features can be displayed in preview screen . if you view categories in particular preview screen , then you can add characters to the images by simply pressing the letter for the attribute after the image has been selected . you can see this here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . in this case , you are allowed to paint on the picture .
the batch is not saved with the image , but in the database . in this way you can und@@ o your painted later .
in order to see the painting mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; switch on the image from the context menu . to termin@@ ate the painting , simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you need to use the application of the program &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; not fully master , but the documentation to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; should you have absolutely read and understood .
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and displayed the object in the wire mod@@ ell@@ - views yellow .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time . but not the object of an already selected object , since all objects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object into the object tree , select the position you want to insert the object and click either the icon in the toolbar or select a menu item in the In@@ sert menu .
if there are several possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu will be displayed to enable you to select the correct position :
by del@@ eting either from the menu bar under Edit or from the right mouse button context menu , you can remove selected objects from the scene .
if you have changed attributes , click Apply to Apply this Chan@@ ges . if you entered invalid values , a message will appear with a fault description . then you can correct the input errors and click Apply or reject the changes with Cancel .
if you enter the path to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; -@@ User documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation .
when you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview in the property view .
press ahead in the property view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture . as a default , the entire texture is rendered , even if you want to render a part of the texture ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , cross local .
the screen shot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is selected , the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by drag@@ ging with the mouse within the entire window .
each object has a stage of view as a wire model . you can indicate this value relative to the level of view of the super@@ ordin@@ ate object or as absolute value . objects are only displayed if they are selected or their view level is smaller or equal to the Visi@@ bility level of the scene selected in the toolbar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical view@@ points on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the standard window ordering or if you need a different arrangement , you can set it as desired . you can also store multiple window orders and switch between different arrangements .
to anchor a window over or below a view , drag the beginner to the top or bottom of a view . a rec@@ tangle then displays the new position .
to create a new column , drag the beginner to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anch@@ ored on the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height .
if you want to arrange multiple views on top of each other , drag the beginner in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the tabs at the top of the views .
the last possible window arrangement are floating views : views which are not anch@@ ored in the main window . to solve a view from the anch@@ or@@ age , drag the beginner to the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing left above in the beginning strip .
to close a view , click on the small cross at the beginning strip . to prevent closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross .
you can add additional views to the main window . in the View menu , you will find entries for each type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them at any location .
the current window view can be saved with View Window order ... Save . a dialog appears where you can save the window order under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene , you can render them . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g to render , this program must be properly installed . as this manual was written , &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 currently . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 .
to ren@@ ame the current scene , click the Ren@@ dering icon in the toolbar or select the menu item View scene ren@@ ders .
a render mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and the quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert any number of render modes , from a quick preview to full pictures of the highest quality .
if you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar or View R@@ ender modes in the View menu , the following dialog will be opened :
each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it makes sense to specify the properties of the mode .
in the box size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to render only a small area of the image , select the check box sub@@ section and enter the image section for rendering in the input fields .
in the combination field quality you can select the properties , the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; used for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ use reflection lighting . a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the user manual to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; .
when a picture is rendered with only a ray per pixel , various errors can occur . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ é pattern or step effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than one pixel in the image . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to decrease the influence of these errors . generally , pictures with this feature look better .
if you switch on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , compu@@ te and connect &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; more than a beam per pixel . this technique is super @-@ sampling .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as standard is an adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adaptive because the super @-@ sampling describes the neighbouring pixels . the second method is adaptive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sively because each pixel is continuously divided and adapted because the recur@@ sion depth depends on the calculated color values .
if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray tracks a beam per pixel . if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels exceeds the specified threshold , then both pixels will be calculated by the tracking of a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you set the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated , with a depth value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : r 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference then is :
diff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 beams per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels , which are trac@@ ed separately and tested for further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be set with the depth value .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the generation of noise for the beam process called J@@ it@@ tering . if you switch to J@@ it@@ tering , change &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the rays get a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last adjustment for the quality of rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; that calcul@@ ates diff@@ use light reflection . it takes a very long time to calculate a scene with this property .
on this map you can specify whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent if the associated rays have not hit the object .
opens a new window for displaying &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly quit , you can find the reason here .
to import a &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; import the menu item File Import ... and select a file in the dialog box .
currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not yet the full command set of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; if error messages or warnings occur when im@@ porting , a dialog box displays a list of all messages .
if you do not support source text in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import this source text between the two special comments / / * PM@@ R@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ R@@ w@@ end .
you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; this adds the source code of the object into the opened text file in the editor . to import objects to the scene , simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree .
with copy and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can insert source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
if you click help in the property view , open &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; user documentation to the displayed object . insert here the path to your document and the version . the versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 will be supported .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; searches for external files ( e.g. al@@ timeter information ) in the paths to the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the directory of the scene , you must also enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying the selected control points .
the color of the rec@@ tangle for the field of view in camera view and window type plates .
you can set the object catch of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rotation .
larger values result in a more accurate wire model and therefore a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time for rendering . for some objects such as the ball , you can set the level of detail separately for two directions .
when you cross high detail fi@@ del@@ ity for advanced projections , all wire model views are further divided when the camera uses an extended projection . advanced projections are all projections with exceptions of perspective and vertical projections . this feature results in a better approach for projections , but requires more time for rendering .
when you view the wall , a wall behind the objects is rendered . the wall is represented in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colours .
when you view the floor , a floor below the objects is rendered . the floor is represented in a chess board pattern consisting of two adjustable colours .
when you check box smo@@ othing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . the values for depth and threshold value can be set . exact information about parameters can be found in the R@@ ender modes section .
on this page you can change existing window orders or create new window orders . in the section of window orders , it explains how to create and save window orders .
drop down sel@@ ector standard window arrangement : displays all existing window orders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the selected window order at the start of the program .
the list of existing window orders shows all existing window orders . a new arrangement can be created using the Add button and del@@ eting a selected arrangement with the button Remove .
each window ordering is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list under the name shows all the views for the selected window arrangement . new views can be created using the button Add and Del@@ ete selected views with the button Remove .
the position of the new window . with Neue Clear you create a new column on the right @-@ hand side of the existing windows , with we@@ eds you anchor the window under the existing window , with tab card you get a card map view together with the previous view and flo@@ ats the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you just have &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start without more accurate knowledge of both programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a ball on a plane .
but you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that as a result you only get a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules :
if you don &apos;t set a camera , no rules can be applied for rendering , as a result you get a black picture .
if you do not insert light sources , your entire scene is in the dark and you only get a black picture .
if you have installed everything error @-@ free , see the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following default window ordering :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the icons of the toolbar . please read the documentation so you can get an adequate idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will often have to use these menus and symbols , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you first need to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the menu item Edit Del@@ ete . so you now have a scene without objects .
the wire model view shows how the camera looks at the whole scene you create . in particular , you will notice this in the fourth wire model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the perspective of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you will see the content of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; see more details .
do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera has control points to change the target point of the camera . just click on a control point with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired place .
when you press the Apply button or the Enter key , the wire model views and the object tree will change immediately according to these settings . as a result , you will see the scene from the view of the camera .
there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . you could , for example , insert a header ( insert Fin@@ ite body Qu@@ ader ) and the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a cum@@ ber@@ some method to solve this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; in fact provides a simpler way . you can use an infinite plane as floor :
a good advice : choose the plain in the object tree , change the name and then press the Apply button or enter the Enter key . in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately .
the wire model view now also displays the level , al@@ beit at the moment only as a fin@@ ite level . if you render the scene , the plane expands to the horizon .
if you look at the object tree carefully , you will find that you can fold the entry for the floor if you click on the item + in front of the object . in this case you will only see the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation , and shift . select one of these options , also change the possible settings in the view of the object properties .
in this scene you should move the floor to the exercise a unit under the horizontal line , only to get to know some of these parameters . select Shift and set the values as follows :
first select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but at the moment , choose something simple .
in both cases , a dialog box opens , in which you can select how to insert the object . please select First object . you can change the name in the property view ( name = ground pigment ) , with a click on the button preview you will see how the pigment looks now .
of course the preview of the pigment is just a matte black material because you still need to enter settings for the pigment . always remember that you can check the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview . also , there are many possibilities again , but take the easiest now .
if you do not see any color on the header and sphere , click on the Apply button and then preview .
the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you render your image now with a click on the icon , you should get the following result :
in the color list you have to enter two new attributes , called one @-@ colored . in the object tree you have to enter two new attributes , called one @-@ colored . then edit this entry twice ( you can also do this more frequently , but the board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
in the object tree , select the object tree each time and change the colors in the view of the properties :
this step you should be able to do as you have understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you should have understood it just as easy as the floor :
in view of the object properties , you can instantly change the settings . set the value for the radius : to 1 ( do not forget to press the enter key or the button Apply ) , so the ball has contact with the ground . otherwise , the ball would float above the ground as you have moved the ground around one unit down@@ wards .
of course the rendering now results in a strange result : as you can see before , the ball surface appears like a matte black material . in the following step , put a suitable material .
if you have chosen the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as already on the floor , give the ball a pigment as color :
select First Sub@@ ject and change the name for example in sphere Pig@@ ment . click on sphere pigment , then select one color and set the values as follows :
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish properties :
then change the values as in the following screen@@ shots and click Apply or press the Enter key .
the gl@@ itter effect and reflection result in some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrom@@ ed surfaces , even if metallic : not yet selected :
you should now have a good impression of the possibilities offered by you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; hopefully you have learnt so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ cing is a render method to generate a two dimensional picture of a three dimensional scene or a model .
when you trace a scene ra@@ y@@ trac@@ en , the ren@@ derer shoots hypo@@ the@@ tical beams from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene . the render calcul@@ ates how this ray effects through the objects and impacts atmospheric effects such as fog . thus , the scene pixel is processed for pixels .
as you can imagine , you won &apos;t see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you view the scene . without a light source you also don &apos;t see anything , the picture is simply black . obviously , every scene needs to be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . Po@@ v@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the default file dialog , you can select a file that you created previously with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it will be saved under the same name . if it is a new file , you must enter a name and a memory space .
re@@ stores the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage have been dis@@ car@@ ded .
this menu entry can only be selected if you have not saved any saved changes in the scene .
repeat the recently revers@@ ed command . you can only select this menu item if you have not used the Edit menu .
stores the current window arrangement and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new order or over@@ write an existing order .
in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the look , keyboard short@@ cuts and the default behavior .
opens a dialog to change the short@@ cut keys . you can use this option to set default short@@ cuts for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; modify commands or add new ones .
opens a dialog to set up the toolbar . you can use this option to add and remove tool@@ boxes for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er .
a b@@ ump map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to individually shape any b@@ ump on the surface and without changing the geometric shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for a b@@ ump map as well as a texture map .
basic objects are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic look .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel basis by applying an image file as a color card .
&amp; ball show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser where you can select images for viewing .
images can either be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ball show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can use by clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the Return key .
you can adjust if any image should be displayed in your own window , or if all images should always use the same window .
if you are looking for a specific file type , simply type the first character of the file name in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the lower right corner . if a matching file name has been found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in the dialogue setting - &amp; ball show ; there are five cards . in three of them , General and editing and slide show , you can set the mode of operation of &amp; ball show ; in the two other , short commands for the display window and short instructions for the browser , the keyboard short@@ cuts can be specified for the respective windows .
if this is selected , the images will be opened in full screen mode . if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area will be filled with the background color you can set down below . default is not full screen mode .
is this point enabled , loads &amp; ball show ; already the next image in the folder while you are still looking at the current image . this reduces the delay if you select the next image , and is particularly suitable for a slideshow .
with this option stores &amp; ball show ; when entering the name of the last opened folder . at the next start opens &amp; ball show ; this folder in the browser window .
click on the colored bar to select a background color . it is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if the window is larger than the image , the background will be filled with the selected color .
you can set &amp; ball show ; set up that only some of the file types can be displayed , which can also display the program .
this option increases the display window to the full screen for large images . this option is turned on as default .
specifies whether the slide show will start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the sli@@ der or the small arrows to the right of the input field . the default is 3 seconds .
if this value is set to 0 , the slide show will be repeated until it is abor@@ ted by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the sli@@ der or the small arrows to the right of the input field . default is 1 .
change the keyboard short@@ cuts for the different operating modes of &amp; ball show ; in the box maps , short instructions for the display window and short instructions for the browser .
with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ piece view of the fil@@ esystem with folders and files in a window .
shows large icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
displays preview images for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
shr@@ inks the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .

the best way to join &amp; show foto ; to participate is to join the developer mailing list . instruction to join the developer mailing list by &amp; show@@ screen@@ .@@ .
the show@@ screen@@ shot ; tries to give you so much control over its work processes as possible . there are many options that change the behavior of &amp; show screen@@ shots . to access these settings , you need to set the show@@ screen@@ shot in the Settings menu . the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these by clicking on the icons of the left @-@ hand side .
in the area of exposure indicators , you can select the color that is displayed when the under@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator was selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity should be in contrast to the colors with what you want to display . under@@ exposure should indicate a light color and over@@ exposure a dark color .
the main window of &amp; show@@ shot ; has a side@@ bar at the right edge , which provides important information and actions to the selected images . you can also find the same page bar in image editing . you can view it by clicking on one of the five tabs :
&amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; is an application to scan images that no longer makes them scan and save images .
&amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application to scan images that no longer makes them scan and save images . &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; for each image , open a dialog for saving or save the images instantly in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format . the user can also display the images before storing .
you can check the status of your scanner support on the SA@@ NE project page by entering the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line from &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; using the command Chann@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner cannot be opened or if no standard scanner is specified , then a dialog for selecting the scanner is opened .
the user can select the scanner you want to use and press OK to open the scanner . Cancel is &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; exit .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; chant ; ( lib@@ ks@@ anen ) doesn &apos;t treat these options very much .
to scan an image , the user can only start a pre @-@ scan and then scan the scanning range for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button .
to better select the image , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . he can also set the zoom in such a way that the complete preview fits into the window .
when the image has been selected , the final image can be read with the scan button .
when you preview a preview in the settings , the image will appear in a preview window as shown below . when saving is pressed , then the image will be saved and Sch@@ lie ? en will lead to a demoli@@ tion and you will get back to the main window .
the Settings button opens the dialog with the same name in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can view the image if desired before saving . in this case , the option must be selected before saving a preview . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be selected .
this setting allows you to select the way &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; open pictures . open dialog to Save for each image opens the dialog in front of each scanned image . if &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; this will automatically save it with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you need to select Save without asking for a filen@@ ame .
this setting defines where the images are stored in the Save without after a file name . if the images are stored after each scan , then this folder will be used as default for the dialog to save . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ... .
this parameter defines a picture pre@@ fix for the automatically to save images and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog to save . the automatically saved image gets a num@@ eric suff@@ ix that each time a picture is stored . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
the user can adjust the image quality used for saving . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if select the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the Help button starts the K@@ DE help with the &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the button above starts the K@@ DE over dialog for &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; . the Settings button shows the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to termin@@ ate &amp; chant .

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; used like all other programs keyboard short@@ cuts . below you will find a list of these short@@ cuts and their function . the global keyboard short@@ cuts can be set up by clicking the right mouse button in the player window and setting up global keyboard short@@ cuts . by clicking the right mouse button in the player window , you can set short@@ cuts ... Select .
you may set up existing multimedia keys in such a way that they function as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; short@@ cuts work . this will make your keyboard the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center .
the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many common functions , mostly found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browser , player , playlist , playlist browsers and scripts . an example call for the D@@ CO@@ P function pause could be &amp; z@@ b ; look like this :
Amar@@ ok supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; in addition , Amar@@ ok has some command line options .
you should give the user feedback when the script cannot be executed because of a lack of dependen@@ cy . please check in your script to see if all required modules are present and use k@@ dialog so that the user knows why a script does not run .
begin require &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bin@@ dings for ruby ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings v@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit
in scripts / templates you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply add them to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively easy .
with the help of D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command , which should be included in each K@@ DE installation .
most script languages make it possible to execute external programs and commands . this usually uses the ex@@ ec ( ) function . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here &apos;s an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends al@@ erts to all running scripts . for this purpose strings are written to the default execution of the script . for this reason , scripts should constantly monitor their default input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script can also ignore events if there is no use for it .
configure Wei@@ st the script to display the setup dialog . to store and load the set @-@ up data , each script itself must take care of . when a script is started , Amar@@ ok places the working folder on the folder where all data should be stored .
track@@ Change sign@@ alizes that a new piece is all@@ u@@ ded . the script could now ask for more information about the new piece using D@@ CO@@ P functions ( for example metadata or unit length ) .
Volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ Volume signals a change in volume . the new volume is an integ@@ er between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le Tra@@ ces the path to the selected playlist files when a user defined menu entry is cli@@ cked . sub@@ menu and it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le will also be passed to allow the script to re@@ v the cli@@ cked entry . to remove an entry , you can use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Item ( Sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) .
before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; finished , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed , e.g. , storing data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks script management can also install script packages that the user has downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) , which can optionally also be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) . we recommend an archive name such as vo@@ skri@@ p@@ t.@@ amar@@ ok@@ scrip@@ t.@@ tar@@ .@@ bz@@ 2 so that the user can clearly recognize the archive as a Amar@@ ok script package .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the ex@@ porting cat@@ amar@@ oc@@ script . for this reason you should ren@@ ame your script packages correctly .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to obtain the file permissions :
when your script package is ready , you can hang it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the Wi@@ ki Skri@@ ll page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for your entry in k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the Amar@@ ok . script .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful functions and is surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can simply drag music into the playlist rather than having to browse through endless menus . maybe you &apos;re just looking for a very specific title from thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s Coll@@ ecting Browser and Quick Search , you will find the piece within seconds .
you may have a number of play@@ lists , but you can never decide which you want to hear ? then the playlist browser is just the right thing for you . and if the decision is still hard , the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists will automatically select the right music according to certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok has excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers i@@ f@@ p and many generic USB devices . besides , many different audio systems can be used so you can choose how to listen to your music . these and many other useful functions make Amar@@ ok the most advanced audio player . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right thing to re@@ discover your music !
usually , in the base folder of the Amar@@ ok source you have to enter the following to compile and install Amar@@ ok :
da &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should not have any problems when comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report them to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; like most applications , has some options that you can enable or disable at compile time using the configure script . this is a list of available options .
for some of the comp@@ iling options , certain dependen@@ cies need to be met so that they can be used . see the system requirements section for details .
activates de@@ bug@@ ging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help in the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you should use full .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without difficulty using the setup dialog . the Setup dialog has multiple cards to set up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
the player window displays the player window in addition to the playlist . if the option is off , only the playlist window is displayed .
use mood bar@@ ometer : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for mo@@ od@@ bar . the option turns on the experimental function of the tuning bar@@ ometer .
design : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for mo@@ od@@ bar . this changes the color scheme used for the mood bar@@ ometer .
storing mood files in music files : this feature is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for mo@@ od@@ bar . if this setting is enabled , .@@ mood files are stored at the location of the appropriate music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored in the settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; stored ( usually ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / mo@@ od@@ bar / ) .
external Browser : lets you choose which browser to be started from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; when a browser is needed .
using other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser which is not in the list above .
save playlist when you exit , automatically saves the current playlist when you exit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; enable this option if you do not want to lose the current playlist when you exit .
relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : if you enable this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; use relative paths to the music files starting from the location of the playlist . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files is stored .
to keep up @-@ to @-@ date piece changes visible , it causes the playlist to scroll up / down to keep the current piece always visible in the visible window area .
when changing parts to context browser automatically changes the context browser as soon as the next piece is played .
in the App@@ ear@@ ance you can customize the look &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the section is divided into three parts .
in the Fon@@ ts section you can select the use of different fonts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can select fonts for the following area : playlist windows , player windows and context browser . click Select ... so you can select a font you want from the selection dialog .
with the choice of Custom color scheme , you have the choice of choice and can set your own color scheme . to do so , use the color selection activated colors for foreground and background color .
resume play on startup causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after program start , resume play automatically with the piece at the point with which it has been stopped at the last stop .
setting up the On @-@ Screen @-@ Display sub@@ window allows you to turn on the O@@ SD . when using on @-@ screen display , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly .
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check box shadow causes the text to be sh@@ aded in the O@@ SD .
using your own colors gives you the option to customize the O@@ SD colors for font and background . clicking on the color areas opens the dialog to select color sel@@ ections . if your own colors are not enabled , the pre @-@ set &amp; k@@ de ; colors are used .
the Display @-@ Text entry field displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering plac@@ eholders , the O@@ SD can be adapted to your needs . below is a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean .
the screen option is intended for X@@ in@@ ama users , so you can specify on which screen of a multi @-@ monitor environment the O@@ SD is supposed to appear .
the card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop @-@ down box . some drivers still activate more settings in this card .
the collection card collection is used to set up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and the type of database for the collection .
here you can select the folder that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for music files . to include a folder in the collection , select the check box next to its name . this section also contains check boxes for setting the selected folders .
Browse sub@@ folders recur@@ sively : this causes &amp; Amar@@ ok to search for music both the selected and their sub@@ folders .
monitor Chan@@ ges : enables &amp; Amar@@ ok to monitor the selected folders on changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . in addition , an incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection .
import play@@ lists : causes &amp; Amar@@ ok to add all found play@@ lists to your collection folder ( .@@ pl@@ - and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists will later appear in the playlist browser .
the Collection Database is used to select a database for the collection . the drop down sel@@ ector driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , additional set @-@ up in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l sub@@ window is necessary .
the My@@ S@@ q@@ l setup section is used to set the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; on calcul@@ ator : specify the host on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . after that , the network port is entered , under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is established .
use User@@ name : and Password : to enter the data needed for connection to the database .
the last@@ .@@ f@@ m card card supports the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations for the current piece if necessary .
here you enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you do not have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
send played pieces and update the profile : this setting allows &amp; Amar@@ ok to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
call similar interpre@@ ters : after activating this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; get a list of similar interpre@@ ters to the played piece . note : you do not need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this function .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . more information can be found in the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
Amar@@ ok just needs the package k@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . so you need to have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the programs included in it , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a little guide on how to compile k@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
some functions such as the O@@ SD require that your window manager contains the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ top@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work , but flu@@ x@@ box will work for example . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because these provide an excellent development environment .
probably one of your files causes an error in the Tag@@ li@@ b library for days . you can locate the file by searching in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b Developer at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also app@@ end the broken file that caused the crash . after that , you can delete the file and leave the collection again .
it is mostly because Tag@@ li@@ b crashes when reading the met@@ a information from this file . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b Developer at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you are using MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for it in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is somewhat more sophisticated .
make sure that all of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used libraries are compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if , for example , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ li@@ b but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , then this leads to crashes when processing met@@ a information .
if you are using K@@ DE with ar@@ ts@@ d then disable autom@@ . switch off if in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or at least use no value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace via e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens during a crash ) . if it is a common crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be fixed .
this is because many programs write data as U@@ TF @-@ 8 in the met@@ a information , but they do not feature Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; File $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; does not exist &quot; unless -@@ f $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ mp@@ 3 &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; error when writing the tags of $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; unless $ mp@@ 3 &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; U@@ TF@@ 8 ) ;
this script needs the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b . it can be installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b &apos;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( Rand@@ om mode / repetition / Dynamic playlist ) are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . note that in some cases , you have to click on a symbol for up to three times until this setting shows its effect .
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ ok@@ app : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , then check if Amar@@ ok uses the correct q@@ t library . this allows you to check with ld@@ d &apos;@@ which amar@@ oc@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
to fix this error , you may need to remove any conflic@@ ting Q@@ t version or modify / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok first finds the correct version .
there are several possibilities . most installation problems are easiest due to the help of an expert your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help with other users or developers . you can also use the forum and the I@@ RC under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ o@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ ok .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable to search for help . please enter only one error there , if something is due to the correction of an error in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; only an empty playlist will appear . how do music pieces come in there ?
this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
to make the interface appear intuitive , the Start sub@@ window has been converted to the Statistics window . you will find it in Extras Statistics .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars represent the rating by the user while the points are calculated automatically .
to rate pieces , the rating column must be displayed in the playlist . click on the playlist &apos;s title bar and select column Evaluation . you can also use the short@@ cut Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove and then press Del on your keyboard . or right @-@ click on your selection and then select Remove from playlist from the drop @-@ down menu .
drag a playlist file into the playlist and let them drop as you would do with other files . that &apos;s how easy it is : - )
in the playlist , next to the Add button , the Play@@ list button is stored . click on it .
probably the program x@@ m@@ ms @-@ config is missing . install the x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . also look for lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ ali@@ zations .
the equ@@ ali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . you can also find it via the menu bar under Tools E@@ quali@@ zer ....
no ! yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses a back@@ end independent approach , so the actual question must be : which media types do G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you can see , we support pretty much every imagin@@ able audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and PNG !
it may ! you may use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which no MP3 deco@@ ders are provided with the default ( for patent reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F2 , g@@ g : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , Enter key
start the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; play MP3 &apos;s : - )
if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa @-@ sink , the device must provide a bl@@ ender . a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously output audio . this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixer ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( software mixer ) .
the output of this command should help you find the cause of the problem and a solution . you may need to provide a different sink for G@@ Stre@@ amer ( e.g. os@@ s@@ sink ) .
this does &amp; Amar@@ ok ; already . don &apos;t forget that media must first be deco@@ ded . you can &apos;t simply send an MP3 to AL@@ SA , you would only hear a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer is reading the file , de@@ code it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . exactly like X@@ M@@ MS .
even X@@ M@@ MS enco@@ des the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open sound@@ server with the highest possible priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the sound buffer size ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that the ar@@ ts@@ wra@@ pper SU@@ ID is set :
with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE multimedia co@@ dec@@ s that can cause disturbed playback . read this error report . enlarge the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help well .
either you do not use the Arts driver , but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia to get the faster Arts co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
probably use the Arts driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver was strongly optimized for Analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less iner@@ tia react the visu@@ ali@@ zations . yes , this is a mistake , please help us fix it .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crashes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; off . why ?
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you have to register all the components . run @-@ register to register all G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask the I@@ RC channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer .
try this ( finish Amar@@ ok first ! ) : - Download and install ff@@ m@@ peg , once as a system administrator and once as your normal user . then delete all the ff@@ m@@ peg files in the module folder of G@@ Stre@@ amer ( you will find the module folder with the latest config / G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and execute it again . now start &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
if you have a list of suggestions / wishes , please send it to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album by the British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very much and find that the name sounds good . besides , the name contains the magic K ... : )
thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and let it run with the alarm command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play
this command lets &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playing . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before going to bed , then you are wo@@ ken up by the soft tones of the music that you stopped before going to bed .
how to get the current song in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; learn running titles if you &apos;re on a different computer ?
if there is a working SSH environment , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you the interpreter and the title of the running piece : SSH -@@ i ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ usable name Amar@@ ok player now@@ Pla@@ ying
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this pres@@ upp@@ oses that your identification is in ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa file .
visu@@ ali@@ zations can be separated from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; click on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer will open in an independent window in the size modi@@ fiable window .
the combination of C@@ trl + right mouse button puts a piece in the click sequence into the queue . pressing the Enter key after a search in the playlist will play the first search result and reset the search .
OK , the player window and the playlist have tri@@ cky features , but how does the icon in the system section of the control bar look like ?
click the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; on the title of a browser . in the context menu , you can select which browsers should be displayed .
my Personal Fol@@ der $ HO@@ ME is located on a NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok the collection database cannot be created and many error messages appear on the console . what now ?
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you need to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok to a local drive , or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support .
insert the CD , then click on Audio CD in the menu . it opens a file browser with multiple folders . for normal reading , switch to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a Kon@@ quer@@ or window . instead , you can use files from the folders mp3 or og@@ g instead .
Q@@ Str@@ ing@@ List values = query ( Q@@ String ( &quot; SE@@ LE@@ CT player counter , cre@@ at@@ ed@@ ate , &quot; F@@ ROM statistics &quot; &quot; W@@ HER@@ E ur@@ l = &apos; % 1 &apos; ; &apos; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( escap@@ e@@ String ( ur@@ l ) ) ) ;
basically , this adju@@ sts the previous assessment with a decreasing value , based on how often the piece was played . the more often the piece was played , the less influence each individual rating has on the overall result .
you can enter the rating for a piece by clicking on a column heading in the playlist window with the right mouse button . then you can change the rating of a piece as well as all other attributes , namely by clicking on the piece by right @-@ clicking on the piece and editing : selecting a rating or pressing F2 . you can also edit the rating in the Metad@@ ata dialog .
the developers don &apos;t want you to tell you when you want to release a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a set release plan that will not be combined with the short @-@ term scheduled plan of Amar@@ ok .
this is a new function in Amar@@ ok , which some users can also find annoying . de@@ activate the option icon while playing anim@@ ate in the general settings .
the Analy@@ zer is part of the toolbar . select Set@@ ting Settings ... and take the desired changes there .
download a design , or create your own . then install it under Amar@@ ok ... App@@ ear@@ ance Con@@ text browser design , click New Design ....
the icon was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphics Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) . to avoid difficulties , it was removed .
Kon@@ quer@@ or Navigation Pan@@ e allows you to monitor and control &amp; Amar@@ ok ; while browsing the Kon@@ quer@@ or tab . then start Kon@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 to view the navigation pane . then click on the Settings button ( top ) and select Add Amar@@ ok to drop down menu .
audio c@@ robat is a free service to the information about which pieces are played on an independent server . the service is free and you only need a free username and password . Audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler is fully supported by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; supported .
if you want to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest version available . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crashes and therefore a lot of error reports .
probably &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you have installed x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer . therefore , the . / configure routine does not compile these output modules . you need to re@@ configure and install Amar@@ ok ; re@@ configure and install .
now I &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new installed , but the output modules still don &apos;t appear . and now ?
probably you use a distribution that inst@@ alls the development files separately from the actual program . although G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , the necessary developer files are missing . you now have to install the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ de@@ vel package . the same goes for x@@ ine , you need to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . then you need to re@@ compile and install again .
I get the error G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ IT@@ ICA@@ L * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos;s no type .. How can I fix it ?
your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer was compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking , which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you must compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without P@@ rel@@ inking . a tip from mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : use no L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS when you compile Amar@@ ok .
I get the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 , although the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed .
in order to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time module must also be installed next to G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad .
the present is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
you play an MP3 Stream , but the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ mad is not installed . install the module and then run it as a system administrator . then restart Amar@@ ok .
I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can I use Amar@@ ok to use the second sound card ?
set up the Amar@@ ok settings ... audio output you enter the device . typically , e.g. h@@ w : 0 for the default sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second one .
here is an example of ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with an onboard AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
p@@ cm@@ .@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type plug sla@@ ve@@ .@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 0 &quot; } c@@ tl@@ .@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ cm@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type plug sla@@ ve@@ .@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 1 &quot; c@@ tl@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
enter in the setup dialog from x@@ ine now us@@ b @-@ audio , and the output takes place on the USB sound card . so @-@ li@@ b takes care of the conversion of sampling rate , channels and so on .
if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , disable the check on sound@@ card supports m@@ map .
we are sorry , but the audio output with Arts will not be taken care of . you can of course take this problem by yourself ! if you want , you can become the new so urgently needed tut@@ or for arts : )
listening to music should be quite simple ! for this reason , there is the setup assistant that is displayed at the first start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if you want to update your collection later or simply don &apos;t like the wizard , then this quick start guide will help you . with your help you will have set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; set up in a few minutes .
creating a playlist is very simple . drag items from the collection browser to the playlist . if you are happy with the playlist , you can save it by using the Play@@ list button . if you are happy with the playlist , you can save it by using the Play@@ list button . you will find this button in the toolbar of the playlist window .
if you have your own play@@ lists , you can add them to the playlist browser . if the playlist is included in the folders of your collection , and you have the option to import play@@ lists , you &apos;ll find different ways to load the playlist .
to play an audio CD , select Ac@@ tions Audio CD in the menu bar . it opens a file browser with multiple folders and the CD pieces in WAV format . simply drag the wa@@ v files into the playlist and then press the playback button .
the audio CD function uses the protocol Audi@@ oc@@ d : / and is not compatible with all available drivers .
the burning function can also be found in the playlist . just click on one entry with the right mouse button and follow the burning menu . you have here different ways to burn a CD .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; pres@@ ets the installation of some software packages . the required packages are listed below . in addition , some additional packages are listed that make work with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; more enjoyable .
if you install these packages via a package management system ( e.g. RPM or apt ) , you also need to install the development versions of these packages !
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a versatile multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . as any normal multimedia player has also &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a player window with the most important functions . additionally , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; however , a playlist that is superior to all others . additionally , the playlist window contains several browsers that can capture and browse your entire music collection .
in this chapter , it explains how all the functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used , including creating a collection and a playlist .
the Player Window is your one @-@ click &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center . at the top of the window is a scroll text display showing the currently running piece or the current stream . directly below is the area , the playing time , bit rate and sam@@ pl@@ er@@ ate of the current play . a click on this area changes the display of the currently expi@@ red play time for the remaining part of the play .
in addition , the Player window contains a selection of audio analy@@ zers , also under the runtime display . you can switch by the available analy@@ zer by clicking the left mouse button on the area .
the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Analy@@ zer can be separated from the Player window . press d on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer is displayed in an independent , enlarged window .
the PL and E@@ Q buttons are also displayed under the scroll text display . the button PL activates or de@@ activates the playlist window while the E@@ Q button is used to set the equ@@ ali@@ zer .
the rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons , the volume control and the piece position sli@@ der . use the sli@@ ders to adjust the piece position or volume . with the playback buttons you can start / stop playback and change to the next or previous piece .
using the built @-@ in equ@@ ali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio drivers . there are 17 pres@@ ets from classic to techn@@ o , and you can easily create your own preferences .
to display the equ@@ ali@@ zer , use Tools E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click the E@@ Q button in the player window . once you select the check box E@@ quali@@ zer , the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in operation .
the playlist of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most advanced playlist of all for &amp; k@@ de ; available multimedia players . it has many features that do not exist in any other player . but don &apos;t let the abundance of functions deter you , they are all easy to use .
the Play@@ list window can be divided into two main areas , the left side is the navigation pane . in the navigation pane you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist , such as the context browser . the playlist is easy to use and yet even for advanced users powerful enough .
the context browser displays various information regarding the current piece . its look can be adjusted with the help of context @-@ browser designs . the context browser contains three sub @-@ windows : music , text and interpreter . these three sub @-@ windows will later be explained in detail .
if you have earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you might notice that the sub@@ window will have dropped off . the information presented here is now divided into other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the information in the Statistics window can also be viewed ( Extras statistics ) .
the sub@@ window music shows information about the current piece , as well as the artist and the album .
the first section in this sub @-@ window displays information about the piece . in the title there is the name of the piece , artist and the album . below you see the cover picture of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol . click on this icon to track the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database .
under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol you will find more information about the current piece . you can see here how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation .
to display cover images in context browser , the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece . file formats .@@ jp@@ g , .@@ j@@ peg , .@@ gi@@ f and .@@ p@@ n@@ g are supported . the context browser will also display cover images which are either downloaded with the cover management or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
the next area , Recommen@@ ded pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will play inst@@ ant@@ an@@ e@@ ously .
among the recommended pieces are the favourite pieces of this interpreter . this area shows the five most rated pieces of the current interpreter .
you can set which information to be displayed in the music sub@@ window . click with the right mouse button somewhere in the sub@@ window and select from the context menu .
the last section , albums of the artist , lists all the albums of the current artist you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will work out and you will see the content of the album .
you can click on all the pieces in the individual areas to start playing immediately . you can also click on it with the right mouse button and then select one of the options for adding the piece or album to the playlist .
this function is very flexible and it is possible to download text from other web pages using self @-@ written scripts . as soon as you click on the text sub@@ window , try &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to download the text for the piece from the Internet . if no text script is running , you can choose which to start .
the Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics . the modified version is then stored in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s collection database . this does not require a running text script .
the Search button opens a search on goo@@ gle@@ .com based on the lyrics for the current piece ( in an external browser window ) .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t - only group@@ ed the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the interpreter . albums or genres are dis@@ regarded .
group@@ ing Artist / Album - First the pieces will be sorted by performer and below will be a further division after the respective album . if you want to see compil@@ ations or sound@@ track albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums will be shown at the beginning of the list under various performers .
group@@ ing Artist / Year - Album - S@@ ort by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the latest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default 0 - album name is related .
group@@ ing Album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabe@@ tically and will be ignored .
group@@ ing Genre / Artist - your pieces will be sorted by genre and sorted by artist .
group@@ ing Genre / Artist / Album - This setting works exactly the same way as the above , but is additionally sorted by album underneath the performer .
with the help of the remaining buttons , you can customize the group@@ ing as you like .
with the last button you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically record your collection once you change something at the selected folders . if you own lots of pieces , this might take a while .
a search filter is located directly below the toolbar . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . notes on how to use this filter can be found in the section to the playlist in this manual .
under the search filter there is a selection field , which allows you to filter out the recently added pieces to your collection . you can also choose different time windows , starting from the last 24 hours to one year . furthermore , you can of course also select your total collection , which makes the filter practically switched off .
by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser , you will receive the following options .
load - This emp@@ ties the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces in the currently valid order in playback .
to add a playlist - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on an entry , you can reach the same effect .
set pieces in queue - This function inserts the selected pieces into the queue . this will then be played next .
save as a playlist ... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist . you will be asked for a name under which the list is to be saved .
transfer Media Player - Add the pieces into the queue for transfer to the Media Player . for more details , see the section on the Media Player Browser .
burn all pieces of this interpreter / burn to CD - This will cause the selected pieces to be sent to K@@ 3@@ b and either as data or audio CD burned . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option is not displayed .
edit metadata ( for n pieces ) ... - This opens the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
( s ) Move files to the tr@@ ash bin ... - Open a confirmation dialog . if you confirm it , the selected files will be deleted from your computer .
mark as a compilation - Select the selected album as a compilation , and it appears under different interpre@@ ters .
highlight collection marking - Chan@@ ges a single album marked as a compilation album back into a normal album . after that the album will no longer be displayed under various performers but again by the associated performer .
the playlist browser makes handling of play@@ lists very easy . among other things , it also includes Intelligent Play@@ lists .
the lower part of the playlist browser contains the smart play@@ lists . these use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists at runtime . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played .
even created smart play@@ lists are possible . click Smart Play@@ list to open the dialog to create a new Smart playlist . there you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist .
the Media Player sub@@ window is used to connect &amp; Amar@@ ok ; using your portable media player ( e.g. iPod ) . to be able to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for example , to include your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod . if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; launched , you will find the pieces on your iPod sorted by performer in the upper list view of the Media Player browser .
to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired songs from the playlist and drop them to the list interpreter . if you &apos;re done , click Apply . this will upload the pieces to your iPod . if the transfer is finished , exit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; and release the drive connection for your iPod .
under the toolbar , there is a search area with which you can search for a file . the search is particularly useful in folders with very many files because in the file list all the files are hidden which do not match your search criteria .
in the lower part of the file browser you will find an address bar that lets you retrieve music from a given URL . if you enter tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musi@@ c.@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z and press enter key , you can access music in the music .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z file . now you can drag and drop the music from there into the playlist .
if the playlist is longer than in the window , the app@@ endi@@ x of the Shift key can be difficult . in this case , the holding down of the Shift key can be helpful : this will automatically insert dropped files at the end of the list , and not the mouse position .
the playlist retains all of the pieces you want to play . you can change the order by simply drag@@ ging the entries with the mouse to the desired place . once you enter letters , only the pieces will be displayed , which contain the letters . to reset the filter , press the back button until the text field is empty again .
if you enter search terms separated by spaces , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for entries containing all keywords . if you enter , for example , two three , the search will find all the entries that contain one , two , and three .
if you enter OR between the search terms OR , search for entries containing either one or the other search term . for example , one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces are found that contain one or two or three ( or a combination thereof ) .
if you want to search for entries containing spaces , then en@@ close the search term with quotation marks : Mike Old@@ field . this will search for entries that Mike Old@@ field contain , but not according to requests such as Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you specify a specific search column , you can also search for larger or smaller . for example : evaluation : &gt; 50@@ . this searches for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a certain keyword , set a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something looks for pieces that do not contain anything .
you can combine these syntax variations as you like . for example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bathroom . this searches for all the pieces that either contain Mike Old@@ field , or have a higher score than 50 and do not include the comment pool .
you can set the sequence of entries by pressing the C@@ trl key , then clicking with the right mouse button in the desired order on the entries . the entries then receive a label with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played .
the toolbar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist . on the left you will find the button Add to Add to the Play@@ list . to the right , you will find playlist Save , Emp@@ ty Emp@@ ty and Rand@@ om M@@ ics .
next , the kno@@ bs follow Un@@ do and Rest@@ ore . this allows you to und@@ o or restore changes to the playlist .
in the middle of the toolbar , a unique , larger analy@@ zer is located . the refresh rate can be set with a click of the right mouse button on the analy@@ zer .
the last button in the toolbar is the menu . it opens the same menu as that which you get in the player window over the right mouse button .
there are many more available buttons for the toolbar , for example , playback control and volume control . you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on the menu and setting up toolbar buttons ...
the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about the playlist . it displays the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the total playing time of all pieces . in addition , the status for random mode and retri@@ eval is easy to change by clicking the mouse twice in the respective display area .
you can also hide the status bar . to do so , disable the status bar option in the General Settings .
the context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking in the playlist on menu . by this menu you can reach the settings of &amp; Amar@@ ok ;
a click on this entry will open the visu@@ alisation plug @-@ in window . there you can select the visu@@ ali@@ zations of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; select .
this entry contains a sub @-@ menu with links to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
the cover management is a useful tool for managing your cover images . you can launch it by selecting actions cover management in the collection browser .
the cover management includes a list view of all albums in your collection . you can view all the albums of an interpreter in your collection by selecting the performer on the left .
with the View menu , you can choose what to display in the cover management . select from :
the queue management received your big draw in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this function , you have more control over the playlist . after you &apos;ve set a queue in the queue , a number next to the title appears in the playlist . this number represents the order in which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the pieces will play : 1 is played first , 2 as second , and so on .
when you want to add a piece to the queue , select the piece in the playlist and then click + . you can also simply add the pieces with the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist . you can then change the order of the pieces in the queue management .
there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already pre @-@ specified ( see the details of how to set up these later ) .
fill your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and add more random pieces while playing .
adds pieces based on load .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( formerly : Audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler ) . this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist . you don &apos;t need a Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this dynamic playlist .
double click on the playlist you want , drag it to the playlist window or right @-@ click on it and then select Load . in this way , your current playlist is replaced by the new one . so you should save the old playlist under certain circumstances !
the two pre @-@ set modes of Rand@@ om Mix and Play@@ list Mix immediately fill up your playlist and you can start playing directly . the playlist Recommen@@ ded pieces start with an empty playlist and you will have to add at least one piece of yourself from your collection , so your playlist will only be filled at the end of the first piece .
if you want to keep the current playlist , then enable the last possible dynamic mode : settings Dynamic mode . this will use your existing playlist as starting point . the dynamic mode can also be disabled via the same menu entry .
the New Fil@@ l button feeds the current playlist and adds new pieces to the dynamic mode . edit the playlist and edit the playlist to edit the playlist and you can change the settings .
right @-@ clicking on a dynamic playlist , you have the option to click Edit . then , the dialog opens to edit the playlist settings .
enter any name for the playlist here , but the name should be unique to avoid confusion .
if this setting is not active , your playlist will continue to grow , the setting for upcoming plays will be ignored and you will not hear a piece dup@@ licate in that playlist . however , if the setting is active , the played pieces will be removed while resp@@ ecting the settings .
played pieces - this is the number of pieces played at the beginning of the playlist . this allows you to easily see which pieces have been played recently .
this is the number of pieces that are to be added to the playlist by each played piece . if you set more than 1 , then the playlist will continue to grow because only one piece can be played and removed .
the settings on the right @-@ hand side are already described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialog you can select from already existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you want to cross multiple play@@ lists , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; random items from each of the play@@ lists you want to cross .
some scripts allow your own settings . you can customize the settings by starting the script and then clicking on Configuration .
you can install new &amp; Amar@@ ok ; install scripts by clicking on the script . it will open a select dialog in which a script package can be selected for installation . after you have installed the script , a new entry appears in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet .
if you don &apos;t want to use a script longer , you can delete it . to do so , select the script to delete , then click Un@@ install .
if you are looking for information to write your own scripts , please refer to the Scrip@@ ts section .
the dialog window visu@@ alisation plug @-@ ins is used to activate the available visu@@ ali@@ zations in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the window contains a list of all available plug@@ ins . to use a plugin , simply activate the check box next to the name .
this Quick Start aims to show you how to create an audio CD with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b in four steps . to track the steps you need to have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b , and have a folder with audio files .
this is a dialog box in which you can select which files you want to burn to CD .
if you want to burn an audio CD from MP3 s or other los@@ sy compressed formats then remember that you get a poor quality while re@@ encoding to MP3 , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is . you can check if an audio CD was created by a loss@@ less format .
in this dialog you can do nothing . please wait until the computer has finished the burning process .
this Quick Start is intended to show you how to use with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; copy a data CD in just four steps . to understand the steps you need to have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; have and put the source CD into the CD @-@ Rom drive .
to copy a data CD , please select Extras , Copy CD ... from the menu . you will now see a dialog with the possible settings for burning .
after you have done all &amp; k@@ 3@@ b settings , please press the Start button . you will now see a dialog which looks like this :
in this dialog you can track the progress of the copy process . once you have finished reading the original into the image file , you will be asked for an empty CD medium on which the data is to be burned .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burns the image file . you have to wait until the total progress has reached 100 % .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burns the image file . you have to wait until the total progress has reached 100 % .
the Q@@ T Designer tool U@@ IC can &apos;t find the wid@@ get modules . to fix this problem , start q@@ t@@ config and add $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS / li@@ b / k@@ de@@ 3 / plug@@ ins to the search path for libraries ( replace $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS by your base folder of &amp; k@@ de ; ) .
the website of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; can be found at www.@@ k@@ 3@@ b@@ .org , where you will receive the latest version of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; you can also get feedback from the forums and get news .
if you want to use , you need at least &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 and &amp; Q@@ t ; 3.1 .
&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program burns audio or data CD @-@ R@@ s in a run ( also called disk @-@ at @-@ once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a tex@@ tual description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&amp; c@@ d@@ record ; / m@@ kis@@ ofs ; : burns all kinds of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all the functions that also include &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; it also sel@@ ects &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; typically automatically &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; for burning CDs . in some cases , &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; however , it achieves higher quality when burned audio CDs .
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) . in the Internet , such programs are generally referred to as ri@@ pper .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis Library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , pat@@ ent@@ less and professional audio encoding technology and for dealing with audio streams . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis profits from open source and is in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by the O@@ GG Vor@@ bis decoder and encoder modules .
M@@ ad : this is a high quality MPEG Audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported .
l@@ ame : a well developed MP3 decoder that can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial enco@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 encoder module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source co@@ dec for loss@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio encoder module so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
Li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , ff@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack Decoder : other libraries for processing different audio formats . with ff@@ m@@ peg , for example , it is possible to dec@@ r@@ yp@@ t WMA files to burn them to an audio CD . de@@ co
SO@@ X : a utility that can convert and convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the So@@ X Audio Enco@@ der module .
trans@@ code : a command line program for video editing . you will need it if you want to read a DVD .
V@@ C@@ DI@@ A@@ ger : a feature full featured auth@@ oring system for editing , dis@@ assembling and analy@@ zing video CDs and super video CDs .
norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard stage . this can , for example , make sense for mixing mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without Norm@@ alize , the different recording levels of the different albums can lead to the unpleasant effect that the music pieces are played differently .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to run from CD and automatically play all videos in the basic folder of the CD .
this is a convenient way to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the associated sub @-@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on one entry will open the project .
saves the current project . once the project has been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new filen@@ ame .
saves the current project under a new filen@@ ame . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog Save As is displayed , with which you can choose folders and file name for the project file .
save all opened projects . that &apos;s the same as if you would call for each project file save .
closes the current project . if a project has been modified and not saved yet , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b . you can then disc@@ ard between saving and changes . you can also inter@@ rupt the closing and keep the project so open .
includes all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any un@@ saved project , what will happen , as if you have called for each project file close .
includes all opened projects and finished &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; for each non @-@ stored project , you will be asked what to do , as if you have called C@@ lose File .
when you enter this entry , you can select files to add to the project via the appearing dialog . this has the same effect as if you move the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files will appear in the basic folder of the CD .
opens the dialog &quot; Burn &quot; for the current project . this dialog is basically the same as the Properties dialog of the project . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to burn the medium . the burning dialogue can only be opened if the project already contains data .
opens the properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of them are described by what is the ? -@@ help described ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry only appears on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session into the current project . this is useful for you to get files from a previous session into the current project , even if this function is not used . it is intended for you rather than help , so you can see the files and folders already existing on the medium .
this feature only appears on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project .
opens the CD copy dialog . this also allows you to copy a CD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can only create an image from a CD which you can then burn later . you should also prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs .
this also allows you to copy a DVD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can only create an image from a DVD , which you can then burn later on . alternatively , you can also create a copy of a DVD with the help of the copying dialog , so the target medium must be large enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source media in the original form .
opens the dialog for del@@ eting a CD @-@ RW . this allows you to delete the entire contents or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
open the dialog to format a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) so the content is completely er@@ ased . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the writing modes over@@ writing and incre@@ mental .
the dialog asks you for a * .@@ is@@ o , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source that can then be burned immediately by pressing the Burn button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , but you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burn a previously created DVD image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ is@@ o file as a source of data , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the Burn button .
a previously loaded DVD video can be converted . this dialog window usually appears after reading a DVD in the table of contents , but can also be used alone . it contains information about the selected video , encoding settings , and even options for changing the size and cutting black edges .
displays information about the inserted media . this information is displayed in the table of contents and contains medium features such as the size and title length of the CD or DVD .
shows a list of toolbar items from &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is checked , the toolbar is currently visible in the main window .
when this is checked , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden .
the folder view displays an overview of your folders and the CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , its content is displayed in the table of contents . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info , locks and unlock the drive or ej@@ ecting the media .
the table of contents allows selecting and drag@@ ging files into the project view . the content view is also the interface for reading audio or video CDs if a drive has been selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in folder view .
the head bar is a narrow area , which is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the head bar has no real function , it only looks pretty and separates the project visibility clearly from the rest of the views .
this opens a dialog box for changing the key assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part , the key assignment can be adjusted below .
this will start the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wizard . this allows you to set the correct permissions for burning CDs and DVDs . therefore , you need to enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) at the start of the wizard .
opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here general program settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work at first . this dialog is intended for person@@ alizing and fine tuning of the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . with the help of this interface , parts of functionality can be controlled , for example , via a shell script .
to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can either use the d@@ co@@ p command line program or the somewhat more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the range of functions , so your taste and type of task is crucial to which of the contribut@@ ory programs you specify .
in this chapter , we assume that you use the d@@ co@@ p command line program . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you must first make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b is started . then enter something like the following on the console :
in addition to the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; -@@ functions that have all &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program common , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts described below .
the D@@ CO@@ P @-@ Interface from &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions such as copy@@ CD , format@@ ted DVD and other functions to create new projects .
D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) void occup@@ ation@@ C@@ dr@@ w ( ) void occup@@ ation@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ d@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ d@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively , you can create a project using the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project by using # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project By using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the above listed K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface , which can only be used on data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name , Q@@ String Charac@@ ter ) void add@@ Ur@@ l ( K@@ URL ur@@ l , Q@@ string parent ) void add@@ Ur@@ l ( Q@@ String ) void ren@@ ame@@ Item ( Q@@ String ) void ren@@ ame@@ Item ( Q@@ string path , Q@@ String New@@ Name ) void travel volume id ( Q@@ String id )
this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , multiple folders , and then add files to the new folder :
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der test d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der test d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p
&amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; an audio CD ; easy to read audio CD ; it can be read out and stored in MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG files . also other formats are possible depending on encoder which is installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; files in WAV files on the hard drive ) and by many encoding that enco@@ des these wa@@ v files ( these Ko@@ di@@ ers packages still need to be installed from the Linux distribution ) . more enco@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first , the tracks of the &amp; CD ; read out and saved into WAV files on the computer ( loss@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step , these WAV files ( usually one per title ) are compressed into the MP3 or O@@ GG format or even in other formats such as loss@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this has to be done now .
for the second step you have to install l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other Ko@@ di@@ ers . all of these programs are usually already available for any Linux distri@@ butions , so it is probably not necessary to compile anything yourself . however , if FLA@@ C is not used , its installation is not required .
which encoding / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer is a small introduction about enco@@ ders , audio quality and compression factors .
a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as already said , uses &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read out the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to b@@ ypass some copy protection . in any case , &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; even avoid the mechanisms of copy protection . just avoid the purchase of copy @-@ protected audio CD ; s !
while setting up only needs to be done ( the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration was found ) , afterwards the daily handling of reading a &amp; CD ; explained to the hard drive . this will ( hopefully ) lead to understanding for the lean approach of the user interface , which you will often stum@@ ble at the beginning .
can convert into many formats - depending on which encoding programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; get information from fre@@ ed@@ b from the Internet or can work completely without a network , with everything being recorded manually .
this is just a short list of the main window commands . on the step @-@ by @-@ step example , you will find more information on how to use this program as well as screen@@ shots with descriptions of the tabs for configur@@ ing the program .
starts the CD@@ DB request of the CD @-@ data according to the setup of request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established . )
start reading and - when an encoder is configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup guide - encoding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available encoder , so that the selection can be read with a different encoder as the default . it must be noted that previously the encoder in the encoding settings tab was configured in the setup dialog .
open the file manager so that an already loaded file is selected instead of a full &amp; CD ; read and code .
opens the Setup dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as logs , pic@@ es ) for program events ( such as read out &amp; CD ; finished ) .
opens the main setup dialog of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; with different card cards ( such as encoder , to set up the encoder ) , you need to go here before the program can be successfully used !
this chapter describes sound quality , enco@@ ders , and compression ratios and helps you choose the right encoder .
if no audio information is lost , a loss@@ less audio format is required . in addition to FLA@@ C , there are also others such as &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution . the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files .
among audio formats that lose information by data compression depending on your psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common . O@@ GG today may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 kb@@ ps ) , but above this bit rate the differences become less important , since both enco@@ ders produce very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ Not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is still supplied with most distri@@ butions for free , but there are open license issues
+ high to very high sound quality ( at high bit rates ) , but compared with O@@ GG slightly lower quality at lower bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG playback devices is present .
MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special auto stereo systems . today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices mostly only support MP3 format .
a short list of parameters for audio quality and the resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for more parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et standards &apos; = This setting should usually provide acceptable transparency for most people and most of the music pieces , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 kb@@ ps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . requires up to 320 kb@@ ps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 kb@@ ps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . always needs 256 kb@@ ps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems of high quality .
&apos; -@@ h &apos; = 128 kb@@ ps C@@ BR common stereo , compression ratio approximately 11 . 128 kb@@ ps for all pieces of a song . good enough for music of you@@ ths , portable devices and auto@@ ster@@ oids . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ kb@@ ps C@@ BR . this setting will be over@@ done for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want to have absolutely highest quality without regard to file size , then choose this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information that is entered manually or automatically fet@@ ched from the fre@@ ed@@ b via the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can hand over / use with &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; and the encoding program to generate the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files .
in connection with encoding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the encoding guidelines explain the switches for these programs .
for example to add the &amp; CD title to the keywords ( English : tag ) if MP@@ 3@@ s are enco@@ ded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ t@@ t of l@@ ame and title parameters of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; added . the result looks like this : &apos; -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button name in the wizard ) :
this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database , in which people can read the audio CDs , the information to upload / enter , so that all the others can download this information instead of entering the machine . it is to be noted that here only text is spoken : &amp; CD ; Tit@@ le , Artist , N@@ ames of Pi@@ eces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( note of the translation ) is not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from using the CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company can be har@@ med . anyway , neither the artist nor the music company can be har@@ med . anyway , any information can be obtained from a bum@@ ble@@ bee by a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtual .
in &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is active to select a check box ( sending an address ) . for the use of fre@@ ed@@ b it may be used with another ( fake ) address as the system furnished in the system . in this type of configuration , it appears , the e @-@ mail address when retri@@ eving the data from the server is not used ( This can only know the programmer who has checked the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; set to use fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirror server is to be used . this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the hosts .
a visit at fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org gives a current list of mirror servers for online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which reading program is used to store pieces from CD ; in wa@@ v files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ors that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; those who want to know more specifically , look for the source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; s. to note is that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution if this is not yet done .
to save the read wa@@ v files , the enco@@ ders and thus the desired file format can be selected . in the first opening are predefined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a loss@@ less compression for audio data ) on the tab for setting up the encoder . other enco@@ ders can be added on this tab .
the Ko@@ di@@ ers package must be installed by the Linux distribution in question before the encoder can be used . this is also required for the predefined encoder . more information about enco@@ ders can be found in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installing a encoder , you can get more information about its switches by entering a command like l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . &apos; l@@ ame &apos; needs to be replaced by the name of the encoder .
this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the write and read real on it and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio co@@ di@@ ers of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed . try to invo@@ ke both programs with a command line in a terminal . this could give an indication of what is wrong .
check if you don &apos;t want a copy protected audio CD ; check out the shell of the CD ; this will not succeed !
there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you are using other settings , this can give tips on how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , understand everything , but are somehow still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and our first &amp; CD ; read . we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 kb@@ ps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V1 stit@@ ches ( tags ) .
you must have c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . for example , a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found with a search engine , as it is considered not completely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can always do .
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have write permission on it ( eg ; by trying to copy something into the kon@@ quer@@ or ) .
the first section deals with the basic set @-@ up of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; something that is supposed to be done only once , and
the second section describes how to read a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for each read &amp; CD .
here we determine the encoding of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the resulting audio quality ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting audio quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 kb@@ ps ) . since we are la@@ zy , we share the program with the fre@@ ed@@ b to use the CD ; data from the internet .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change them at every reading of a &amp; CD ; change once the appropriate settings are found .
the device name is passed to the read@@ out program so it can read the &amp; CD ; -@@ Data / pieces .
frequently , / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your drive . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is present , the effective device name can also be specified . if you can access the drive with other programs , then a look at the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the existing entries of the device desig@@ nations for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the card chart General Settings . here is not much to do . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything is left / entered as shown in the screen@@ shot .
only in case of incomplete information is selected , so that you will be informed if information on creating keywords ( tags ) is missing .
the card chart CD ; -@@ Settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically download via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b calcul@@ ator .
note : the computer must be connected to the Internet during read @-@ out of the &amp; CD so that it can access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
the second selection field is easier , a &amp; CD ; found entry , immediately begins reading the &amp; CD ; . this is associated with low risk , if you are later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / filen@@ ames or tag entries , they can be easily changed . the directory / file name will be changed with Kon@@ quer@@ or@@ - &gt; ren@@ ame and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , keep in mind : if you want to enter everything manually , disable the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b will not be used . you can use fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode when you download the database before . however , if you use fre@@ ed@@ b in offline mode , the two sel@@ ections must be selected , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following card card .
CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data request , for calling &amp; CD ; information from the fre@@ ed@@ b server over the Internet . how does the system know which data is to get the CD ? read the section about fre@@ ed@@ b . set everything as shown in the screen@@ shot .
mode : we have not downloaded the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB @-@ Server : please go to the fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org site and look for a mirror server near you . on this way , the load is distributed between the hosts . however , this setting will work as the first attempt .
both work equally as far as the server is concerned , as many fire@@ walls boot the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there may be more luck with the protocol 80 , as the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet .
in this example , we do not want to send data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . de@@ activating the first check box should be enough .
just take the settings from the screen@@ shot . ( make sure the / tmp directory exists on your computer )
number of simultaneous pieces : sorry , there is one reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive ? parallel reading and encoding ? the author does not know , therefore simply try yourself .
CD ; after reading the last piece , check this to the &amp; CD ; disc@@ ard at the end of the process .
custom folder for temporary files : if you tick this , then / must specify the path / folder in which the WAV files are stored . if the field is not checked , the files are created in the private folder . do not forget this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files yourself .
enter everything as it is on the screen shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something has to be brow@@ sed to the right to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as mentioned earlier , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good hi @-@ fi stereo systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is approx . 224 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the resulting compression ratio is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; to restrict the creation of tags to version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags can also be deleted as needed . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
set the rest as shown in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside this example :
number of simultaneous WAV files : with a dual core or quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine , you can try to en@@ code more than one WAV file at the same time .
that &apos;s it , we just finished the basic set up of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; this configuration is used as standard for each reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music wis@@ ely , you never need to change it again .
in this section we describe how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; running on the hard drive . we will create MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music on the hard drive is organized , has been set up in the previous section , as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from the fre@@ ed@@ b is described .
since we use a &amp; CD ; use that is not yet contained in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look a little different from that for a &amp; CD ; with successfully obtained data collected from fre@@ ed@@ b . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually , instead of fet@@ ching them from the Internet . comments will point to the differences .
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
if this is not yet done , now the &amp; CD must be inserted into the drive that has been defined in the main window .
after a short moment , the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as in the screen@@ shot . this only if the &amp; CD ; can be identified as audio CD ; can be identified and read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this does not happen then look for help in the section Questions and Ans@@ wers or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings .
attention : if the CD has been successfully picked up by the fre@@ ed@@ b , all titles of the pieces are already completed and the name of the artist and the album will be shown .
in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; -@@ Key for your &amp; CD ; there , a window appears , and you can select the database entry that best fits your opinion to your &amp; CD ; fits .
if you have not selected the check box for the automatic query of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for Settings ) , you can also manually trigger this by selecting the first button in the toolbar . if you do not have a local database , but fetch the data from the Internet , you need the connection to the Internet .
e 1.2 step 02 : the CD Editor - input of the CD @-@ data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Current Tit@@ le &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist no longer has to be entered in the input field &apos; Current Tit@@ le &apos; unless you have a compilation of different artists for each piece .
the bottom comment field can be used for individual comments , the comment field on the album is used for comments that apply to all pieces of the CD .
attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the screen@@ shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name ( e.g. if all words start with capital letters or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments .
note : in this example , we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the commentary box . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least on what &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; maximum allowed . this option is set up on the encoding settings tab ; take a look at the section &apos; Basic Settings &apos; .
you can change the tag information of generated files later with tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also recre@@ ate ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
tags are not supported by all encoding and file formats . see the help of the encoder to get more information .
simply select an entry that obviously matches the style of the suff@@ es@@ ent CD ; in this example , this is not important as we do not transmit the &amp; CD data anyway . for more information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or ra@@ p for example are to be found under rock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after choosing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OK &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you come back to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the window of the CD Editor appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data we recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . simply enter the title of the piece and other information you want .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD ; entered .
attention : this window does not appear when you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted in one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button on the toolbar . note that the artist and the album are displayed above the parts list .
note that there is a check mark in front of each line of a piece . only the tracks marked as such will be read out . a simple click on the row will switch off the selection of the piece , or press the All items button at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once .
when selecting the selection process by clicking on the selection button , this window will appear for confirmation . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the entries and follow what is going on .
on the tab orders to switch to the order window . it is located in the left upper half of the window , directly below the toolbar buttons .
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is currently being read on the hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
you see this error message if you try to work with a encoder you have not yet installed . pieces that have not been successfully deco@@ ded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we have typ@@ ed here in the example . did you check if you have write access to the folder for the temporary files and the destination folder ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of reading the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : assignment 4 is the encoding of part 1 into the format MP3 . thus , read out and encoding in parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has not found a configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems to be configurable is the number of parallel processes to read and code . the used calcul@@ ator with an AM@@ D@@ 64 does not seem to have a problem with simultaneous reading and encoding ( of two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read out while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third order is enco@@ ded in the queue of the encoder . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window is displayed with a message for a short time in the upper left corner of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the encoder of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; will maintain CVS as part of the k@@ de@@ multimedia package today . if you are familiar with CVS , you can download an anonymous copy from there . however , most distri@@ butions already contain a pre @-@ compiled package , as &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package is . if you read this , you probably already have done it ...
this section is intended for people who compile from source files , and not for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help as the program can be adapted to your needs once it is running , then the following is right for you :
a program that calls up many different programs has many variants of settings . best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it shows screen@@ shots of the different mapping cards of the settings and also includes comments for options that are not used in the example .
hello , still reading ? even if only the help menu was cli@@ cked after the initial start of the program , without any clu@@ e as it should go on from this somehow empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ?
what is it all about ? who is reading this , probably already started the program . it should look like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; may it do . at least after contact with the author . and if you read this , he left this section and therefore agrees with this proposal .
strange , if you managed to get the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , you don &apos;t need these informations , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ aoke player from &amp; k@@ de ; besides others , it also features some properties that other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke real @-@ time high@@ lighting .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; support too . &amp; k@@ mid ; also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ul@@ tras@@ ound project driver needed for CI@@ S cards . AL@@ SA is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer .
&amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color , making it easy to follow the piece .
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so you can drag &amp; drop ; any MIDI file from one &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ windows can drag on k@@ mid .
supports the two existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( properties or text events ) .
when you stop &amp; k@@ de ; when you play a song , k@@ mid will start with the same song next time .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can select Open ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog with which help you can select the song you want .
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ windows to the &amp; k@@ mid window . this also works with several songs at the same time .
to play a piece of music , open it and press the Play button in the toolbar , select the item Pla@@ ying from the menu item , or press the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts as soon as you drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; ( for several pieces you will be added to a collection and then played succ@@ essively . )
as soon as &amp; k@@ mid , play a piece , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and going back and forth with the regulator .
if you find that a song is played too fast or too slowly , you can click the arrows at the left and right of the tempo display and change the playback speed . to get back the original tempo , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure affects the space bar like a pressure on the button pause or selecting the menu item pause in the menu item , thus interrup@@ ts the play . press the space bar while no play is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback .
lyrics can be stored in two ways in one piece of music . some pieces use text event , others use lyrics auction and others both . some pieces do not have any text : - )
in &amp; K@@ mid ; you can set which events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically as@@ cer@@ tained , which uses a song so you don &apos;t have to manually set anything manually . so , if you select the Automati@@ cal Text option in the Settings menu , you will automatically select the kar@@ aoke text . however , you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way .
if you want to specify an event type , select the text events or song events from the Settings menu . the same function also has the 1 and 2 keys .
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you summari@@ ze . these are played back in series . in this section you will see how you can efficiently use collections .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find it in the menu Collection under the item Organ@@ ize .... Click here on New and enter the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on the copy and speci@@ fying the name for the new collection . at the beginning , this collection will contain the same songs as the original .
if you have more than one collection , you can set the desired items in the collection manager .
the temporary collection includes all the songs you want to add to any other collection .
when you leave the application , this collection is not saved . remember that when you add a lot of pieces .
to add songs to a collection , you have to be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song with the Add button . it again appears the file dialog with which help you can select the song you want .
a second method to add a song depends on setting Automatic Add to the collection .
when automatic Add to the collection is enabled , a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening ( using File Open or Drag &amp; Drop ) .
when automatic addition to the collection is not activated , the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied when opening a piece .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the song you want and then click Remove .
you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the sequence from the pop @-@ up menu of the menu collections , the songs will be played in the order as they were added to the collection .
if you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order is re@@ defined .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the select list above the kar@@ aoke text .
to skip a song , select the Next song button , next song next song from the menu item or press the arrow on the right .
to jump back a song , select the button Pre@@ y piece , the entry Pre@@ dic@@ tive piece from the menu item or press the arrow on the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to be deleted and click the Del@@ ete button .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter , since it is not saved when leaving &amp; K@@ mid .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers which are not general MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI map transl@@ ates general MIDI events into events that the syn@@ thesizer understands .
for example , you can create a MIDI map that converts all events of Change Her@@ patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the Change Her@@ patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et type and therefore always lets you sound a trumpet if you originally had to play a piano .
if you only have one sound card , you don &apos;t need MIDI map , because all sound cards are GM @-@ compatible ( incl . A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) .
there are unfortunately no programs to create MIDI maps , so you have to edit the corresponding file by hand ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI map is a text file that stores all required implem@@ entations for playing a piece .
each section may appear only once , except the key@@ map section that may appear as often as desired . however , there is a prerequisite for each occurrence to have a different text ID ( see below ) .
def@@ ine PAT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; Name of Key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; Ano@@ ther Key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS ... EN@@ D
you see that Def@@ ine is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as email so that I can provide support in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support for devices that are not general MIDI compatible .
in this section you will see how the patches of General MIDI are m@@ apped to your specific keyboard . general use looks like this :
please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM @-@ patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and also leave no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to lay all the sounds that this instrument needs to sound with the number M . if your keyboard does not support a gun ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can use a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) which sounds similar to a gun . add the following in the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP segment :
so if a MIDI file is to play a note with Patch 127 ( the drum on your keyboard ) it plays the sound 60 , no matter what sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that here with the term drum @-@ patch the patch is meant where each note represents another percussion instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ al , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one where the sound means the pitch of the always same drum ( as some key@@ boards have ) .
the key@@ map section is used to specify how sounds are m@@ apped on a particular channel or instrument . the use is :
as with the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of the lines is very important , as well as their presence . so you have to create 128 entries .
you can define several key maps for each channel and each instrument . you just need to use different names in the first line .
Key@@ maps are mainly used to map sounds on the perc@@ ussions channel . see the provided Key@@ maps as an example .
this section can be used to map several channels to others . for example , if you want to swa@@ p the first and second channel , make it easy to use in the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP segment .
however , these settings are more useful for key@@ boards which have the percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern :
n is the channel that is represented on the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the key@@ map with the name name is needed for this channel . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored , which attempt to change the patch on this channel . in this case , the patch is always used .
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful , for example , to always use the perc@@ ussions patch on the perc@@ ussions channel .
Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio evalu@@ ates the value of Pit@@ ch Ben@@ der events . if a MIDI file sends a pitch @-@ Ben@@ der event with the value n , it is converted with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then re@@ directed . the value 40@@ 96 is used to avoid decim@@ al decim@@ al in the map file .
this setting is needed because GM suggests that a keyboard that gets a pitch @-@ Ben@@ der event will play a ton higher with the value 40@@ 96 . unfortunately , some key@@ boards try to play two sounds up to one oc@@ tave higher . to find the right value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid .
to use a MIDI map , simply open the MIDI Settings dialog . this can be found in the Settings menu , item MIDI Settings .
the channel view is a window with a full range of key@@ boards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards you can see which sounds are played right now .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel , there is a selection list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button lights no more green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the channel view ( until now ) has two different views to display the played sounds . in the Settings menu , select Settings under the point channel view : settings
the speed LCD displays the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
so if you find a song too fast to follow the lyrics , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music . it contains the notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc ; this allows the same MIDI file to perform on two different devices to very different results , just as two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way .
well , I can &apos;t force anyone to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 K@@ b , while an mp3 @-@ file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you get a similar sound quality . in addition to a MIDI file , you can also change the individual instruments , the speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything .
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; this happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; compiled without AW@@ E support . to fix the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example by k@@ mid ; &apos; s home page )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I do not want to add all files individually .
OK , support &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . just open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all the files and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window .
by default , enable automatic addition to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can press the arrow key on the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow playback . to restore the default tempo , double @-@ click on the LCD .
I have on a &amp; k@@ de ; Desktop an &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ windows with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( when I play a MIDI file ) or attached ( if I play a kar@@ aoke file ) or attached ( if I want to play a kar@@ aoke file ) , I only need to switch to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window and drag the desired file into the &amp; k@@ mid window .
if you want to listen to a file quickly without adding it to a collection , turn off the automatic addition to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection .
suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ M. , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mi@@ di . first , you just want to play the first file . so , set the setting Automati@@ cally add to the collection and open A.@@ mi@@ d. your temporary collection then contains exactly this a MIDI file .
then you decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection of all three files . how do you do that ?
these people have sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you very much ! when I hear these songs or see the postcard , this encourages me to write on &amp; k@@ mid ; to program .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; Mal@@ aga ( Spain ) . I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; I &apos;m still trying to take a bit of time for my hob@@ bies , but I &apos;m trying to take a bit of time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to collect MIDI files , make music and prove sentences .
if you want to know where to download MIDI / Kar@@ aoke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or , if you want to make me happy , write me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ ech@@ r @ ar@@ mis@@ is@@ .@@ es
if you send me a postcard from your place of residence or a MI@@ DI@@ - / Kar@@ aoke file from a local group , if you send me a postcard or a MIDI file , you should contact me , as I might already have the file .
I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and given no money to anyone . I would like to point out that I only use it further because / when I get feedback from users ( post@@ cards or emails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - corrected the defect that the pitch of AW@@ E cards was too high .
my thanks also goes to Jose Lu@@ z San@@ che@@ z for testing the AW@@ E support , Ign@@ acio Gar@@ cia , O@@ la Sig@@ ur@@ dson , Marc Di@@ ef@@ en@@ bruch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , bug alert or even a suppor@@ tive email .
and of course my thanks also apply to all these excellent musicians on the net who give us these wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ aoke files .
in addition to this , &amp; k@@ mid can also be found on his homepage , which is located under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ ra@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mi@@ d.@@ html . on the homepage you can follow the development , search for information and look at pictures . you will also find links to sites with other kar@@ aoke songs , &amp; etc ;
a sound card . I recommend you a sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer because the sound quality depends much on your sound card . it is not the same whether you use a FM or AW@@ E card .
if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you must compile &amp; k@@ mid ; compile with MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you had a sound card except that you cannot hear music naturally .
if you encounter any problems , please contact me by email or send an error message directly to me .
&amp; KM@@ Player ; is a simple user interface for M@@ Player , Ph@@ on@@ o and ff@@ m@@ peg . the program is used to play video files of formats supported by M@@ Player or Ph@@ on@@ on , as well as playback of DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; c@@ app@@ name ; was not yet finished as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this computer .
for additional help please check the page The K@@ DE website for new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; send user mailing list .
the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is the window with the playlist . and finally there is an information window that will only be displayed when information is returned .
it is possible to save the preferred connections under the menu book@@ mark , but these are single entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category permanent playlist .
of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy level . if you select an entry , its group and all its sub@@ groups will be copied to the current category and the playback starts with the associated entry .
the categories &apos; Current play &apos; , TV and permanent playlist can also be changed by editing the XML configuration files . of course , you can only do that if &amp; S@@ MB ; not running . the different files in the directory ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / S@@ MB players / , can be modified by an editor , but also by the application itself . to do this simply click on a name of a category , then select from the View menu and next edit mode . by clicking on a sub@@ group , only the XML content of this part is displayed .
after changing XML files , you must select a playlist from the menu and select Edit Mode , or select another category .
all changes will be lost if the editing mode is left or another group will be selected without the playlist .
as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; KM@@ Players ; some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files ..
the animation when starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c and changing &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 above option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be inserted easily .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; KM@@ Player ; note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation during startup doesn &apos;t need to be short , it is automatically finished by opening another source . however , this would be disturbing at the end animation , the user can therefore finish the application a second time .
a simple example of a start @-@ animation can be the display of a favorite picture : &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; body@@ like ; &amp; lt ; im@@ g dur = &quot; in@@ 2 &quot; sr@@ c = &quot; file : / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; meet &quot; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / body@@ like ; &amp; lt ; / Rating ; In the directory tests / some examples of S@@ MI@@ L are supported by &amp; KM@@ Players .
there is a tab for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the configuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Players ; here you can set the path from the M@@ Player and the intermediate storage size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for troubleshooting is the button &apos; Con@@ sole &apos; in the toolbar of KM@@ Players . here is the output of m@@ player .
there is no rider for this playback device in the configuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Players ; everything needs to be configured by manual editing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c , just like setting up the back@@ end by mim@@ et@@ ype . here is an example of how a flash movie is played with the sw@@ f dec mo@@ z@@ illa module :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; KM@@ Players ; it can even be played into the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
for the &amp; KM@@ Player to play &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , the &amp; KM@@ Player ; module as service provider for the mim@@ e type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the setup dialog file assignments of K@@ DE must be given .
the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; KM@@ Player ; can be started in a console application and searched for error messages regarding the loading of the browser module library . if there are no errors , the back@@ end output is within &amp; KM@@ Players ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu to check ) .
to ensure that a given back@@ end is taken for a specific mim@@ e type ( of course only if this is also determined ) , it must be done by manually changing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . for example , Ph@@ on@@ on should play all og@@ g files :
&amp; KM@@ Players ; can play cards from TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ cd ) . before TV can be watched , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog , or the configuration file can be edited manually .
to configure the V@@ DR ( Video Data Recorder ) settings in the KM@@ Player dialog in the settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le- &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port should be used . there should be detected ports of which one is selected . the encoding must be found ( eg@@ . it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a dv@@ b in it .
since the V@@ DR support of KM@@ Players can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( presumably this type of playing video devices under Linux is the only one working ) . for this reason , the video for@@ lin@@ ux extension for the X server must be functional . for the X@@ Free@@ 86 server , the following must be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) :
internally , S@@ MB uses various names for the sources . at the time of creating this documentation , this is dv@@ d@@ nav@@ resource , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , intro@@ source , pi@@ p@@ es@@ ource , t@@ v@@ scanner , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ ones . when enabled , they start playing the playlist .
is there any hint of how I can make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter when I play from it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
yes , the command HD@@ PAR@@ M -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is to be run as user root after installing the device . it is absolutely safe to make sure that / dev / c@@ drom is on the CD@@ ROM drive .
x@@ ine starts only slowly , why does my CPU have to be tested for its performance every time ?
note : the response is over@@ hau@@ le.@@ k@@ x@@ ine@@ player will automatically need the last saved value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU .

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is needed to compile &amp; dump .
L@@ ate@@ x ; : a professional typ@@ es@@ etting application . under Unix @-@ like systems it is likely to rely on the package &amp; tex@@ live ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux distribution . for the installation , the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD should be used .
the &amp; Ki@@ le ; Project includes some already compiled packages from &amp; Ki@@ le ; for various distri@@ butions . these enable easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the box ; -@@ website .
this manual is for everyone - regardless of their experiences with &amp; latex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; Ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users probably hardly have to read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , the contact via the box should be made .
if you have questions to or compile from &amp; Ki@@ le ; or if extensions are requested , this should be addressed to the mailing list Ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; latex ; environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ desktop . &amp; Ki@@ le ; provides the possibility to use all &amp; latex ; functions in a graphical interface and within this a simple , immediate and tailor @-@ made access to all &amp; latex programs . furthermore , the easy to use wizard , the &amp; latex ; -@@ reference and powerful project management need to be called .
to learn more about &amp; k@@ ate ; and to learn its possibilities the manual to K@@ ate should be consul@@ ted . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start there directly with reading the chapter works with the editor of &amp; k@@ ate .
for &amp; latex ; is the correct pron@@ unciation : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . while the original &amp; tex ; difficult to use , also a lay@@ man ( lay ) &amp; latex ; -@@ mac@@ ros may also use . a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it comes from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port .
if only a good view to latex is given , it is not the ultimate book for it . to be able to master correctly , good books such as H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; latex ; : document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 should be used .
just as other mark@@ up languages includes &amp; latex ; an introduction with which the general properties such as paper format , page number@@ ing and text size are defined as well as a body with the text . the introduction contains at least the command \ \ &apos; begin { document } and must be closed again with the command \ \ end { document } .
the Quick Cli@@ mb@@ ing Wizard of &amp; Ki@@ le ; is a useful feature for quick creation of a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; selecting the wizard ( Men@@ Ã ¼ ) provides some possibilities for creating the document . there may also be some settings related to the document .
document classes : this defines the type of document to be created : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , letter &#91; letter &#93; , report &#91; report &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , Proj@@ ector &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , slides &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or Custom .
encoding : this is used to set the encoding of the system . modern systems are increasingly using the U@@ TF @-@ 8 encoding as standard . at best U@@ TF @-@ 8@@ X should be used ( for correct processing of latex ; documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used auxiliary packages for latex ; for the integration they only need to be selected in the check box .
article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) .
new users now don &apos;t have to worry about it . these are just a brief description of the functions and further information is given in the section .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides - just like other source editors - the high@@ lighting of the commands , settings and elements ( as well as the in@@ appropriate ) . by &amp; Ki@@ le ; if you notice greater areas of a green text on the screen , it is very prob@@ able that some mathematical environment is not closed . however , it will save you through the modest appearance of the output file . however , it is spar@@ ed by the high@@ lighting time and pru@@ dent .
automatic execution of the settings will automatically create a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) from &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically generates a blank line ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) and the corresponding line to the schedul@@ er of the command ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be disabled in the menu settings box ; set up La@@ Te@@ X commands .
all documents are usually sub@@ divided into some elements . &amp; latex ; allows dividing the document into the following elements ( apart is the highest and sub @-@ paragraph the lowest element ) :
in view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a click of the mouse .
when creating your own &amp; latex ; files can be very helpful when searching for a DVI file ; a click with the middle mouse button on the DVI ; -@@ viewer to the corresponding row in &amp; latex ; -@@ source code .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as the font and is besides PDF the output type of &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; there are many tools for viewing , converting and printing DVI ; -@@ files for different systems and devices .
when the search box is used , the elements of the DVI ; file are connected to the editor and as soon as one element was cli@@ cked into the DVI ; file , the corresponding part is bound in the &amp; latex ; source text was cli@@ cked to the corresponding location in the DVI ; -@@ viewer .
master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master document , working with other included .@@ tex files is simplified . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set over project project settings .
quick construction : the &amp; latex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( unless there are any errors in the source code ) .
file monitoring : in this mode , the DVI file is to be awak@@ ened to mou@@ th@@ guard units . and there is no call from &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after the quick construction .
when viewing the Edit toolbar , the three large sel@@ ections should be highlighted . the selection fields have been developed for quick incorpor@@ ation of common elements into the document . the first selection field is for quick breakdown of the document into parts , chapters , sections ... The available &amp; latex ; -@@ commands for sub@@ division are :
the Other is available for selection of items such as keywords , notes or references . the options available are :
name : with this command a name for a section , a picture , or other item is created .
reference : used for reference to a specified term ( selection via a selection box possible ) .
when using quote , a selection list is displayed with literary entries . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; this only works if the file belongs to a project . for editing &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files are appropriate editors . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can also be written in &amp; Ki@@ le ; by hand .
the last drop @-@ down box with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ ter e is used for defining the font sizes e . the letters can be set for the main text , the notes , etc . there are the following letters for reference :
when calling &amp; ki@@ le , there are two choices available : 1 . the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the type of document and maintaining the settings . 2 . the document can be written from scratch using the hand .
the brackets after the command \ \ &apos; docum@@ ent@@ class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; specifies the size of the font . if the font size is not set at the beginning , this can also be done in the text .
once the above source code example has been entered , the &amp; latex ; source code must be compiled . the easiest way to do this is to use the menu Build or button quick construction .
the source code must be saved before comp@@ iling . &amp; Ki@@ le ; stores the storage automatically .
if the document is not comp@@ iling , it should be searched for errors in logging . when using Quick @-@ Lock &amp; Oc@@ ular ; it should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the logging process should also be taken into account .
an environment ( environment ) is a text , which is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font guide e 12 is created , and only a few columns should have a different font . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } allows for example a modification of the font size e within the environment .
the changes are considered only within the environment ( by \ \ begin } environment } to \ \ end { environment } . there is no restrictions ( number ) for the changes within an environment .
there are many possibilities to answer the document &apos;s read@@ ability and ease of use . for example , certain fonts , fat printing , ital@@ ics , sub@@ missions , etc. can be added . these commands end either with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for ital@@ ics and is active as long as it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a set can be represented itali@@ c with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ quote : creates a quote in the document . the quote begins with \ \ begin { rate } and ends with \ \ end { quot@@ a } .
following the background to write the source text with the &amp; latex ; mark@@ up language , now follows a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; quot ; .
as soon as a bit of text was entered in the wizard , some adjustments should be made for the better read@@ ability of the document . at least one quote , a few passages in bold and ital@@ ics , and a poem can be used to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been viewed , it can be returned to the editor by using the Editor View or C@@ trl E ( for internal viewers ) .
once the DVI file is created , the document can be printed or converted to a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try and have fun .
DVI ; is an independent file format ( eng@@ l . D e V ice I n@@ atively ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .d@@ vi output such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF converter or computer screens .
for printing a &amp; DVI file , the same steps as for the creation of the document are necessary ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - the document can then be printed using File Print ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the toolbar allows the conversion of the DVI ; file to other formats . once the DVI file is made of the &amp; latex ; source code , the conversion can start in desired other formats using the buttons in the toolbar .
the search function allows the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position within the DVI file .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a corresponding setting for all and latex ; binding files . for this only Modern under Settings box must be set up ... Tools building should be selected .
to perform the search function , the mouse poin@@ ter must be positioned in a row of the source text and subsequently be cli@@ cked on the search box . the jump to the corresponding location in the DVI ; viewer is then carried out .
with this function in &amp; Oc@@ t. ; with a click of the middle mouse button in DVI ; -@@ document the corresponding and latex ; -@@ document from &amp; Ki@@ le ; open and spec@@ kl@@ ed to the respective row . for this you have to define &amp; Ki@@ le ; in &amp; Oc@@ t. ; set as text editor ( Set@@ ting Settings ... Editor )
if there is no error when using the &amp; DVI ; -@@ viewer , an error may be present . if there is an error , it will be displayed in the logging file or in the message window .
the log file causes the source of error in the source code . in the editor , the causes Previous La@@ Te@@ X errors and N@@ Ã ¤ ch@@ ster La@@ Te@@ X errors can be used between errors . the logging file always specifies the line in which the error appears . in order to view the error line , the error in logging must be cli@@ cked and &amp; Ki@@ le ; jump to the wrong line .
once you click on the corresponding button on the toolbar , a window will appear to select the template you want to use for the document . the default options are :
when choosing empty documents , a document can either be re@@ written from scratch or used to quickly create a new document . more information can be found in the section .
hands @-@ free users of &amp; latex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created in &amp; Ki@@ le ; created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / latex ; file must be opened or a new file will be created . &amp; Ki@@ le ; can create a new template by opening an existing document and selecting file template from document ... Create .
when creating a new document from a template using File New , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set in Settings box ...
when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS $ $ : this string is replaced by entering into document class . typically , it is used as follows : \ \ &apos; docum@@ ent@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS $ $ &#93; { Item } .
the easiest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created this way , the following steps must be performed :
when creating a new document , your own template can then be selected instead of the default ones .
a template can be created from any and latex ; files can be created . if an easy way to create a template is required , you should search for a template found on the Internet and the steps described below .
&amp; K@@ ate ; used &amp; k@@ ate ; as an internal editor . &amp; k@@ ate ; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and high@@ lighting of many different types of text files ( including and latex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for &amp; k@@ ate ; can be done in the Tools directly from &amp; Ki@@ le ; out .
to learn more about &amp; k@@ ate ; and its options should be consul@@ ted from the manual to K@@ ate . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start there directly with reading the chapter works with the editor of &amp; k@@ ate ; begin .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a very practical &amp; latex ; command reference that can be called over the Men@@ tion Help La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains an exceptional description of almost all commands which can be found in &amp; latex ; use as well as their syntax .
double @-@ click with the pressing C@@ trl key to select the &amp; tex ; this means that by clicking on \ \ par of \ \ par \ \ big@@ skip only \ \ par is selected .
when drag@@ ging the text with pressed left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the clip@@ board .
when using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key , parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; has the possibility to search through different kinds of source texts and to emphasize them . for example , the &amp; latex works ; -@@ commands from normal text and also mathematical formulas are highlighted by a different color .
many assistants can add additional jumping nets . this is a separate type of book@@ mark within the text . the menu items do the jump to the next or last jump brand . this is also highlighted , so that it is automatically retri@@ eved when the first character is entered .
the Edit is probably one of the main aspects of using a program like &amp; Ki@@ le ; although &amp; k@@ ate ; already offers excellent possibilities , have been added in &amp; Ki@@ le ; important functions for writing a &amp; latex ; -@@ source text added . &amp; latex ; notified of many environments and groups and therefore support &amp; ti@@ pping ; special commands for their selection . under Edit Sel@@ ection are the following commands for text selection included :
he@@ als a whole paragraph ( group of lines which contain a blank line on both sides ) . this extended meaning does not include a text with continuous lines ( like in other text editors ) . this extended meaning includes tables , &amp; latex ; commands and all other lines of the source text . the only explo@@ iting thing in &amp; Ki@@ le ; is that the Ab@@ yss@@ al is separated by two empty lines .
the word is selected under the current cursor position . this selection also has an extended meaning since this command also contains &amp; latex ; -@@ commands with a restore passage ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
to delete a part of the document , this can be selected first and removed by pressing the Del@@ ete key . &amp; k@@ ate ; provides the key C@@ trl ; K with which the entire line is removed . &amp; Ki@@ le ; provides with its own commands for faster possibility . under Edit , the following commands are contained to read the text :
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; Ki@@ le ; is contained in the description to edit select paragraph .
it has already been clari@@ fied that environments play a central role in &amp; latex ; therefore , &amp; Ki@@ le ; for further orders under Edit environment for a possible simple work with &amp; latex ; .
with this command , jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
with this command , jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the command to lie@@ uten@@ ant in the environment .
if the cursor is before or within the command \ \ begin { ambient } , jump to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted surrounding commands , the track view can be lost quickly . this command closes the last opened environment so that the ne@@ sted surrounding structure is not destroyed .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; also offers special commands for the &amp; latex ; groups that are defined by bra@@ ces { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are some important commands that correspond to those from the editing environment .
with this command , jump to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the sharpen@@ ed bracket .
with this command , jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the welded clasp .
if the cursor appears before or behind the bra@@ ces of a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # , jump to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted group brackets you can quickly lose track view over . this command closes the last opened group so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups will not be destroyed .
in &amp; latex ; two simple quotes are used as a substitute . for the beneficial implementation it is used in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the sign is used for two simple quotes . &amp; ki@@ le ; knows this case and applies two closing quotes for latex ; one .
this automatic application of double quotes can be set up under Settings box ... La@@ Te@@ X can be switched on and off .
foreign specific settings ( e.g. n@@ german or en@@ grav@@ ings ) can also be used , so that German or French suits can be used . there are also many other languages available .
pressing Shift ; Enter key for &amp; box ; an intelligent line break . if the current position is located within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; Ki@@ le ; not just a line break but at the same time the command \ \ item .
trace &amp; dump in a table environment ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with a subsequent line break .
even better - &amp; Ki@@ le ; is intelligent enough to support pre @-@ set &amp; latex ; - or custom environments . these can be added under Settings box ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X .
some users want to arrange the columns in spread@@ sheets and thereby all E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) among each other . &amp; Ki@@ le ; try to er@@ ase this . while holding Shift ; Alt ; amp ; searches &amp; Ki@@ le ; after the next tabs in the adjacent line . even though this tab@@ ul@@ ator is not the added tab@@ ul@@ ator in the adjacent line .
although &amp; k@@ ate ; already offers a good source code comprehen@@ sion , it has been added in &amp; Ki@@ le to include special commands ( mostly for latex ; ) . three of them work on demand and the other two are built for automatic comprehen@@ sion . all these modes can be set up for different working modes in Settings box ... complete .
at the start of a new environment using the command \ \ begin { ambient } , &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically add the command \ \ end { environment } to an empty line ( for the text ) .
when pressing the back @-@ key , the last letter of the input is removed and it is possible to res@@ ize the complete list . on the other hand , the list can also be reduced by entering another letter .
all commands are written with a brief description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions can be removed from &amp; Ki@@ le ; alternatively , jumps can be inserted , so that a jump to these positions is possible by editing ho@@ ck marks N@@ Ã ¤ th ank@@ le and the desired parameters can then be entered .
under Settings box ; set up ... boxes ; all settings can be made to these lists . it can be used to choose different parts lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; -@@ commands as well as the qui@@ vers of the general language use .
the command mode is not useful for the execution of environments . there are always a few letters to be entered with \ \ begin and the call for complete mode will result in a large e @-@ list with environment commands . on the other hand , the environments are so often used that &amp; box ; a special mode for the complete defense of environments .
when invo@@ king the complete environment or key Alt + Shift key , the command to open the environment is automatically filled and it appears \ \ begin { . after that , the environment can be continued in the simplest way and by pressing the input button .
once this is complete , the environment is automatically closed again . once &amp; Ki@@ le ; recognizes that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command is added .
under Settings box ; set up ... boxes ; all settings can be made to these lists . this mode uses the wish list of the complete protection mode for &amp; tex ; - and latex ; -@@ commands .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; support custom lists of header extensions which are instantly replaced by longer strings . the lists can be set up under Settings box ... For example , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which for example the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
for example , if the letter L is entered and the word processing mode is initiated , or the key pressing C@@ trl + Alt Space Bar , the letter L will be replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
great e wiz@@ ards are not helpful for automatic res@@ ig@@ ning . however , it has been found that many offices are written more than once in a document . thus , &amp; Ki@@ le ; the completion for all already written documents .
this mode can be set up in the menu box ... Ki@@ le can be dep@@ rec@@ ated . here also the threshold value for the display of the complete defense can be specified .
the extension files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / box / complete / mode / the Persian home folder . mode stands for Ab@@ brevi@@ ation ( abbrevi@@ ation ) , dictionary ( W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ buch ) or tex .
the Graphic Images dialog shapes the insertion of graphics as simple as possible . to view the basics of graphics formats , the sections and notes should be considered .
PS files are not as known as PDF files but provide an excellent basis for changes and re @-@ orders of pages . if the PDF output is needed , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools and then converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf to a PDF file .
to examine the result of the work , you need to compile the source code . all construction tools are group@@ ed in groups in the menus , compilation , converting and creating view .
for comp@@ iling the source text for viewer like &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the further conversion can be used the keyboard short@@ cut Alt ; 2 . afterwards , the DVI ; file can be converted to a PS file in a PS file and be viewed by Alt ; 5 the PS file .
when using the Quick Builder command , a viewer is usually called after comp@@ iling . if no embedded viewer is used , each time a new window is opened .
a new project will be asked about the project New Project .... For this , the following information will be requested for the project :
when using the filen@@ ame window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file .
the Script function from &amp; Ki@@ le ; allows the execution of the EC@@ MA@@ script code . the scripts can be managed through scripts in the vertical bar .
the API scripts are not yet fully developed and can be changed in other versions of &amp; Ki@@ le .
first , it is necessary to say that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; Ki@@ le ; a system @-@ wide object ( = Ki@@ le ) with the following methods :
&amp; latex ; is a well @-@ developed system in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; quot ; offers a lot of different aids to support users .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; Tex@@ live ; supplied with many documents , including a documentation for the packages contained and a further and latex ; reference .
a full @-@ time Ref@@ ern@@ z for &amp; Fron@@ tex ; and for that of our friends . this is not just a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) but is therefore ideal for searching for a particular format@@ ting . as this is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; quot ; in three important book@@ marks .
due to the quantity of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; delivered , finding the right document is not always easy . as possible help offers &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k , which contains a database with all documents to &amp; Ki@@ le ; documents delivered and there@@ for a graphical surface .
all documents are sub@@ divided into categories and the most convenient advantage is the search for package names or keywords . from &amp; Ki@@ le , only the results are displayed .
double @-@ clicking with the mouse or the space bar opens the viewer for the document .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener and user @-@ friendly &amp; latex ; - / tex ; source editor , available on all systems with &amp; k@@ de installed ; &amp; k@@ de ; is also a part of the Fink project , which &amp; Ki@@ le ; also available on &amp; Mac ; with OS @-@ X installed .
many thanks to those who asp@@ ire after the continued existence of the &amp; Ki@@ le project and offer for many hours for the development of tools , which we can all use in observ@@ ance of the &amp; GNU ; license .

&amp; k@@ sig ; is a graphical editor to manage many different signatures for e @-@ mails . the signatures work in the graphical user interface of &amp; k@@ sig ; with the command line interface you create random signatures or daily signatures from a list . this command @-@ line interface provides the signatures for external e @-@ mail programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; .
for random signatures , any signature from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig ; read out . by many signatures with different quot@@ ations , styles and information , you can make your e @-@ mails varied and unique .
for day signatures , the same signature is written from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig for the whole day . for each day , use different signatures , as with the random signatures create unique e @-@ mails .
to create a new signature , select C@@ trl ; N File New . this gives you an LT ; empty Sig@@ natures ; in the Sig@@ natures section , click the &amp; lt ; empty Sig@@ natures ; and add in the lower section your new signature ; and add the signature @-@ example kon@@ qi kon@@ qi @ k@@ de@@ .org ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ k@@ de@@ .org If you have entered your signature , save it with C@@ trl ; S file Save or click the Save Disk icon .
you can create as many signatures as you like . then you have a list of signatures for e @-@ mail programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; whether you use e @-@ mails privately or professionally , there are always enough signatures .
to delete a signature , select it first and then remove it from the File menu or click the icon with the red cross Remove in the toolbar .

anyone who has worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation , knows me and how superior it is . if we raise it another piece , we give it a graphical interface ! no longer depends on a terminal ; simply cli@@ cked on the icon for the XML processor and done !
this application expects inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is located in the W@@ ed Working Fol@@ der , then leave the current job folder . if not , then remove the current job folder and specify the folder you want in the field of other folders .
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML files are deleted every time my@@ pro@@ c is started .
as I said before , everyone who has been working at the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation already knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; there is now a great graphical interface for it .
if the currently opened file is inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book , simply select the current job folder . if not , then select the current job folder and enter the folder where inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is to be found .
when it comes to an output on the screen , its file is faulty . please check the reported errors and try again .
if the file to be checked is already marked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; then the current file is simply cli@@ cked . if not , delete the check mark from the current file and select the file to be checked by other file - file selection .
if you only want to know if the file well @-@ formed is , click the well @-@ formed review selection .
to use a &amp; D@@ TD ; that is specified in the &amp; XML ; file , select &amp; D@@ TD ; ( internal ) , otherwise &amp; D@@ TD ; ( external ) and specify the location of the &amp; D@@ TD ; using Defini@@ tions @-@ UR@@ I ; file selection . both for the &amp; W3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema as well as for the Relax@@ NG review is the specification of the definition UR@@ I ; in the file selection necessary .
yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; also has a &amp; X@@ SL , processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library .
if the file to be processed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; already marked , then let the current file be selected simply . if not , remove the current file and select the file to be processed by the other file selection .
enter the name of the file as the result should have named . the file is usually stored in its home folder .
the plug @-@ ins that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; la@@ ze , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; even possibly little to do . thus , the plug @-@ in system is very powerful . you can immediately benefit from additional functionality and do not have to wait until someone uses the desired in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the plug@@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements .
to install a plugin or a part , we start with the Edit menu . this will open the following dialog :
this dialog allows to manage and add new plug@@ ins contained in it . we describe each &amp; GUI ; -@@ element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug@@ ins without a storage location , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this path for searching the plug @-@ in .
often work on a project several people in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; supports the specification of team members and they can be configured using Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the user &apos;s nick@@ name and is used for unique identification .
one member can have multiple roles in the project , such as both team leaders and sub@@ project leaders .
the user can select from the list of team members who he is . this happens by selecting the team member from the list and pressing the button S@@ etze . the currently selected member ( their identity ) appears bold after you are : text .
nick@@ names and the setting of your own identity are important with regard to messages and comments . see for further information on comments .
in addition to the overview of your team , there is another advantage by cap@@ turing the members of the team : it can be an event for information to the team leaders when something specific happens . see for further information .
event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project . an example would be the recording of opening and closing of the project so that later can be seen how much someone worked on it , or sending a message when a file is backed up , or a script that plays a file into CVS as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ;
on the event configuration page of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties dialog allows events to be created , edited and deleted .
an email is sent to the add@@ res@@ sees selected in the recipient list . the recipient can be a team or sub@@ project leader .
comments are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by following things :
to enter notes is simple . either the ann@@ ot@@ ation -@@ entry from the editor context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword can be entered in a comment text followed by ann@@ ot@@ ation text .
comments can be sent to a defin@@ able member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , with the nick@@ name of the nick@@ name of the team member , play a role in the project from the following options :
nick@@ names and roles names are independent of upper or lower case letters , but spaces around the brackets and the : make the note invalid .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a development environment for script and format@@ ting languages that is D@@ TD @-@ agnos@@ tic and supports web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages .
the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here , only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the other can be found in .
the settings can be set up by setting Qu@@ anta . this dialog extends over a number of pages that are treated one after the other .
the behaviour of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; regarding tags including car completion , can be modified .
big / Klein@@ sp@@ elling of tags : large / lower@@ case of automatically inserted tags . normal upper / lower@@ case means the tags are inserted in such a way as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
large / lower@@ case attributes : large / lower@@ case of automatically inserted attributes . normal upper / lower@@ case means the attributes are inserted in such a way as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
optional tags : if checked , for tags for which the closing tag is optional , this will be added immediately after &amp; gt ; added .
do not automatically close tags : as above for all other tags except for simple tags .
update start and end @-@ tag automatically : if enabled , the corresponding closing tag will be changed and vice versa .
automatic setting of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ ented characters into the corresponding encoding during typing .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for detection of different types of files . the default settings can be restored using the Def@@ ault button .
standard character encoding : the encoding of newly created or otherwise created files ( where the encoding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) . this setting is then exp@@ elled from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
standard D@@ TD : the selected D@@ TD is used for newly created files , or for files whose D@@ TD is not recognized . however , this setting is exp@@ elled from the same in the project features if a project is loaded .
create a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; create backup copies periodic@@ ally so that during a power ou@@ tage or crash at the next start of the program the document can be restored from this backup . this is not the same as saving the file . even for un@@ saved documents a backup is created regularly , according to the set time .
preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editor area or in a separate view ( or the documentation in a tab ) , which makes it possible to view the documentation , preview and source text at the same time .
reset the default window settings to the default when the user interface has passed through changing M@@ DI modes and / or app@@ ending / app@@ ending views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ tag command line parameter .
the warning message field is used for controlling warnings from non @-@ poll@@ ing warnings .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchronization behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source code view in divided mode .
here the par@@ ser and the structure tree representing the figure of the par@@ ser nodes in the document can be set in details .
in the mouse click on the structure tree , it is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons .
in the Struc@@ ture tree settings , the visibility of nodes in the tree can be adjusted automatically when editing and how deep in a change in the structure tree . empty nodes are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are such where no element has been found in the current document .
the area for setting abbrevi@@ ations ( a type of templates ) that will un@@ fold when editing a larger text . abbrevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; this means there can be a valid group for PHP , in which the i@@ f@@ clause abbrevi@@ ation is something else than in a group valid for Javascript .
the plug @-@ ins can be administr@@ ated here . plug @-@ ins are third @-@ party node @-@ applications , which can be re@@ used by any part @-@ enabled application , the most well @-@ known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified :
address : the path to the plugin if it is not in a standard such as $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
entry : this information will be passed to the plugin at startup , so it can open the current file , the corresponding folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
load the component in the read @-@ only mode : check if the plugin refuses to load . only read @-@ only parts usually refuse loading if this option is not selected .
check the plug @-@ in : if this is enabled , then try &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; if the entered information is correct . then , if the plugin is not available at the moment , it will be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from version 3.3 , troubleshooting was completely new . support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Deb@@ ug@@ ger was set , as well as support for the DB@@ G de@@ bu@@ gger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger plugin concept was implemented that allows different implem@@ entations via plug @-@ ins .
currently only one plugin is available , which adds support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us .
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in in the project settings . with the Options button next to the de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in sel@@ ector , the specific settings can be changed .
if a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ user interface :
a view that displays the contents of monitored variables . usually appears in the left dock .
a view in which all holding points are listed with line numbers and conditions . usually appears in the bottom dock .
a view in which the output ( as in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is shown . usually appears in the lower dock .
depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action , the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger , if required , is established , or it tells the plugin to listen to de@@ bug@@ ging requirements . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened that uses a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that in normal cases it does not have to be respected .
the counter@@ part to Deb@@ ug@@ ging session Start the session . closes the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the sounds according to requirements .
sends an HTTP request to the server to send a de@@ bug request . this is equivalent to the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this request is displayed in the Deb@@ ug@@ ger edition view .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script and send information about the monitored variables and the current line . if this happens while the script is hal@@ ted , execution continues . happens before a de@@ bug request has been started , the script starts with the request .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without sending information to monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is hal@@ ted , execution continues . if a de@@ bug request has been given , the execution starts as soon as a request is requested .
the de@@ bu@@ gger will execute the next statement in the script without entering the functions or include .
the de@@ bu@@ gger will execute the next statement in the script , and if possible , it will be corrected in functions and include .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to skip the statement and go to the next one as if there were not the current one .
opens a dialog where a variable or expression can be entered , which is to be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view .
with this dialog you can enter a variable or set a new value of a variable .

this chapter describes how you can adjust &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to your needs and how you can and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; help to become better .
document type Edi@@ ting Pack@@ ages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used to provide support for brand and scrip@@ ting languages and &amp; CSS . they enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; capabilities like car completion and node trees . their simplicity and flexibility makes off &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages respectively &amp; CSS ; . &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two file types , the tag folder and the tool@@ bars . tag folder contain two file types , the tag folder and the tool@@ bars . tag folder contain two file types , which &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and tag XML files with the extension .@@ tag@@ . Tool@@ bars are handy , symbolic tool@@ bars of thumb@@ kno@@ bs ( above the editing window ) , inser@@ ting text and instructions more quickly into a document as a user could ever .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing D@@ TD .
this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are to be created , then descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . in short , one &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the properties dialog , den &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the day shows . the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool bars allow quick insertion of tags into a document without danger of a typing error .
tag folders are nothing but folders . they only contain the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folder carries the name of the description language and version , so available . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of the tag XML and declares if it is necessary or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users can have a better insight and more information in working with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about possibilities and boundaries is explained in a simple way .
this is the root element of a tag XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains nothing else than just element type .
the type of tag is a script function . when using &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( family 2 )
valid only for the class type class . the name of the base class for this class . ( family 2 )
only valid for the method method . specifies the name of the class where this method belongs to . ( family 2 only )
if yes , the day has an common attribute group and attributes within that tag can be added to any other tag . ( family 1 )
sets a text into the dialog . this text is defined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a single element type element .
describes an attribute of a tag . this element can only be used once for each attribute . it sets the name and type of attribute . additionally , there are other tags that describe how to display this attribute &amp; etc ; This is a single element type element .
specifies the source code used to fill the attributes in tag editor dialog and attribute tree .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used to achieve source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used to achieve the source of data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a interface and a method name . the arguments passed to the method can be empty or % tag name % , which means the name of the current tag .
a container tag group@@ ing the elements of a list together . it can only happen once for an attribute description . it is an element type element .
specify the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog . this tag can occur for each attribute in a dialog only once ( e.g. once for each and lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the item is empty .
specifies the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be present for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this item is empty .
specifies a list of elements that may appear within the tag . this element is a single element type .
returns a list of elements that end a tag . this item is a single element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; -@@ declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = U@@ TF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly ch@@ ained and closed .
whit@@ esp@@ ace do not affect anything , but pay attention to &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; will be replaced . this will not cause a rup@@ ture , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to check the tag XML files , the tools dialog box at the top of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us window is to start and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . a further dialog will appear with simple instructions to follow .
this function is currently not available yet . currently , the check is performed only when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
the following is an example of a family 1 tag XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the &amp; W3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the filen@@ ame for this tag XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
the following is an example of a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the filen@@ ame of this tag XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; U@@ TF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor for it , accessible via D@@ TD editing D@@ TD settings . thus , di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created a simple &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; Version = User 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = D@@ TD . ( - / / W3@@ C ; / / D@@ TD HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name will be used as a nick@@ name .
an action can be set with settings actions ... created . click New Action leads to the same dialog :
this action assigned short@@ cuts . by clicking the user @-@ defined button , a keyboard short@@ cut can be assigned ; with K@@ 1 the current keyboard short@@ cut can be removed .
the simplest actions . a text can be entered in the detailed settings and when exec@@ uting the action , this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful type of action . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that change the document or use as input ( or parts of the document ) can be started . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; even are the quick start dialog or the different See in ... actions for ( X ) HTML D@@ TE@@ Ps .
first , the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in command line such as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . In this way , svn : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts local script folder : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ PAT@@ H There are other special variables that can be used in the command line :
% f : we are replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document , file : / from the document name is removed .
% p@@ id : is replaced with PID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; only an instance runs , the text unique is added to the PID number . this is useful if D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used by the external script .
the parameters for this event , usually the filen@@ ame of the current document , or the path to the project file .
in addition to the methods listed above , a script can be entered by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in the input field input can be determined what is to be sent to the default input . options are :
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only useful with this setting .
according to the input , the output of the executed application can also be re@@ directed . there are two types of output : normal output , written to the standard output ; error messages are directed to the standard output . it can be specified what is to happen with the text written on the default output by setting the value to the output box output :
when there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags in logical groups . it is necessary to create their own toolbar for each group . in the given case , it is not too many , so you can create a toolbar with the name of the mark@@ up .
once a toolbar has been added , you need to add and configure actions .
the parts of this window are quite self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode .
fill in all required fields and add the tag to the appropriate toolbar .
complete everything and , if the day has attributes and you plan their use , enable dialog &quot; Edit Day &quot; when available to allow an input when using the action .
Ig@@ itt ! is that an ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? let &apos;s replace it before we have trouble .
to create a symbol that better represents the action , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; choose from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Graphics more programs ( or where else it is located in your distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; uses 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels by default , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size .
please note that the created icon will not only help you remember what does the promotion , but also all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
with regard to the fact that the day starts , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green it is usually considered useless , rigid , further interpreted ) , or should at least indicate a message to the user that clicking on this symbol will insert ; start@@ led ; -@@ Tag in the current document will be inserted .
after creating the symbol , it still has to be associated with the action . this is done via the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; ) and select the desired action . next to the text field is a button , press it .
select the folder where the saved icon is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the Apply button and continue with other tags , so there are others , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; functions to the toolbar or it should be shared to a better overview by some separ@@ ators into several groups . open the toolbar to set dialog on Settings toolbar . make sure the desired toolbar is selected .
I would like to select the separ@@ ator ( at the top left ) for my toolbar . after selecting the element that is to be added to the toolbar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the item to the toolbar .
for example , I would like to have a quick way to preview the Kon@@ quer@@ or . I will select it and add it to the toolbar .
please note how the separ@@ ator supports the group@@ ing . someone who does not know my toolbar can believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button is the opposite of the start button .
the new toolbar has to be tested by twe@@ aking all symbols to make sure everything works .
after new e@@ XML does not exist , it will be created in the root folder , but your tool@@ bars ( s ) should be stored in the right folder , but your tool@@ bars ( s ) should be stored in the right folder . please adjust their descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c so that their tool@@ bars ( s ) will be loaded ( s ) when a file is opened by the corresponding type .
perhaps the most notable extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the normal user it is possible to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language you like most . that &apos;s why this chapter describes how to create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
before you start your own documentation , you might be able to check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory if someone has already done it for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to look for an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc ; -@@ language . then you need to create the doc@@ r@@ c file . we leave the first part to you , the second we will treat here .
# K@@ DE Configuration File &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = path , relative to this file , to the documentation HTML files e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # items in main index Top element = Your description for these documentation e.g. &amp; PHP ; 4.2 Docum@@ entation Section 1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html &gt; tag 1 html tag 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag 3 = tag@@ 2.@@ html
the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , you can see now in the &amp; PHP ; documentation so something :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element element element = PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Get@@ ting Star@@ ted , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = IN@@ x.@@ html Get@@ ting Star@@ ted = Intro@@ duction , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tac@@ .@@ html ...
note the # before Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the depth of chess ( except through reason ) m@@ das@@ h ; but try it yourself .
note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently at the top end of the tree view &amp; m@@ das@@ h ; folder is displayed ! ) .
whit@@ esp@@ ace do not affect anything , but pay attention to &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; resource files will be replaced .
the content section is the area of the doc@@ r@@ c file , which is used to create context sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP script , the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function is to be displayed . the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Con@@ text@@ List ) and the file connection lines .
a simple list of contex@@ tual elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can easily save your doc@@ r@@ c file to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc for local and global use . then create a folder ( as you specified it in your doc@@ r@@ c file ) in the same folder as doc@@ r@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there .
if you are sure that they are good and worth sharing , send your doc@@ r@@ c files with a description of important information such as which documentation has been used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory . you will not be rich , but proud to have worked with the best web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the scattered resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
resources can be sent via email to friends , partners , or anyone else . in different places there is an email @-@ send menu entry , such as D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , toolbar menu of files and folders in the templates and in the script tree .
the resources can be uploaded into our main archive from where all other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ users can download them . the contributions are checked and only made available if our team considers them to be correct and useful for publication . to make a more detailed contribution , we recommend to sign the resources for which it needs a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . thus , the source of resources is ensured , both for our team and for the later users .
when up@@ loading you will be asked for their pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase for their private G@@ PG key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event that you have several keys , you can choose one . in the New resource dialog , the input fields must be filled ( URL preview can remain empty ) and clicking OK to start up@@ loading .
upload can be uploaded from the D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , upload toolbar , and start from the context menu of files and folders in the template and script tree .
after downloading a resource , before installation , expl@@ ores &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and marking . in case of problems it warns and it can then be abor@@ ted . if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed , a message appears indicating the source of the resource .
it is possible to work on XML languages currently not yet supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; it is time consuming , because hundreds of tag files can be needed in tag@@ XML format . there is the easiest way to convert D@@ TD into a D@@ TE@@ P package automatically .
the conversion can be started from the D@@ TD menu and converting a D@@ TD . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the D@@ TD description which is to be used . after that the following dialog appears :
destination directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name to the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
Doc@@ type Defini@@ tions line : the string that appears in ! Doc@@ type tag , such as HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W3@@ C / / D@@ TD HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e@@ .d@@ t@@ d
fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if enabled , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; after converting the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; there are some key concepts . to understand them and to draw full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , one must first famili@@ ari@@ ze oneself with these fundamental concepts . this chapter tries to explain these concepts to them precisely without their understanding and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; little benefit .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the working area is divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
global elements are available for everyone who uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; everything that is marked as global is stored in the shared folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this allows the group of administrators to secure different tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree that are then available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment on the system .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user &apos;s directory , so that they can only use that user personally .
project @-@ related elements are available only within a particular project . this can be anything from &amp; CSS ; patterns to tool@@ bars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project . simply , this is the most limited size . all elements are placed in the folder tree of the project , which em@@ bodies the common use of special tools and samples from all employees within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of several main areas : the editor window , the construction supervis@@ ors , the tabs with information and the tool@@ bars .
you can click the tab with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document , re@@ charge , delete or upload the document , jump to a book@@ mark or run CVS commands to the current document .
right @-@ click in the editor pane will lead to a further context menu with regard to the edited document content , such as basic editing steps ( cut / copy / paste ) , editing the text under the mouse @-@ cursor , or opening the file , if the string is called a file under the mouse poin@@ ter .
at the top of the editor window are the editors of the editor . currently , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional is the standard for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and associated user needs .
the use of tool bars is really easy . if you want to insert a single day , e.g. &amp; lt ; paste into your document , then click on the icon that the tag represents . now you can paste the data for this just inserted tag . if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes ( such as anch@@ ors ) , you can fill in a dialog with different fields .
the installation views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow you to navigate in the information to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to navigate , open it and strip them . in the presentation with tabs available for files , project , sample templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation tree views .
project management is a powerful tool that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; provides . this view displays all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by right clicking . actions such as adding , removing , up@@ loading or del@@ eting the files from the storage medium can be done using the contex@@ tual menu that appears .
another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc .
templates can be divided into three categories depending on what context they are used . the category depends on &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the category depends on the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; global templates are always available , local templates for the respective users and templates in projects can only be used in the project .
here you can find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . clicking with the left mouse button will allow you to retrieve the available information about a script . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can access the available information to a script . by clicking the right mouse button , more functions are available , such as start , edit or email the script .
with this view , the internal structure of the active document is displayed . by clicking on an element the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking on an element , a list of commands in relation to navigation and refres@@ her of the tree opens .
this tree appears under the other tree views . with it , it can quickly change attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces . the entry system aligned to the content allows the change of all available attributes with just a few mouse clicks .
here is the complete documentation on the web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &apos; documentation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project , project @-@ specific documentation can be app@@ ended , edited and viewed .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; two tabs at the bottom of the window , can be accessed via the useful information : the message window and the problem window .
this tab displays information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used D@@ TD is displayed in the current document and all changes to the D@@ TD .
this tab shows all errors in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ scripts , which are executed , give all error messages ( as there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; toolbar buttons are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they get the corresponding command . the chocolate side of the toolbar is the possibility to define your own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the ability to send a toolbar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; sends the toolbar as compressed T@@ ar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; . if you receive a toolbar in an email , you can save and load them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; like any other tool !
it is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; files on your system . therefore , auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help . the options are simple to understand and not executed here .
if you have problems starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that is not an older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in PAT@@ H in front of her bin folder . the same goes for &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a web development tool for K@@ DE desktop . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
while trying to create the best &amp; HTML editor , developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us began to deal with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; a stand@@ alone , exp@@ and@@ able mark@@ up language editor would ? well , this would make it the absolute most powerful web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer confined to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; now well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summari@@ zed : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for this the appropriate &amp; IDE ; be .
well , to the above claim must be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the whole &amp; k@@ de ; developer community based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; follow , in good application of free software , the idea of why develop what someone else has developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding not only this is possible , but it allows users and developers to expand as they need it for their needs .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; allows web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document interface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can dramatically increase productivity . by using self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation is almost every task possible . by using self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation can be increased almost every task . by using self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation can be expanded without having to mem@@ ori@@ ze any script language syntax . ( find more about it in . )
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development and was quickly expanded to a sophisticated editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta . the original developers left the GP@@ L licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more detailed documentation is available with help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or k@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and supervised by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files that you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not located on it , and the oldest entry is taken out .
this allows you to save code pieces and whole files as templates for later use . look in the section on templates . if you try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only one error is reported .
converts special characters to &amp; HTML when inser@@ ting from the clip@@ board , so they display correctly and do not mis@@ understand them as format@@ ting instructions .
converts the text from the clip@@ board into &amp; URL ; -@@ sp@@ elling which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . primarily to insert &amp; URL ; s used in the anchor tag .
switches the block selection to or off . this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift key .
go directly to a line number . this is very helpful when your PHP and PHP script prints error messages !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and predefined expression to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window where you can see the display of the script actions and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
check and turn on the problem repor@@ ter at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window . the problem repor@@ ter is activated as soon as you switch to the structure tree .
displays the toolbar left from the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a click of the mouse .
if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with the entries Previous or Next , depending on the cursor location in the document .
book@@ marks from other open documents appear group@@ ed in the menu according to the filen@@ ame of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard drive . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ projects are stored with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
searches the project directory for new files that might be there . this allows you to copy graphics files into your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project .
upload the files in your project to the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and if you have downloaded more input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
settings , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the project manages . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ projects you will find the details .
loads a project toolbar . these are kept in project / tool@@ bars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your toolbar . allows you to select the type of toolbar : local or project .
opens a dialog to add a new toolbar . this only creates the name . actions must be saved by setting actions ... Save operations by means of toolbar tool bars or you will be asked if you want to save the toolbar .
removes a toolbar from the field of view . this does not delete them from the disk . if you haven &apos;t saved the toolbar , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do that .
this allows you to send your own toolbar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; team so that the toolbar is present in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as an attachment .
enables up@@ loading of tool bars to the main server , where everyone else can access it .
load a &amp; D@@ TD ; you or anyone else has made and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; own description format .
load / refresh the entities from the &amp; D@@ TD ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P need to be refres@@ hed without renew@@ ing the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and a write permission is not present in the global K@@ DE folder , the load fails .
this menu contains a list of tags available in the currently loaded toolbar . if the standard ( HTML ; ) toolbar is loaded , there is a sub@@ menu item in the Tags menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar .
allows access to the current day preferences dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in the Tags menu , followed by &amp; D@@ TD ; -@@ specific sub @-@ menus .
active or de@@ activates the intelligent insertion of tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML D@@ T@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ ting means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; inser@@ ting using toolbar until this day contradic@@ ts the rules .
in the plug @-@ in menu , the available plug@@ ins are listed under the above @-@ mentioned menu items . click on it . click on an activated plug @-@ in de@@ activates it .
sel@@ ects the syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schemes depends on the k@@ ate ; -@@ version .
choose the type of line end identi@@ fier . very useful when you know people using other OS platforms to develop . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
checks the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; D@@ TD ; using the external application ti@@ dy .
immediate switching between the different types of user interface . by some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , switching can sometimes take time or cause un@@ nice graphics . recommended is the card map mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode that corresponds to the display in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu contains an entry for each open sub@@ window . selecting an entry will activate the corresponding sub@@ window .
enables the status bar to be displayed at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window on or off .
changes in this dialog will affect any application that uses the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser .
defines the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of &amp; k@@ ate ; find details .
a dialog appears where you can delete entries from the toolbar or add which ones and change the sequences .
this should generate a help in line with the mouse poin@@ ter environment , but is not implemented yet .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if you want to support &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; development in financial form , you can find the way here .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should preferably be filled from top to bottom , since the entire directory structure for the rest of the project is completed automatically after filling the project name . all of these paths and author information fields can later be set using Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties .
here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name , file will be filled in automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; project file . by default it has the name of the project in lower@@ case and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can enter the server address of the machine to which you want to access , except you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exempl@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
if you leave this field blank , the default settings of the selected protocol will be used . depending on the remote host configuration , an adjustment could be necessary .
this is the folder where the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and custom templates . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder where the tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and tool@@ bars by default . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this allows to include files from the local fil@@ esystem to the project . multiple files or whole folders can be selected .
this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . for server @-@ side scripts ( e.g. , PHP , , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently .
checked if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be included . if a project is started from scratch , do not tick .
with this option , all files and folders within the main folder will be displayed and you can make an exact selection of goo@@ dies .
this shows a list of the files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by hook or by removing the tick from the project .
the last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be changed in the menu with project project properties in the sub @-@ window profiles , or modified using Shift ; F@@ 7 .
some settings correspond to those in the project assistant and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of file names ( plac@@ eholders possible ) that are ignored in project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
additional option to top , also files that are listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore are excluded from the project .
the project view loaded when the project is opened . you can read more about project views .
this allows you to select the desired de@@ bu@@ gger . currently only gu@@ bed is supported . more information about gu@@ bed can be found in . the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin can be set using the Options button .
in the Pro@@ files window , upload profiles ( see in ) can be set , as well as displaying a tree view for the content of the server for each profile by pointing an own tree view for each profile .
in the sub @-@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details .
in the event configuration window , you can turn on event actions and add , change or delete actions . event actions are executed when a pre @-@ determined event occurs , such as the saving of a file . see the details .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us opens ; the last project that was opened . this behavior cannot be influenced at present .
to open another project , select Open Project ... from the Project menu or the Save Project menu from the toolbar . the Open Project dialog is displayed and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension .
when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; closed , the project file is saved automatically . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project .
the project tree view gives free access to the files in the project . there the files can be managed in the current project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; folders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; behave as well , but the opening and opening entries are missing ... in the context menu called with the right mouse button : &quot; &quot; &quot;
different profiles can be selected here . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files .
allows removal of the current profile . if only one profile is present , the button is bl@@ ended to prevent the removal .
the password will be kept in the core memory and forgotten at the end of the program . this option is useful when frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary and the rather in@@ secure password on the disk cache option does not come into question .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog when you change your mind before up@@ loading .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; many high @-@ load profiles can be created and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed :
this is the server name on which the files should be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for upload . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least , you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs .
the port for the transfer . normally this does not have to be changed except the network administrator does not run a service on the usual port .
depending on your anxiety shaft this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use it at your discretion . the password is stored on the disk , so that it cannot be read , but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text .
a project view is only one set of files and tool@@ bars . there can be many views in a project , i.e. , by simply de@@ porting the view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars .
views can be saved , opened or deleted from the Project Tool@@ bar menu or project toolbar .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; with which one has the most to do . this not only helps increase productivity but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to the own way of working .
as already mentioned above are tool@@ bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; best custom@@ is@@ able using the toolbar . use and add differ . adding tool bars is discussed below in the section Add of Tool@@ bars .
the toolbar and the symbols on it can be set either by context menu ( right click on the toolbar ) , in which the New Action , a New toolbar can be created , other actions such as tool@@ bars can be removed , the toolbar can be changed , where specified , which actions should be visible on this or other toolbar .
by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a toolbar , the entries will be removed and action lab@@ ored , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the toolbar and the actions on them can be set up in the menu with Settings toolbar ... and specify actions .. are set .
templates are basically document skel@@ et@@ ons , code cut@@ lets and files for linking . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; basically uses templates like a common fil@@ esystem with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , shift or associate any existing directory into the template tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in about the limitations you imagine for the fil@@ esystem .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use .
binary is everything that is not pure text . it can be any file except text , i.e. images , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; binary templates are usually included in documents using short@@ cuts ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the template tree among global templates .
documents can be of any text document type . on the basis of these templates new documents can be created . usually , more specific documents can be created in appropriate sub@@ folders . it makes a simple framework for the purpose and organizes the work in an appropriate way to be efficient . some examples may be found in the template tree among global templates . see for more information about the template tree .
this kind of template is useful if not a new document based on a template but the same text area should be inserted into the documents again and again . you can find everything from a comment about a final note to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl basis . some examples are available in the template tree below global templates . see for more information about the template tree .
as the name says , these templates serve as templates for whole websites . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , summari@@ zed in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
design a document structure as desired ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and choose File As a template Save As Local Tem@@ plate ....
once this is done , notice that ( even though it has been saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look in the template tree under project templates .
select text in your document and click Save As a template to save your selection as a local / project template . alternatively , the selection can be simply drag@@ ged and placed on the tree view templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be copied to a template folder . it can be used for all file management functions , such as drag@@ ging and inser@@ ting or inser@@ ting the file tree from Kon@@ quer@@ or .
in the file tree or in the project file , you can click a folder on the right and select site template , enter a name for the template and secure it . by default , it is backed up in the project folder , but of course it can be saved as a local or global template .
project templates allow a very goal @-@ oriented approach . you can pre@@ tend he@@ aders and foot@@ ers , or dynamically with &amp; PHP ; design , insert or associate with them . additionally , you can keep a few things in mind when using templates in projects .
the template structure in the sub@@ window Tem@@ plates is based on the files placed in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates . each of these folders is one of four types of containers as explained above .
to set the behavior of a folder , click the folder with the right mouse button and select Properties from the context menu . the following dialog appears :
a selection field with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is da@@ zz@@ led once par@@ ental attributes are corrupted .
this is enabled by default and fits everything except the root folders in the template list . if a regular folder is set , it would disable templates in this path except they would be explicitly enabled . in case of a normal folder , the bla@@ h would appear with something like text module . if nothing appears , you probably find yourself in a root folder .
allows previous or im@@ printed text templates for templates in this folder . this could be general he@@ aders or foot@@ ers for all templates for a specific project and allows you to copy content templates into a folder with custom he@@ aders / foot@@ ers for a whole presentation with the appropriate he@@ aders / foot@@ ers .
in addition , by using context menu ( pointing to right mouse button ) , you have a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and inser@@ ting templates from one location to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; provides two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; Source editor , which can be accessed through the View menu . the first mode replaces the source text editor by the V@@ PL ; editor and the second divi@@ des the editor window into two parts : the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ page and a cursor . then you can edit and switch back to the source editor if required , in which the changes made in the V@@ PL ; editor in the source code are visible .
when working with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor in a document that &amp; PHP ; contains , a small green symbol shows the default of &amp; PHP ; source code . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; editor . to edit and PHP , the source text editor is still necessary . there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works just like the first one , except that at the same time the changes are visible in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor , this mode is already active , the ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ ke moves the active cursor from one window to another , while maintaining the position in the document .
the synchronization interval between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source text editor can be set up via settings Qu@@ anta . by choosing V@@ PL ; you can choose between synchron@@ isation by one click or automatically . in principle , the time interval can be set automatically . in principle , the recommendation : a small span for fast computers and a large span for slow computers .
assuming you want to change the title of the website , the tool is able to select document properties . this makes it possible to edit invisible tags when working with the V@@ PL ; editor . the document properties dialog is also called as soon as a new document is created using the V@@ PL ; editor . this is used to reduce the manual coding . this allows you to change the following :
met@@ a tags allow storing information about the document itself e.g. keywords for internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . a click on the list allows to change the content , e.g. key words on the column name and keyword key word 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way of creating pages in your browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons under the list . editing CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS sty@@ ling template by pressing the File Open button and selecting the appropriate file .
using the cursor is possible as in word processing , because of moving with the arrows . under rare circumstances , the cursor beha@@ ves especi@@ al . the mark functions as usual . text can be inserted by typing and deleted by button or distance key .
inser@@ ting tags is done in the same way via the toolbar , as in the source text editor . note that inser@@ ting tags previously already existing identical tags will not be removed e.g. when an anchor tag , surrounded by text , must be removed any other ar@@ mature tag .
some toolbar buttons such as the She@@ ets Assistant or the Listen Assistant are disabled . you will later work in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists need to be used tool@@ bars .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the study of style sheets . unlike other styles for style sheets , searching for certain elements is possible and the style template can be followed .
to compile and compile successfully , you need besides &amp; k@@ de ; the libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and lib@@ x@@ ml which are already available for a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de .
hold in a template , in a place in a style or x@@ ml file loaded by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g or at the current node . new in x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in g@@ db compatibility mode , orph@@ aned support points can be set in a specific file and line number and later enabled .
x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g determines the complete path from a filen@@ ame without path specification . file names in the same folder as the top loaded style file filen@@ ame with relative path to the working folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g is , for example , a style template file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l , the following input is possible :
in this command , a partial or complete match with a vag@@ ue named my@@ ME or a specified model name will be reviewed . &amp; eg ; template matches any QNA@@ P@@ template containing the template template .
each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; QNAP &quot; will be extended according to the rules defined by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file . x@@ s@@ l : test@@ 1 will be &amp; eg ; extended to ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 199 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a scheduled holding point must be resolved for the corresponding UR@@ I and line number . this will be automatically performed when the first template is loaded using x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g .

there are many graphical tools to compare . why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me briefly explain why I wrote .
the merge was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors had made many changes and at the same time corrected the ind@@ entation at many places . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result was numerous conflicts when mer@@ ging .
the program I used showed me only the changed lines , but I could not see what exactly happened within these lines . and there was no indication of the places where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . mer@@ ging these changes was a small night@@ mare .
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could show differences within one line and changes to white characters . later , a lot of other useful functions have been added .
for example , if you want to compare text quickly , simply copy it to the clip@@ board and insert it in one of the comparative windows .
a function that made a lot of work was comparing and mer@@ ging folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full file browser .
also 3 @-@ way merge is fully supported . this is useful when two people work independently of each other on a piece of code and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in this editor you can even edit the result directly . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . the screen@@ shot shows three source files when mer@@ ging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you compare and merge entire folders . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in folder mer@@ ging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and deals with the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you frequently need to check code , you will like this function .
differences in white characters and tabs are displayed visi@@ bly . if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters , you can see this at a glance at the summary in the column on the left . ( no more trouble if somebody changes the ind@@ entation . )
if a file is equal and the other differs in one line then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both are different .
if all files have the same name but are in different folders , then you can ease the typing work by completely writing the file name of the first file . for example :
K@@ diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder 2 k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 3 folder
the opening dialog allows manual typing of file names , selecting a file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a last opened file from the drop @-@ down list . the opening dialog registers your selection and displays it again next time . you do not need to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C empty , the analysis of the differences with two files is performed .
over the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the comparing and mer@@ ging of folders will be initiated . if a file is selected for A , for B and C a folder is then used &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the filen@@ ame from A in the other two folders .
when mer@@ ging is checked , the input field is activated for target and can be edited . however , it is not necessary to immediately set a output file . you can also do this step later when saving .
the Setup button opens a dialog with Settings . here you can set options before starting to merge / merge .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to drag text parts from the clip@@ board into the active comparative window . the comparison begins immediately . in the Open dialog you do not need to select files , you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel button .
you can also use drag and drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window .
what idea is behind it ? sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar to these functions , it would be a relatively big effort . you first need to create two corresponding files , load them in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; load them and then compare them . now you can simply copy , paste and then compare the relevant sections .
note : currently , you can &apos;t remove anything from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; just extract the dropping of text into a comparative window .
warning : some editors interpret the drawing and dropping of text into another program as cut and paste ( instead of copy and paste ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost .
in the upper part of each text window is the info line . the info line of the source pane contains the characters A , B or C , the filen@@ ame and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) Each Info line has a different color . ( if the path is too long , leave the mouse over the line for a while . then a small auxiliary window will show the full name . )
the three spring fingers are assigned the letters A , B and C . A has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these preferences can be changed via the Settings menu . )
if a difference is detected , one sees the color , which file differs . if both files differ , the default color for it is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files . that &apos;s good to see in the next section ( merge ) .
in addition to the text there is the summary column . if differences are found , the color displays the corresponding color . in some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( for C / C + + , for example , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in rare , rare cases . )
the vertical line separating the summary column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no lines . if the line breaks are activated , the line is dotted with broken lines .
the result window ( among the comparative windows ) also has an info line with the title Output : , the filen@@ ame and &#91; changes &#93; if you edited the result . usually it contains text , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! until all conflicts are resolved , saving is disabled ! ! ! ( use the Jump to next resolved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two comparative windows are used , any difference at the same time is also a conflict that needs to be solved manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in the assembly column in one of the windows the group belonging to the row will be selected in all windows and the first row of the group will be displayed . ( this will also highlight a jump of position in the windows , where the beginning of the group would otherwise not be visible . ) This group will then be highlighted with the color background color for current area and each on the left appears a black bar .
sometimes by automatic mer@@ ging or by manual editing , no further line remains in the group ; then in these lines the text &amp; lt ; no row in the queue ; displayed . this text appears neither in the final saved file , nor in a marker that you may copy and paste elsewhere .
the text &amp; lt ; merge conflict ; however , appears in the clip@@ board if you copy such text from the result window . be careful with this function .
note : if the sources ignore the numbers or ignore Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white characters .
navigate up mainly with the scroll bars and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in any of the windows , you can use the arrow keys left , right , high , down , side up , side from , beginning , end , C@@ trl @-@ beginning and C@@ trl @-@ end , Si@@ v as you can also use it from other programs .
in the preview window , you can also use the other buttons to edit . with the insertion button you can switch between insert and over@@ write mode . ( pres@@ et is the insert mode . )
a click with the left mouse button in one of the sum@@ m@@ aries synchron@@ izes the view of all windows at the beginning of each group ( as explained in the Con@@ fusion section and the edi@@ table output window ) .
the toolbar contains seven buttons for navig@@ ating with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ trl @-@ picture Up@@ ward / Str@@ g @-@ picture down@@ wards ) or to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ trl @-@ picture Up@@ ward / Str@@ g @-@ picture down@@ wards ) or to the next / previous conflict .
to copy the marker to the clip@@ board , you need to press the Copy button ( C@@ trl @-@ C or C@@ trl @-@ In@@ sert ) . it also gives the option Sel@@ ection Automati@@ cally . if this is enabled , whatever you select is automatically copied to the clip@@ board and the manual copy is om@@ itted . be careful with this option , because you could accidentally over@@ ride the contents of the clip@@ board .
line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a line feed character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems do not use carriage return + new@@ line feed \ \ r \ . K@@ NO@@ 3 does not keep the line ending of the source files , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not with bin@@ aries .
the options and the list of the last used files will be saved automatically during the next start and restored at the next start . ( menu Set@@ ting - &gt; K@@ NO@@ 3 set up ... )
select a font with fixed width . ( on some systems the dialog also displays fonts with variable width to choose from , but you should not use them . )
if you enable this option , differences are displayed in itali@@ c font . if the chosen script does not support this representation , nothing happens at all .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form , but would be rendered ast@@ ert . on these systems , the button Pre@@ ferences automatically introduces an odd color .
if this option is checked , the corresponding number of spaces is inserted when the Tab key is pressed . otherwise , a tab character is inserted .
if you press Enter or Return , the ind@@ entation of the previous line will be automatically applied to the next line .
when this option is checked , each selection is automatically copied to the clip@@ board . the manual copy to the clip@@ board is then om@@ itted .
you can select which line type you prefer to save . the default value is the generally usual selection on the operating system used .
when comparing files , &amp; k@@ vili@@ 3 ; first , all completely identical lines can be found in the source files . only during this first step white characters can be ignored . the second step compar@@ es each line . in this step white characters are ignored . even when mer@@ ging white characters are ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) save a carriage return character &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a line feed &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , others save only a line feed &apos; \ &apos; . usually ignored &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , but then files with different sizes in the side @-@ to @-@ side comparison will appear visible , but then they might be disabled with different sizes in the page @-@ to @-@ side comparison , but then this option has to be disabled . in default , this option is disabled .
in the default , this option is de@@ activated . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . as a result , the differences are still displayed , but they are treated as white characters .
by default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters .
search for even smaller differences . the option is enabled by default . it is effective for complicated and large files , but slow on very large files .
in auto @-@ skip mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict is j@@ umped .
automatically triggers all conflicts in white characters using the selected file as a source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful when white characters in many files are less important . if you need this only from time to time , then use better the features Cho@@ ose A / B / C for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the merge menu . note that the automatic selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments when options ignore numbers or ignore Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments .
these options are discussed in the chapter on the scanning of folders and exec@@ uting a merge . look for details under documentation on the directory comparison and merge .
if a file is saved and an older version already exists , then the original version will be app@@ ended to suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if such a backup file exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further backup .
adjust the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the current program . you need to change &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; exit and restart to make the change active . ( this option is available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set global over the control center . )
the following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry . if you enable this option , the upper setting is used for all entries .
the encoding area for the encoding appears a short note of what the local coding is . ( this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character . )
adjust the file encoding for source files . this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted . since encoding for each file is individually adjustable , even files with different encoding can be compared and merged .
if you have edited a file , you can specify which encoding should be used for saving .
if you define pre @-@ processing commands , they might not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files might be 16 @-@ bit uni@@ code , but the default command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can set the encoding of the output of pre @-@ processing commands .
turn this off to supp@@ ress high@@ lighting of changes in white characters in text or review columns . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments when options ignore numbers or ignore Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are displayed in a color co@@ ded overview column . but sometimes you may want to see only the differences between two of three files . by selecting A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C will appear next to the normal yet another over@@ wie@@ v column with the information you need .
sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines . just exit the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes you view the differences and then decide suddenly to merge the files . merge the current file in the merge menu , and then use the file name of the last source file as pres@@ et name for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart the merge , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . )
when reading a file , it will first pass this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , then the output of the command becomes visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre @-@ processor that matches your needs . you can use this function , for example , to cut extran@@ eous parts or to correct the ind@@ entation .
when reading a file , it will first pass this external command . if a normal pre @-@ processing command has been specified ( see above ) , the output of the command is the input of this command line . you can write your own pre @-@ processing command that corresponds exactly to your needs . each input line must have a corresponding output line .
the idea behind this is to allow the user more flexibility to set up the Di@@ ff results . however , an external program is needed and most users do not want to program it themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l suff@@ ice completely .
use this command line command for line ab@@ ort to convert the input into upper@@ case letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 1 / &apos; The \ \ 1 in the replacement string refers to the found text in the first log pair . the \ \ U converts the found text into upper@@ case .
the \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you experiment with sed , you might begin to understand it and maybe you might like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ NO@@ 3 . but it is good as an example of another pre @-@ processing command for line ab@@ ut@@ es. sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Each sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and every hit is replaced by nothing , so it is virtually deleted .
sometimes you might want to perform several replac@@ ements at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the replac@@ ements from each other . for example :
instead of sed you can also use something else like per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / replace / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos; How@@ ever , per@@ l needs some details . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) requires , per@@ l needs only ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal pre@@ processor are retained for displaying and mer@@ ging . the subsequent operations only change the data that the line ab@@ ode al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ m sees .
note : in rare cases when using a normal pre@@ processor , the new@@ line processor will see the output of the normal Pre@@ processor as input .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hides differences , you may accidentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data .
often programmers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge entire folders recur@@ sively .
... makes a suggestion for mer@@ ging for each object ; you can adjust the proposal before starting ,
... can simulate the merge and display the simul@@ ated changes without actually carrying out it ,
... performs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with the selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to comparing and mer@@ ging individual files . you just need to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog file .
when three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as the base . if no destination folder is specified , used &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as destination folder .
note that only the comparison of folders starts automatically , not the merge . to start mer@@ ging , you need to select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( see more details . )
while reading the folder , you will inform a small news window of the current progress . if you cancel the scan of the folder , only the files that have been compared will be listed .
when scanning the folder is finished , it shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left ...
each file and folder found during the scan is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually folded together . you can open a folder by double @-@ clicking on the + / - or by double clicking on the + / - or by double @-@ clicking the arrow keys for left / right . the directory menu contains two functions Select All sub@@ directories and open all sub@@ directories with which you can open or un@@ fold all folders .
when you double @-@ click a file , the comparison window is started and a comparison window appears .
the name in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders , this is visible in the A / B / C columns and the details pane to the selected object . in such a case the merge action cannot be automatically selected . if the merge operation is started , you will be informed about problems of this type .
as shown in the picture above , the colors red , green , yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C .
with identical entries the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different .
folders are considered iden@@ tically if their entire content is identical . then folders also have the same color . in folders the age is in@@ significant for its color .
the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ diff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf which is only green , then yellow and later when it is old , red .
... A and C are identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , er@@ ase the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical , but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , er@@ ase the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical , but not A : copy A ( or if A does not exist , er@@ ase the target if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same type of file ( e.g. if A a folder and B is a file ) : errors : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such faulty objects exist , mer@@ ging cannot be started .
... A and B do not have the same type of file ( e.g. if A a folder and B is a file ) : errors : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such defective objects exist , mer@@ ging cannot be started .
the synchron@@ izing mode is active if only two folders and no explicit target folder were specified and if the option synchron@@ izes directories . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then select the necessary action so that both folders are identical . if for one entry ...
... A and B exist but are not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible file name for the output file only B ; copied &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
when two folders are merged and the option New file instead of merge select ( unsure ) is enabled , then expl@@ ores &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of the files and suggests the newer file to copy . if the files are different , but the date is identical . if such errors are not removed , the merge of the folders cannot be started .
while mer@@ ging , one file is processed after the other . you status column shows Fer@@ tig if the merge was successful , and accordingly other messages when something unexpected occurred . if the merge is completed , you should make a final check and check if the status is all right .
if in the setup dialog the file comparison method is selected Full Analysis , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display additional columns . these contain the number of un@@ resolved , deleted , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged . )
you can either merge the just selected entry ( file or odds ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the merge actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start mer@@ ging .
please note : if you have not specified a destination folder , C will be used as a destination in the three @-@ folder mer@@ ging mode . B is chosen as the target while synchron@@ izing A and / or B as the target .
if you have selected a destination folder , please check whether all entries should be in the destination folder , even in the folder structure . there are some options to skip through certain entries . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises :
to merge all entries : select start / continue directory merge / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the keyboard short@@ cut ) . to only merge the current item : select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if the conflic@@ ting file types still exist invalid merge actions , a message appears that indicates the defective elements . you can then select a valid action for them .
when you merge all entries , a dialog box will appear with the Browse options , simul@@ ating and Cancel .
select Sim@@ ulate if you want to see what would happen without actually making any changes . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; performs certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a merge window opens ( note the screen@@ shot ) .
when you are finished with a file , select again directory merge / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved yet , a corresponding dialog will appear . then , &amp; k@@ de@@ 3 will continue ; its work will continue with the next entry .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; click on a bug , a message appears and detailed status information . at the end of the list , you will see some error messages that will help you to choose the cause of the problem . if you continue to merge ( F@@ 7 key ) , lets you choose another action for the entry or solve the problem in a different way before you proceed with mer@@ ging .
if some entries have been merged individually , these entries ( in the current session ) will not be merged . even if the merge has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries will be considered finished . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged .
the Pre@@ ferences menu from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu Set@@ ting - &gt; Set Def@@ ault ... ) now has a section called directory merge with these options :
only files matching the given pattern are displayed in the element tree . you can enter multiple patterns . separate the patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders must not match this pattern .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as a separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as a separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
ignore files that would also be ignored by CVS . many aut@@ mati@@ cally generated files are ignored by CVS . the big advantage is that this folder @-@ specific file can be set with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some fil@@ es@@ ystems , files have a default attribute . in other file systems , a previous point marks a file than hidden . this option lets you decide if these files should be displayed in the El@@ em@@ ental Tree or not . this option is switched on in default .
in case of links to files : if the option is switched off , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files are compared to which the links point . this is down@@ lighted in default .
when the option is switched off , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is turned on , the links will be treated as normal folders and recur@@ sively scanned . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , which contains a link to itself , would result in an infinite loop and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; crashes . ) This option is disabled in default .
performs a complete analysis of each file and displays the statisti@@ c columns . ( the number of deleted , un@@ resolved , non@@ - white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files that do not contain any text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare large folders over a slow network , it may be faster to compare only the modification date and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain amount of security . please use caution with caution . this option is switched off in default .
similar to the date of change . there is no real comparison . the files are considered identical if they are equal to size . this can be useful , for example , when copying the modification date . please use caution with caution . this option is switched off in default .
enables synchron@@ izing mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder is specified . in this mode , the suggestions for mer@@ ging are selected so that afterwards both folders are identical . also the results of mer@@ ging files are stored in both folders . this option is switched off in default .
if there are differences , the copying of the newer file is suggested as an action . ( this is considered un@@ safe because it is assumed that the other file has not been modified too . you should check this in any case . ) This option is disabled in default .
if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , then the original version will be renamed and the extension .@@ orig@@ . If an old backup file with the .@@ ori@@ g extension already exists , it will be deleted without further backup . this also applies to the normal mer@@ ging of single files , not just the mer@@ ging of entire folders . this option is turned on in default .
normally , the folder mer@@ ging view remains visible during the merge of single files ; you can move the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want it , you can switch off the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want this , you can switch off main window in the window menu and switch between the directory &amp; text window between the two views .
you can also merge a single file directly without having to start the folder mer@@ ging . you can also merge a single file directly without having to start the folder mer@@ ging . as soon as you save the result , the status will be saved and the file will not be merged once you start the folder mer@@ ging .
however , this status is lost when you re @-@ read the directory : directory menu : re @-@ read
K@@ DE supports network transparency with K@@ IO slaves . K@@ NO@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders to open , located on local or remote machines .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file to an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders . you should note a few things :
a path can be relative and@@ . or .. contained . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute .
special characters must be escaped . ( # - &gt; % 23 , empty string &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # has the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes because of the fil@@ esystem on the server , sometimes using the protocol . it follows a short list of limitations :
or it cannot be distinguished whether a link shows a file or folder . then a file is always assumed to be a link target . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no way to edit permissions or modification dates . therefore , the permissions or the modification date devi@@ ate from the original . ( please refer to the Con@@ fi@@ denti@@ al of the size . ) ( This is possible only for local files . )
the main purpose of use is currently the differences viewer in K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP . K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP always starts the built @-@ in difference viewer . to start K@@ DE@@ 3 , press the right mouse button above the Differ@@ ent Viewer and then select In K@@ Def@@ 3@@ Part from the contex@@ tual menu .
usually requires &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . if it is used as a node , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; specify the name of the original files from the patch file . at least one of the files must exist . at least one of the files must exist . then starts &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the patch program to restore the missing file .
in the Kon@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select it from the context menu Pre@@ view in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work unless the original files have changed since the patch file was created .
when &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; executed as part , it only supports comparing two files , a very small toolbar and menu . mer@@ ging or comparing folders is not supported in the node mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Def@@ 2 ( now called pare ) already exist . furthermore , the name K@@ NO@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge as the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff Tool collection .
I have been using GP@@ L programs for a long time and learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all programmers who have gone this way or they will go that way .
you compiled the program from the sources and probably didn &apos;t tell the configure script to K@@ DE . in default configure installed configure in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE inst@@ alls the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this topic .
if only the number of white characters varies , the lines will first be treated as identical , but if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line will be treated as not identical . i@@ F similar lines are next to each other , this is the right purpose . this is often the case .
the editor notes for any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . this is necessary to easily resolve a conflict by clicking in the source text and selecting the button A / B / C . this important information is lost though the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to create extra a separate file format that could store this information .
the effort required was so far too big . you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C . in order to process larger amounts of text another editor should be used .
after removing text is suddenly healed ; no sr@@ c swe@@ eps ; appeared and the text cannot be deleted . what does it mean and how can that be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; used already many colors to highlight differences . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using and missing the purpose . please use another editor .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ def@@ 3 ; you need to use &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later .
information on how to use K@@ Def@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
a list of recent changes can be found under ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net or Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the file Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the source package .
to compile and install on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; use the following command in the base folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ dir returns the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , you will find more details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file .
da &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should not have problems when comp@@ iling . however , if difficulties occur , please report to the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mail@@ ing@@ lists of it .
cut ( C@@ trl @-@ X or Shift ) copies to the clip@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( C@@ trl @-@ V or Shift @-@ In@@ sert ) paste the text from the clip@@ board at the current cursor position respectively replaces the current selection .
show only differences : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the destination folder .
( in the current program version , you need to re @-@ read the folder with the refresh function after changes to these options . )
there are only entries showing differences . this also causes identical files to be copied to the destination folder when mer@@ ging . if the destination folder does not already contain these files , they will be missing after mer@@ ging . ( the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version . ) This option is disabled in default .
note the buttons to select the source using the A , B and C label below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the rows from the corresponding window will be app@@ ended to the end of the selected group in the results window ( if they are not already present ) . if the rows are already present , they will be removed by clicking on the button .
in default , this option is disabled . differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white characters .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini preview of all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . it is quite practical to see the running programs on the work surfaces , change their size , finish them or shift them . this works both within a desktop and several .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; it can display all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others .
with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved inside &amp; p@@ ager ; moving is possible both within a desktop and on other work surfaces .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : if on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; when cli@@ cked , the context menu has only the two entries P@@ ager to set up ... and exit . if , however , click on an application within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; clicking on an application within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; if however , click on an application within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; additionally , the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries Minim@@ ize , Maxim@@ ize , On Desktop and Finish .
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
if this check box is selected , windows can be moved within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other areas of work .
when this field is selected , the names of the virtual des@@ kt@@ ops will be displayed in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager .
tick this field lets the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; display the numbers of the virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . if it is checked together with the name , the names are provided with folder numbers , &amp; eg ; 1 . desktop .
if this field is selected , the background of each desktop will also be displayed as background in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager .
when this field is selected , the running programs are displayed as small windows in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise , only empty spaces are displayed to enable their selection .
here the view of the program window is selected . the window with its default symbol and pixel map shows a small view of the actual program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; main window can be determined : classi@@ cally lets &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ N Grid appear , as is known from P@@ ager applications in some other Windows managers ; horizontal indicates all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops in a horizontal and vertical row , which is very good for viewing at the side on the desktop .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , displaying and moving the windows as symbols or with their contents . furthermore , it runs outside the control bar .
right @-@ click within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and then set up sel@@ ector switch ... allows the dialog to appear .
at the moment , this cannot be changed in the Settings dialog . but you can do this manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ .@@ If you do not have a write permission for the file , you must log in as user root or contact your system administrator . in this file you have to enter the key win@@ dow@@ Transpar@@ ent@@ Mode and assign a value to it . possible values are :
as &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; part of the package k@@ de@@ base , you need a working installation of the K@@ DE basic packages .

&amp; k@@ not ; is a screen lou@@ pe . you can use &amp; k@@ not ; enlarge a part of the screen , as if you read a magni@@ fying glass for the print or the exact viewing of a photo . this application is interesting for different users : these include artists , web designers and people with visual impairment . this documentation should be a complete manual for the use of &amp; k@@ .a
&amp; k@@ not ; is a very powerful application that is constantly expanded with new functions . it is optimized for use on low @-@ performance computers .
if you like &amp; k@@ not ; start , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; k@@ not ; shows the enlarged area of the screen . in the following , this window is called magni@@ fying window . the image that is displayed in the magni@@ fying window is an enlarged area of the screen and is listed below as a selection window .
in the default setting , &amp; k@@ not ; the range around the mouse poin@@ ter is like a moving magni@@ fying glass . alternatively you can drag &amp; k@@ not ; this causes a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( selection window mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse poin@@ ter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; on the left side of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid that the mouse poin@@ ter is displayed in the enlarged window , select the setting of the mouse cursor . please note that &amp; k@@ not ; currently not able to recognize the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the default k@@ de ; / Q@@ t ; mouse poin@@ ter .
in the drop @-@ down mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow keys and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse cursor in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button down so you can capture and move the content of the magni@@ fier window . this also works with the arrow keys .
if you additionally press the &amp; Shift key , or use the &amp; M@@ MB ; you can move the selection window .
this combination allows you to change the size of the selection window . note that the top left corner of the selection window remains fixed and only the lower right corner is to be moved .
&amp; k@@ not ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer , save it into a file , copy it to the clip@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , rotate the image and much more .
stopping or stopping the ad update . stopping the update will cause the needed CPU time to go against 0 .
select the refresh rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , High , Very high ) . the higher the refresh rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode , a selection box is displayed . the selected area is displayed in a window .
&amp; k@@ not ; automatically uses your set short@@ cuts to save files , open a new window , print , rel@@ o@@ ads ( re@@ charge the document in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , zoom in and down , etc ; .
may also be known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; is a screen lou@@ pe . you can magni@@ fy &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; use a magni@@ fier to view the small print in a newspaper or photo . this application is useful for different people : from research or artist to web designer or visually impaired .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter res@@ ides for a while in the same place . it is intended to help people suffering from R@@ SI &apos;s syndrome ( Rep@@ eti@@ tive @-@ Stra@@ in @-@ In@@ jury Syndrome ) and which every mouse click causes pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter res@@ ides in the same place . it is intended to help people who suffer from the Rep@@ eti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and which every mouse click causes pain . besides , it can em@@ ulate the pulling with the mouse . this requires a little practice though .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can circum@@ vent the pain created when you click the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without any pain . unfortunately , you may experience pain caused by using your computer , you should consult a doctor if this is not yet done .
to make it clear even once : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; avoid pain caused by mouse clicks , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic aids , the result can be different for everyone .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movement and performs a mouse click as soon as you pause the movement briefly .
is the intelligent shift enabled , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a pause after pressing the mouse button . move the mouse , wait until the end of the movement until releasing the mouse button . in this way , you can perform a little exercise , but you get used to it quickly .
this residence time must be c@@ ached after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a click of the mouse .
if Intelli@@ gent@@ es Move enabled , the shooting time is activated ( 1 / 10 s ) . here the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after pressing down the mouse button wa@@ its before releasing the mouse button again if no moving of the mouse takes place .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports clicking through mouse shift . if this function is enabled , a slow moving to the left and back leads to a double click . these movements are stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ txt , when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the first time is started , but they can be changed later .
if the sound is delayed , you can drag &amp; k@@ de to shor@@ ten the response time . go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select Sound System and here the General tab . there &apos;s a sli@@ der sound buffer that lets you adjust to a lower value to shor@@ ten response times .
if this setting is checked , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool will be launched at every start . this function is currently only available under &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only available under &amp; k@@ de ; at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically .
reset all settings to the values set when the dialog opens . if you have already pressed the Apply button , the settings are reset to the stand after the last pressing of the user .
the best use is &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first of all , with the default settings . in particular , the intelligent shifting should be switched off initially . if you then get used to the automatic mouse click , you can later accept the intelligent moving .
if you use the audi@@ ble click it may be necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; for sounds .
first , you should be aware of what places a mouse click without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or places in the browser window that does not represent a link does not lead to unwanted reactions . you can therefore park your mouse in such places until you want to use it again .
when your mouse bu@@ cks , you should clean your mouse . this is usually quite simple . the trick is that you do not only clean the mouse ball , but also the rollers that come into contact with the mouse ball .
first you need to take out the mouse ball . how this happens is different from mouse to mouse . however , it should be clear when you look at the bottom of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the hole into which the ball was inserted . the dirt and the dirt can easily scra@@ pe with a flat blade or the f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail .
in very rare situations the operating system interrup@@ ts the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you are using the intelligent moving , this means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation is no longer able to stop the operation by releasing the mouse button .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; using another window manager and moving a window .
the solution to this problem is that you make a click of the mouse . this will reset the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , and you can continue working as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and put the cursor to another place .
solution : use the mouse to place the cursor to where you want it . but use the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop when you want to have a keyboard input . secure zones for the mouse poin@@ ter are &amp; eg ; the gray surfaces around the toolbar and menus and the front rows of windows .
I try to work with the intelligent moving , but I don &apos;t manage to edit lyrics .
the intelligent moving is an advanced feature of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very well possible to select text to copy it into the clip@@ board and insert it again or execute any other action where you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button .
do not use the smart move if you just start using &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; instead , press a mouse click at the end of the text area and hold the Shift key while moving the mouse cursor to the other end of the text and click the mouse button again .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this always plays when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button plays a sound like a mouse click . so you know exactly when the move time begins with the intelligent moving . later you can use the intelligent moving without the mouse click .
to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; be able to use the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X Window ; this should be the case on most system .
the functionality of the mouse click is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers and these are correctly set up .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; press the mouse button as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter res@@ ides briefly . this program has been developed for people who suffer from R@@ SI syndrome and those affected by the cra@@ cking of the mouse buttons .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured to start a drawing process before releasing the mouse button . in this way , drag and drop can be done with the mouse .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program with which silent users can let their computers speak for themselves .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth , silent users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can select phrases that are to be spoken again from a list with the conversation history .
on the first page of the wizard ( left screen shot ) enter the command that will be used later for the speech output of text . for more details , see the description of the setup dialog .
on the second page you can choose the standard text entry book . from the text passages you can often choose text passages without having to type them . the text passages can of course be edited .
on the third page ( right screen shot ) you determine the dictionary for the word completion . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the selected language to determine the frequency of individual words . in addition , you can synchron@@ ize the word lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , so that only correctly sp@@ elled words can be added to the word extension .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and contains essentially an input field for the keyboard input of your pro@@ positions ( the lower white field in the screen@@ shot ) and a delay memory of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in the screen@@ shot ) .
if you have set correctly , you can enter the phrases you want to hear in the input field . each spoken proposition is attached to the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory . you can select sets which are to be spoken again .
with the menu entry Settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the Settings dialog from &amp; k@@ mouth ; . this dialog contains two flash@@ cards , voice output and settings , page wor@@ ter@@ current as well as the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page .
in the input field of the box speech output you enter the command to call the voice generator . in the box under the input field , specify the character encoding that will be passed on to the voice generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box if the text should be passed on as standard input to the voice generator .
if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed as a parameter . you can use the following wild@@ cards :
of course , the command to voice output depends on your language generator . you will find this command in the documentation for your language generator . examples for this are found in the app@@ endi@@ x .
with Pos@@ sible kt@@ ts@@ d as a language service is used &amp; k@@ mouth ; first try to pass the text to K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if this is successful , the other settings on this page are ignored . kt@@ ts@@ d language service is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ da@@ emon , the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications a standardized interface for voice output is available and which is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . the choice of this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
the first selection field action after selecting a text passage tells you which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by choosing a text passage in the Text passage book or in the bar for text passages .
with the selection of So@@ fort he will speak the selected passage directly and additionally inserted into the exp@@ iry date . with the selection of Add to the input field , the selected passage is entered only in the input field .
with the second sel@@ ector closing of the editing window for text entry book , you can specify whether the text entry book should be saved automatically when the editing window is closed .
when you choose to make changes , the text@@ book book will not be saved . if you select to make changes , then the text entry book will not be saved . if you ask before saving , you will ask &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text entry script is to be saved .
the Wor@@ ter@@ current page contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for word completion . in the main window next to the input field , &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection field , if this list contains more than one dictionary . with this selection box , you can select the currently used dictionary for word completion .
with buttons on the right of the page you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books , or export them to a file . below the list , you can specify the name and the language for the dictionary in the input field .
select the desired language for this source ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then reads &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the frequency of each word is simply by counting the occurrence . in addition , you can compare the wor@@ d@@ list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org Dictionary to insert only properly written words into the new dictionary .
with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then asks which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how these dic@@ tion@@ aries are to be weigh@@ ted .
with this option , you create a new , empty dictionary with no entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; automatically insert words entered into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary in the course of time .
the main area of the window for editing text passages is divided in two . in the upper part the text passages are displayed as tree structure .
in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the corresponding keyboard short@@ cut . if you have selected a text passage book , you can only change its name .
you can add actions such as new text passages or books or delete selected text passages and books either by selecting the menu bar , toolbar or drop @-@ down menu .
the order of text passages or text passages can be changed by drag@@ ging with the mouse to the new location or using the arrow keys and the &amp; alt key .
the selected text is cut out and copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected portions of the disk memory .
the selected text is copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected portions of the disk memory .
the currently active proposition is spoken . if there is text in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected phrases of the flow memory .
if this menu entry is checked , a sliding toolbar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed . by default , the toolbar can be moved directly under the menu bar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and drag@@ ging , the toolbar can be moved to another location .
if this menu entry is checked , a narrow bar is displayed in the lower part of the main window with notes about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; if not checked , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu entry is checked , a sliding bar is displayed for text passages with entries . by default , the bar is located above the editing pane directly below the toolbar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and drag@@ ging the toolbar can be moved to another location .
probably you have not entered the command for voice output properly or not completely . open Settings k@@ mouth ; set up the General Settings page and enter the command for voice output on the map voice output . ( see Settings dialog for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers for further details . )
Festival is a language edition system at the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported .
to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival folder .
Free@@ T@@ TS is a written language generator written in &amp; Java . currently , it only supports the English pron@@ unciation . the license allows you to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and without further restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in / usr / local / fre@@ etts . the voice output is then possible with one of the following command examples :
for the third example , the option must be turned on as default input . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a wa@@ v@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to dis@@ assemble the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text into phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / ha@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA .
unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax is happy to swal@@ low up the last character of the text so that an additional character must be added . the complete command is therefore more complex than in the other examples :
( CAT - ; echo quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / jihadi@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; art@@ sp@@ lay / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option to send data as default input must be turned on .
the voice output da@@ emon from &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ further language service that provides all &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various voice output systems .
since the setting of the voice generator is only done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use it as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth .
to setup , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page , which appears in the Settings dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use it successfully , you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB of memory ( and additionally memory for the voice generator ) , but this depends on your computer and its configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application that allows people who can &apos;t talk to print text through the computer . a list of already spoken sentences is stored , which can be om@@ itted by the user again and again .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; not a voice syn@@ thesizer . a voice syn@@ thesizer needs to be installed on your computer .

before you can use it , you need to install and set program speech @-@ disp@@ en@@ sers .
on the first launch of a t@@ m@@ gr or as long as no speaker is set up , the card holder is displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker set up , the card card is displayed in general .
most T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , as well as different male or female , or those that differ in volume or speed . you can also set up several variants for a syn@@ thesizer . you should at least set up a speaker before you use &amp; kt@@ ts ; otherwise the program speed dis@@ cards otherwise use the standard speaker .
various speakers for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable to several printer queu@@ es for the same printer .
if you click on the card tra@@ cker in kt@@ m@@ m@@ gr , the tab card will be displayed . this will also appear automatically when you start kt@@ ap@@ m@@ gr and no speaker is set up yet .
all speakers already equipped appear in this list . the preferred speakers will appear on the top of the list . the top speaker is used for voice output if an application does not present a speaker .
select a speaker from the list with a mouse click and click this button to remove the speaker from the list .
select a speaker from the list with a mouse click and click this button to change the settings . see below .
with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click this button to push the speaker in the list one line further down . the order of the speakers in the list also determines their priority .
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the running &amp; desktop ; system .
choose one type of voice , three male and three female voices as well as a boys and girls voice are available .
when you click here , the new speaker appears on the tab card speaker . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit .
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; almost use it . go back to the tab card General and check if voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) to enable the T@@ TS service from &amp; k@@ de . see . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; see . now , you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; click on the tab orders to create and manage text orders .
if you have at least one speaker , you can start the language distribution system of &amp; k@@ de ; click on the General tab for opening this card . here you can set some general options .
select this check box to activate the &amp; kt@@ ts ; this starts the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . this starts the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start is successful , the card card orders will be displayed and you can create and read text orders . see . remove the mark , K@@ TT@@ LED will stop and the T@@ TS system from &amp; k@@ de ; disabled .
if kt@@ m@@ m@@ gr is finished , runs &amp; kt@@ ts ; continue , provided the box is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
if this check box is selected and kt@@ m@@ m@@ gr appears automatically in the system area of the control bar when reading , it disappears again as soon as the preview is finished .
with buttons in this row , you can start , stop , pause and resume text orders .
with buttons in this row you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; clip@@ board or open a text file for reading . you can also switch the speaker for a job .
click Apply or OK , then all changed settings will be applied to all pages .
the card card orders are displayed only when K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to launch K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the General tab and tick the box on the box ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser from &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed web page . check the text that is to be read before and select Tools Text in the main menu . after a short time , the voice output should start .
it is almost always sensible to mark the desired text of a web page . you can also skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; pre@@ tension@@ ers and other invisible marks are also read .
in &amp; k@@ ate ; the advanced text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the displayed text . first check if &amp; kt@@ ts ; then check the text that is to be read and select Tools Text in the main menu . then the voice output should start .
this also works when &amp; k@@ ate ; embedded in other applications as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; .
K@@ Noti@@ fy is the &amp; k@@ de news system that noti@@ fies you of events you have set . you can read the text of this news from &amp; kt@@ ts ; read it .
in &amp; conversation ; , the &amp; k@@ de I@@ RC program , you can set up different types of messages ; for example , you can set up &amp; conversation ; for example , set up a message where your nick@@ name is found in which your nick@@ name is found . with &amp; kt@@ ts , you can then read the I@@ RC message text .

filters for string replacement provide a good way in &amp; kt@@ ts ; incorrect st@@ ressing or er@@ ron@@ eous messages to correct . it removes the tags b@@ r and b from the messages sent by K@@ Mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , since it can be assumed in most cases as pres@@ upp@@ os@@ ed . read also .
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
in filters text is processed before it is sent to speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ chers . they are useful for improving pron@@ unciation , to replace mis@@ spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , select a suitable language and speaker or to avoid certain defici@@ encies of speech syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
to understand the working method of filters , it is important to know how the &apos; speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher &apos; program works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; distinguishes four types of texts .
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and stops these jobs . if the output of the screen reader is read , the continued orders are resum@@ ed .
warning has the next priority . this level is important news as eg ; processor is reserved to hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after issuing the warning .
News have the next highest priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you can read a long text on a website , you can start with &amp; k@@ mouth ; anyone who just enters the room . &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ al@@ erts are also news .
the rest are simple text orders . each order you receive from the card card orders is a text order . K@@ S@@ ay@@ it is an example of an application that uses text orders . text orders are intended for the output of longer texts , which do not have any special ur@@ gency .
all four order cards are processed in queu@@ es , except for the output of screen readers . when an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one of them reads , this output is hal@@ ted and ended .
first you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen readers . they are applied to normal warnings , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ messages .
filter the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future there may be further types of filters .
strings replacing parts of a text by other text . you can specify the parts to be replaced either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is delivered with predefined string sets which allow the creation of chat @-@ emo@@ ti@@ cons such as : - ) by text or for reform@@ at@@ ting messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better intelli@@ gible form .
&amp; XML ; conver@@ ters use an X@@ S@@ LT file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert from one format to another format . included in &amp; kt@@ ts ; are some X@@ S@@ LT files to translate &amp; X@@ HTML ; contained in SS@@ ML .
with subscri@@ ber selection filters you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent to a speaker . for example , if you have set a female voice on the card board speaker , you can read the text from K@@ DE messages about it .
each of these filters has adjustable rules , after which it is applied to a speech output . if the filter determines that its rules do not apply , the text will remain unchanged to the next filter .
when a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; notification to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent , it is processed by all activated filters that have been set up on the bottom . the processing by the filters is done in the order in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of normal filters . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed from the top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter and the following guidelines will be displayed below .
for setting string offset filters you have to enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparison patterns . if these patterns are found in the text , then the text is exchanged for the corresponding replacement text .
enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name arbitr@@ arily , it only needs to be distinguished from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column ann@@ ot@@ ation . the list is executed in the order from top to bottom .
click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list .
with these buttons you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . load a list from a file , the entries from the file are app@@ ended to the existing list .
if a language is entered here , the filter will only be applied if the spokesperson for the text order speaks one of the languages mentioned here . click the button to view a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you press the &amp; C@@ trl + key at the click of the mouse .
if a value is entered here , the filter will only be applied if the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separated by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application ID of running programs is available with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; d@@ bus ; numbers must be om@@ itted . if , for example , &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID copy @-@ 34@@ 32 indicates , you may only enter copies .
the string replacement filter is only applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter if all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts .
when comparing words , the string replacement filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ . so words must be limited on both sides by separ@@ ators ( spaces ) .
in this manual you will find no instructions for writing regular expressions . if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions you can find in the package ambig@@ u@@ ity .
XML ; transform@@ ers translate &amp; XML ; using X@@ S@@ LT files from one format to another format . X@@ S@@ LT ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W3@@ C standard for such transform@@ ations . it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility program must be installed on your system .
enter the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c can be reached via the PAT@@ H environment variable , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c suff@@ ices .
with the spokes@@ man selection filter , you can send texts to a particular speaker , which is set on the card box speaker , or to a speaker with specific features . you can , for example , specify that texts should be read by k@@ mail from a female voice . see .
before &amp; t@@ ts ; a text is passed to the filter , it looks for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected based on the speaker properties that specify the program that sends the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sends , and the properties of the speakers equipped on the card card speaker . with the speaker selection filter , you can over@@ ride the selected speaker .
if a value is entered here , the filter is applied if the text contains the entered regular expression . is installed on your system of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ents installed , you can call it by clicking on the button to get help when entering .
in order to achieve faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
specify the characteristics of the speaker you want . if the text meets the filter conditions shown above , the speaker is selected to match the desired requirements . click on the button on the right to display the dialog box selection dialog .
use these buttons to save or load your microphone settings or delete all settings .
the speaker output filter is only applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter if applicable . you must enter at least one condition .
the voice output API , by &amp; k@@ de ; , with which programmers can give their applications T@@ TS skills . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD about &amp; d@@ bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the voice syn@@ thesizer to be added to K@@ TT@@ LED , so &amp; kt@@ ts ; this syn@@ thesizer can use .
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; interface of the language output API from &amp; k@@ de ; see the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications request voice output list using the &amp; d@@ bus ; -@@ Interface from &amp; k@@ de ; from the program kt@@ m@@ d to the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
text of the text for reading and option is a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are even more commands that you can use . for a list of all commands , enter
open two &amp; Con@@ sole ; -@@ windows . first run kt@@ m@@ d in a window , then kt@@ m@@ m@@ gr in the other .
none of the above speech syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers support my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ Form@@ ing filter , but with the use of the module for festival websites are not read .
due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta you need to install the ( male UK ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone so that S@@ able does not work at all . you &apos;ll have to do it yourself if you do not use this voice for reading from web pages . also make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found via the PAT@@ H environment variable .
certain characters or punc@@ tu@@ ation notes seem to cause errors in the syn@@ thesizer , so that whole sets are ski@@ pped or only ch@@ ewing g@@ ossi@@ p is spent . what can I do about it ?
first make sure the character encoding option is set to the correct value for the corresponding language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , these may possibly be remedi@@ ed by a string replacement filter . see .

speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher &apos;s program uses an adap@@ table module architecture for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to expand &amp; t@@ t for using a different syn@@ thesizer , contact the developer team .
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter , but is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c command .
to compile and run , you need a current K@@ DE development environment ( version 3.4 or later ) including the k@@ deli@@ bs package and the developer files for the &apos; speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher &apos; program .
if you have the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source code archive for c@@ aching , or have downloaded the tar@@ ball that you created all night , compile and install the program using the following commands :
before you use &amp; kt@@ ts ; check first whether speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher works correctly with your voice syn@@ thesizer . you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf to do so .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr should be developed in such a way that the setup of speech dis@@ cards is possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer needed .
a long text is broken down into individual sentences . the user can go back , repeat , stop or cancel instructions or paragraph style .
if an application provides text to &amp; kt@@ ts , it can specify the properties of the preferred speaker for the output . if you have set up a speaker whose language English and its gender is female , this will be used , otherwise the best suitable speaker is chosen . if you want to know more about how &amp; t@@ ts ; select a speaker , you will see in .
if you click on Add button on the tab card and in order to add a speaker to the list or click Edit , the box for speaker placement will be displayed . for example , the module for Festival Interactive is shown below .
enter the path to the festival program exec@@ utable . if the path to Festival is included in PAT@@ H , you only need to enter the festival .
select the character encoding for text submitted to the festival . in the case of voices , the &amp; kt@@ ts ; this setting is done automatically . in general , Western languages use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
these sli@@ ders allow you to adjust volume , speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select some control and display this grey , the voice you choose doesn &apos;t allow these settings to be displayed .
several voices like multi @-@ sy@@ n voices require several seconds to be loaded because of their size . when you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ LED , so that ( with bigger memory consumption ) the first set is syn@@ thes@@ ized faster .
if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet set up a speaker ( or click on user to click ) .
if this check box is selected , the program window is displayed at the start of a t@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , after the start , only the symbol t@@ m@@ gr in the system section is visible , but not the program window . click the icon in the system section to display the program window .
if this check box is marked and t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr doesn &apos;t run yet , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . this allows you to stop or otherwise control the reading .
here are all orders listed in the queue , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sets and the currently processed set . the speaker ID corresponds to the column ID on the card box speaker .
with the buttons in this series , you can move forward or backward in the order selected in the list below . ( but not every job consists of several sets ) .
by clicking on OK , all changes in the settings ( also on the other card cards ) are taken over and t@@ t@@ m@@ gr will be reduced to the icon in the system section . then click on this icon to view the program window again .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ en , click the audio card audio . see also .
here only text orders are listed and managed . screen readers , warnings and messages will not be displayed . for more information on the message types of &amp; kt@@ ts , see .
select here the type of audio output . if a component cannot be selected , &amp; kt@@ ts ; either compiled without support for the appropriate audio module or &amp; kt@@ ts ; cannot load the necessary libraries .
if you want to use G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de for the audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are shown in the list , you must install at least one module . if you have selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here .
set the Spe@@ ech Speed here . 50@@ 1 ; % matches about half and 200@@ 1- % about the double normal speaking speed . so that these settings can be implemented , the program needs to be so@@ x installed .
click Apply to take over the new settings for the running &amp; desktop ; system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you &apos;ll need to figure out what device works with you . in case of doubt , choose Standard .
on this tab card you can set up special actions , which are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of speech messages :
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and stops these jobs . after the release of the screen reader is read , the retained orders are resum@@ ed .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important messages like &amp; eg ; processor is reserved to hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after reading the warning .
News has the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that messages messages . if you have just read a long text on a website , you can talk to &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone who just enters the room .
sends a text order interrupted by a message , warning or output of a screen reader , inserts &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output into the queue .
this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both introduc@@ tory sound and the introduc@@ tory message are active , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the incoming message .
the settings on this card are only valid for normal text orders . there are no special actions for messages , warnings or screen re@@ a@@ vers if they are interrupted by a higher priority message .
to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; K@@ noti@@ fy messages , run kt@@ ap@@ m@@ gr and click noti@@ fications . the tab card noti@@ fications will appear .
select this check box to disable the reading of &amp; k@@ de ; if this setting is not checked , the other settings are disabled and &amp; kt@@ ts ; do not read al@@ erts .
if this setting is selected , noti@@ fications on which sound is played are triggered by &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read .
use these buttons to add or delete events to the list . if you click the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message before , the &amp; conversation ; sends if someone in an I@@ RC message men@@ tions your nick@@ name .
all events for which nothing else is specified in the list are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts ; ignored .
use this selection field to specify what &amp; kt@@ ts ; to do when an event occurs . you have the following choices :
if you have selected predefined text , enter the desired text . you can use the following wild@@ cards :
you can enter the properties of the desired speaker here . the standard sel@@ ects the speaker , which is displayed as the top entry in the list on the card card speaker . see also .
note that there are three levels for events . if an action is specified for a specific event of a particular application , it is executed . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application . as the last option , the action comes to carry , which has been specified under standard ( all other events ) .
the event All noti@@ fications for the application Standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this purpose , you can specify the noti@@ fications to be sent as follows :
use the Save button to save the settings for the noti@@ fications in a file . use the Load button to load stored settings from a file . the loaded events will be merged with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except All noti@@ fications are deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W3@@ C standard to mark text for voice output . this standard contains marks for controlling voice , speech velocity , volume , gender of voice and pitch . also marks for controlling the pron@@ unciation of such as abbrevi@@ ations . SS@@ ML is part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W3@@ C standard .
currently supports &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you need to install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) since this is the standard voice that uses the festival in the edition of SS@@ ML .
if the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog is not set to 100@@ mm , SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ous .

there are two types of filters - normal filters and pro@@ posi@@ tional filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . thus , S@@ B@@ Ds can begin to divide words into individual sentences . this way , you can start or stop or pause and stop assignments on the card card , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer doesn &apos;t support this directly .
here you see the pro@@ posi@@ tional marker filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts , a set limit identi@@ fier is automatically set up . you can change its settings or add other pro@@ posi@@ tional filters , but beginners will not be dis@@ cour@@ aged .
the easiest way to learn how to set up the speaker selection by checking out . turn off the speaker selection and enter text to read . if you switch the speaker selection again , change some properties and check the selection of the speaker . of course , you need to have more than one speaker set up , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; then faster with pre @-@ reading , since only the first set needs to be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long ,
you can pause or cancel text orders on the card card even if the voice syn@@ thesizer doesn &apos;t support this function .
for these reasons , the normal pro@@ posi@@ tional code detection filter is automatically set up when you start t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it can not be switched off , only removed . do not change anything at this filter unless you know what you are doing .
pro@@ posi@@ tional code filters compare text with a regular expression for punc@@ tual ends and add a tab character ( decim@@ al code 8 ) to the set limits ( tabs are removed from the text in front of the filter ) . note that the default set constra@@ int detection filter maintains the punc@@ tu@@ ation .
S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ messages ( k@@ notify ) , warnings , messages or the output of screen readers .
if you have removed the normal pro@@ posi@@ tional code filter , you can insert it again by loading the file standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c included in &amp; t@@ ts .
on the tab card selection you can over@@ write the speech settings for the application .
use of the standard speaker ( the top one on the card card speaker ) . in other words : no speaker properties are specified .
use of the most appropriate speaker , which has all the characteristics of an equipped speaker . if you do not delete or edit the speaker &apos;s settings , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; this speaker . otherwise select &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker that best matches the originally set characteristics .
select the method to input the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
select the characteristics of the desired speaker . if this feature does not matter , enter nothing .
select this check box if the property is to take preced@@ ence over other properties . you can also set several markers here .
as the language is a critical factor when understanding the output , it is always treated as a primary feature . you will rarely use this feature . the only case you may want to specify the attribute language is when you know that a particular application text is sent in another language than the one in the working environment .
to delete all the features in the Spe@@ aker area , which is best suited to the following , click on the Standard Spe@@ aker button and then use a speaker that is most likely to follow the following .
in this case , 0 stands for the last text order in the queue . you can also specify an order number . ( without order number the input is 0 necessary ) .
kt@@ m@@ m@@ gr crashes immediately when it is started . I have compiled de@@ bug support , but I don &apos;t get trac@@ ing .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is crash and &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is finished . probably you have to register G@@ Stre@@ amer . with G@@ Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x , the command will be installed . if the problem is not resolved by this , a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed . you can try to update or uninstall any Stre@@ amer .
the audio output via AL@@ SA does not work if I play music at the same time with another application . when I stop a text order , freeze &amp; kt@@ ts ; a . on the &amp; console ; appears a message stating : Un@@ able to open PC@@ M .
on your system there is the problem that conflicts occur with AL@@ SA , which prevent simultaneous opening of several PC@@ M devices . for possible solutions , please visit the website of the AL@@ SA @-@ project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org .
I downloaded an additional voice for festival from the internet . I installed them and can use them in festival , but t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr doesn &apos;t show this voice .
add the new voice in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / fes@@ tival@@ int , vocals . as a guide , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; on which you have found the voice to the developers .
on the map audio card there is a setting speed . to make this work , the program needs to be installed so@@ x and can be discover@@ able via the PAT@@ H environment variable . some syn@@ thesizer modul@@ s such as Festival Interactive even offer a setting for speed on the card box for subscri@@ ber setup . depending on the selected voice , this is active or in@@ active .
the chat speed settings are ignored when &amp; t@@ ts ; &amp; HTML . ( this is because the HTML is converted into SS@@ ML . ) or , if you are quite brave , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ after @-@ SS@@ ML remo@@ del filter , and set up the speech speed .
I don &apos;t manage websites to be read with a female voice . I have set up a female festival speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the websites with a male voice .
at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta the Tag S@@ able GEN@@ DER doesn &apos;t seem to work . for the festival no errors are produced , the x@@ s@@ l file for converting from SS@@ ML to S@@ aber is the GEN@@ DER tag . the same also applies to the VO@@ ICE tags .
I added a separate label replacement filter and now I can go back and forth ; no longer set before or back . on the tab orders is displayed , the order only consists of one set . what am I doing wrong ?
you may not filter punc@@ tu@@ ation marks ( point , question marks , ex@@ clamation mark , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) . instead , use a filter for punc@@ tu@@ ation detection instead .

some users experience conflicts in the audio output associated with AL@@ SA . if your system also counts , you can &apos;t play music at the same time and read a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; also freeze when you stop a text order and then start another . you can find possible solutions for this problem on the AL@@ SA website ( d@@ mix ) website .
as of July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de does not support any real breaks . if you hold a text order in &amp; kt@@ ts , the current set will be read .

in &amp; k@@ de ; 4 is the module &amp; arts ; probably removed or at least only created on request .
the following modules for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers are created by default . some of them have a runtime dependen@@ cy of non @-@ free software . ( non @-@ free according to the Deb@@ ian Distribution guidelines ) , the configure parameter column shows the configure parameter which causes the passing of the creation .
default is &amp; kt@@ ts ; installed in / opt / k@@ de@@ 3 . if this folder is not listed in the environment variable $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS , you will need to specify the destination --@@ pre@@ fix = target . for example

before you use &amp; kt@@ ts ; check first whether your voice syn@@ thesizer is working properly . follow the instructions you received with the syn@@ thesizer .
Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers whose source code is open . the quality of the voices is generally good , and multiple voices and languages are supported .
you must install at least one language . you will find help in the instructions supplied with the festival . if you would like to read web pages , you must install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone .
for these voices you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . German voices are subject to restrictions on sharing .
this voice pres@@ upp@@ oses Festival 1.@@ 95 beta or later . the voice is still in an early stage of development . if you set up the Russian voices , you need to enter the voices MS@@ U _ ru _ NS@@ H _ di@@ phone . select a Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) encoding like ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . therefore , search the festival first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech language , the option must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the option must be set to an 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic such as ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival can be used together with the MB@@ RO@@ LA and Syn@@ thesizer . then Festival takes over the le@@ xi@@ cal analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; this creates the audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ program and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; not a full voice output system . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from di@@ phone files . you need additional software to create this di@@ phone . Festival generates this by &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; required di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also produce from German texts Di@@ phone . more information can be found here .
in this process , additional wra@@ pper code is added to the Festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices to voice synthesis . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voice files are not installed in &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; folders , but in the folder festival / li@@ b / .
I@@ MS German Festival is a modified version of Festival for German &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; Vo@@ ices . required is either Festival version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first install festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; then download MS German Festival from
instructions can be found in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file in the package you downloaded . ( for use with Festival 2.0 the playing of error corrections is not required , you just need to re @-@ translate the festival ) . then insert the following lines into the file festival / li@@ b / sit@@ ein@@ it@@ .@@ sc@@ m .

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; which allows the administration of network interfaces , routing and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a uniform , integrated interface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selecting K menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center .
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; -@@ package is designed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks :
after installation , a new module network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center will be displayed . the network settings module ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network network settings in &amp; K@@ Menu .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured to allow &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all displays and allows setting the network properties .
in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and installed when installing &amp; lin@@ ux . if network devices are added later , the drivers need to be loaded by adjusting the following files , according to the kernel version :
the network settings module is loaded when the network settings option is selected in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index . when starting the module network settings , this will automatically detect the used platform on the system .
if the platform cannot be recognized , the manual selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to choose which corresponds to the distribution and the release process . by marking the setting No @-@ again @-@ questions , the definition can be made permanently . when starting the network settings , this selection is automatically pre @-@ set .
changing the network settings is possible only in the system management mode . before , all options are shown in grey , which means , the settings can only be viewed , the change is not possible . in the system management mode , click the button system management mode at the right lower end of the module . it is necessary to enter the password .
the overall functionality of the module is available in the system management mode . this is divided into three tabs :
the network interfaces can be used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . the following tasks can be performed by the network interfaces :
the settings of displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button interface ... in the Settings dialog .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the Advanced Settings button displays the dialog with further options .
with the option Automati@@ cally , the TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched from a DH@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings for the system are carried out simultaneously with the start of the system services . DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information at each system start , so no further setting is required . in the selective list , either DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , according to the system , can be selected .
using Man@@ ually , the TCP / IP configuration can be configured without DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the input field IP address , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified .
if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface when bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is un@@ desirable , this option should not be enabled .
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address on the network is not already used . entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; Con@@ sole , you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in case of doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or switched off , depending on your needs . switching a switched network device is done by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ....
network devices can be activated or disabled according to your needs . dis@@ ab@@ ling an activated network device can be de@@ activated by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ....
specifies the IP address of the host in the local sub@@ net which communic@@ ates the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ nets .
if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is located .
a computer with DNS support replaces a full domain name by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the host ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS dis@@ solves this name into an IP address like 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the name resolution calcul@@ ator section of the Rei@@ der name resolution allows easy management of this list . entries can be added , removed , or changed . DNS records can be added by selecting an entry or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list with the buttons Hin@@ dered or Her@@ unter in priority .
by clicking the button Add ... from the group machine to name resolution a DNS server can be added . it will be displayed in the New Name Server dialog .
first you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry will then be inserted in the list .
from the group computer to name resolution select one entry and then click on the Edit button .... The Edit dialog will display .
the list of names , known by name , describes the host@@ name @-@ to @-@ IP address reference for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used when bo@@ oting when no DNS servers are available . in small , closed networks , it can replace DNS servers .
usually the list of names contains some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IPv@@ 6 addresses . this version of IP still being tested will replace version 4 in the future .
enter the IP address of the known computer and click Add ... Adding New Ali@@ as dialog will be shown .
enter the name of the known machine and click the Add button . if the well @-@ known machine has multiple alias names , press the Add button several times and enter the other alias names .
select an entry of a named host@@ name from the list and select Edit .... The dialog Modi@@ fied Calcul@@ ator will be displayed .
it can be done one of the following tasks , then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts .
the settings made in the module network settings are not immediately effective in the system . to enable the changes , the following command must be set in a &amp; Con@@ sole .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) it is enough if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
installation of the pre @-@ compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively , a graphical user interface can be used as a k@@ package or the installation tool of your distribution .
for this case the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is enough ; not , but additionally the development packages are needed with libraries and other things .
this is recommended only to experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf . the following commands should do this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology is given , in the second all of the configuration files are discussed in &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf .
this section cannot replace further knowledge about IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small ( home ) network is communicated .
there are currently IP networks operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IPv@@ 4 ) . IPv@@ 5 has never been widely distributed . IPv@@ 6 is expected to continue in the near future .
one of the most important information is knowing which IP address of a network interface is to be assigned . in external networks , at the &amp; eg ; workplace , the network administrator is the point of contact with a valid IP address or if available , DH@@ CP can be used . in any case , the IP address can not be chosen arbitr@@ arily !
when setting up an own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a particular area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet , therefore any use is possible .
of course , access to the Internet can be enabled for such machines by setting a gateway .
for smaller networks , usually addresses are used in the range from 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 . the area is big enough for networks up to 250 machines .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all hosts are nodes in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own calcul@@ ator ) . the default route is required for the IP forwarding .
the network address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to its own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which operates like a closed circle .
this section contains the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf , and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes dynamically changed in DSL connections , so it won &apos;t be surprised if there is a different content than specified in the case of active DSL connections .

&amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar . it offers the possibility to store several archives on a tape . the first was to create a surface for tar , which additionally offered the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for fast , selective un@@ packing . the second goal was to answer a question my wife asked : how much longer does it take when you secure ?
before a band can be used , it must be bound by &amp; dat ; this can happen in three ways :
&amp; k@@ dat ; R@@ ST the tape back and read the pre @-@ tension@@ ing information of the tape . recognize &amp; dat ; the pr@@ elo@@ ad on the tape is not , you will be asked if the tape is to be format@@ ted .
recognizes &amp; dat ; the pre @-@ tension@@ er , searches for the right index on your disk . if this cannot be found , you will be asked if the tape index is to be recre@@ ated .
when everything goes smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape has been integrated . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the contents of the tape can now be brow@@ sed by folding the entry for the tape .
before ej@@ ecting the tape , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this :
&amp; dat ; indicates by changing the symbol for the band that the integration for the band has been solved and shows in the status bar a corresponding message . the band can now be ej@@ ected without danger .
before a band of &amp; dat ; can be used , it must be format@@ ted by &amp; dat .
a band@@ age must be format@@ ted before you can use to store data . this process does not correspond to the format@@ ting in &amp; dat ; this process does not correspond to the format@@ ting in &amp; dat ; this process does not correspond to the format@@ ting in &amp; dat ; this process does not correspond to format@@ ting in &amp; dat ; if your tape drive requires format@@ ting before use , this must happen before you can be format@@ ted before using . floppy tape drives usually require a format@@ ting of the tape , but DA@@ T drives do not .
after entering the band name and the capacity , &amp; dat saves ; with the format@@ ting of the tape . all data on the tape is lost ! after completion of the format@@ ting process , the tape is automatically mounted and ready for use .
before you initiate the backup process , you need to select the files to be secured . this can happen in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder will be backed up .
select a backup job in the tree . only the files specified in the profile will be backed up .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be backed up .
right @-@ click on the local file tree and select in the Save menu ...
once the backup has been started , the dialog opens Settings for Backup . in this dialog you can check once again the selected files and change the settings for backup .
if you have confirmed the settings dialog box will appear . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the record for the drive . it will only check the selected file or folder .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
right @-@ click in one of the archives and select the menu item ...
once the test procedure has been started , the dialog box will appear for review . in this dialog you can review your selection and change the working folder for the review .
if you have confirmed the settings for the review , the dialog box will appear . this dialog shows the progress of the audit process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
before you can initiate the restore , the files that need to be restored must be selected . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives belonging to the record for the tape drive . it will only restore the selected file or sub@@ folder .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
right @-@ click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rest@@ ore ....
once the restore process has been started , the Settings dialog appears . in this dialog you can review your selection and change the working folder for recovery .
when you confirm the restore settings , the Rest@@ ore dialog appears . this dialog shows the progress of the restore process as well as the throughput and remaining time .
sometimes it is necessary to recre@@ ate the tape index file by means of the tape content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can create the index on two types of the volume :
this will create a security profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup job :
the current job folder where the backup should take place . the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the selected work@@ book .
for all folders that are listed under backup files , only the files located in the same file system are protected as the folder . folders that are on other fil@@ es@@ ystems can be entered separately under backup files . each entry is considered by tar independent of the others .
perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then are backed up .
the name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
delete the snapshot file before the tar call . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for next backup .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; files were not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
the settings can be set up from the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the complete path to the device file for the tape drive ( normally / dev / tape ) . this path must point to the non @-@ winding version of the tape .
this setting is active , conve@@ ys &amp; dat ; before the tape is mounted , the command mt load to the drive . in some drives this is necessary before reading or write operations can be performed .
if the option is switched on , try &amp; dat ; to lock the ej@@ ection during tape drive . possibly this setting does not work on all tape drives .
if the option is turned on , if you want to connect &amp; dat , the tape is automatically ej@@ ected . do not use this option with Flo@@ ppy Stre@@ am@@ ers .
if the option is turned on , try &amp; dat ; the hardware @-@ sided block size for the tape drive . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter if this setting is active or not , you must &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case , share the block size for your tape drive .
if &amp; dat ; a tape is format@@ ted , it writes a file at the beginning of the tape . this file should only cover a memory block on the tape . the content of the file is composed as follows :
( n byte ) The band ID . the format of this string is machine name : seconds , where host@@ name is the complete name of the system on which the tape was format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds passed since the period in which the tape was format@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the file $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat / .
the rest of the files on the tape are plain tar archives , which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as they are not incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the contents of a backup tape . this icon is only active when a band is involved .
&amp; k@@ system@@ lo@@ gue ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; viewer for system logs . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system provides the various protocol files . furthermore , &amp; k@@ system@@ lo@@ gue ; experienced users can quickly access , for example , information on problems that occur on their server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ lo@@ gue ; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ lo@@ gue ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system leaves the various protocol files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ lo@@ gue ; experienced users can quickly access , for example , information on problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ System@@ log ; therefore attempts to provide some advanced features that can be filtered and evaluated by the protocol files of certain programs .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; k@@ system@@ lo@@ gue ; a number of useful functions . this includes :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included and are explained in the other chapters of this manual .
as you see in the following screen@@ shot , &amp; k@@ system@@ lo@@ gue provides functions that can easily filter and sort the single protocol lines of a log file . the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after the startup tries &amp; k@@ system@@ lo@@ gue ; first the most important log file of the system - the system protocol - to open . if you do not see it , and it opens up instead of it a small message window , you have usually not started with system administrator rights . the protocol files are usually found under Linux in the / var / log folder , for which normal users usually do not have permission to read .
you can also use the filter strip to filter by a selected criterion or by setting the string . in the default setting , the selection box next to the filter will display the entry All . in the default setting , the selection box next to the filter will show the entry All . then a protocol line will only be displayed if the string of the filter search term is contained in one of the columns .
you can also select another entry at this point . the string of the filter search term will then only be compared to the entries in the selected column . for example , in the protocol file system log , select the process column process , and in addition , select the name of a process in the protocol file system log ; all protocol lines indicate which were sent or created by this process .
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . protocol lines of level errors are displayed with a more con@@ spic@@ uous color as a level critic . the color display of protocol lines can be switched off setup dialog .
if you only want to display a specific process ( for example , in the system protocol or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can show the process identification ( PID ) in the process column . this can be useful , for example , if you want to examine the output of a certain command such as the Sam@@ ba server start . in this case , you can use filter bar .
in addition , you can activate the option to new lines in the main window context menu to display all the new protocol lines that are added .
&amp; k@@ system@@ lo@@ gue ; allows you to display multiple log files in separate sub@@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a log in the menu .
&amp; k@@ system@@ loader ; has its own website at ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ org D@@ ort you will find more current information about the sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ lo@@ gue .
&amp; k@@ system@@ lo@@ gue ; also find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archive : k@@ system@@ log ; im &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ archive
welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; This section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
the system V In@@ it is quickly becoming the standard for controlling the program starts when the system starts up in the &amp; Linux world . it is because it is easier to use , more powerful , and more flexible than the traditional BSD @-@ In@@ it .
I will not go into historical aspects here ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
the in@@ it binary file is under / bin and not under / etc . this is important because maybe someone might try to switch a machine to System V In@@ it without ne@@ eding to re@@ install and re@@ format . therefore , you need to make sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there if there was one .
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it also differs from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a lot of scripts . basically you need a script for each system service you want to run when you start the system or when you switch to another run level . system services do not contain such things as Network , NFS , &amp; Send@@ mail ; or ht@@ tp@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not contain such things as set@@ serial , which is only started once . such calls are according r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should be under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if there is not much use for it . you can also create a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run a serial port on the serial port .
the kernel scans in different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first one it finds .
the default Run@@ level is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see a line in the initial range as the following :
at this point , you can take a look into the second column and probably notice that the default Run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change this , you can edit / etc / in@@ it@@ tab by hand and change the 3 . if you have mess@@ ed up something , then you can repair it by rest@@ art@@ ing the system and running the following :
but how does it start all the correct scripts ? if you enter ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d then you probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no real files in this folder . instead , each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory .
how does and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument such as start and stop . you can actually start these scripts by hand on the command line as follows :
this would stop the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if it contains a K , the script will be inv@@ oked with the argument stop . if it contains an S , the script will be called with the argument start .
some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could &amp; eg ; have a server running level that only runs ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , Network &amp; etc . in addition , I could also have a user runtime , that &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc ; starts .
here you will learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
using &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another pointing device is simple to not say tri@@ vial : just drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six Run@@ level to start it at this level ( or stop ) .
you can also move scripts between run@@ level@@ n or change the position within a level by drag@@ ging it somewhere else . this happens only if they pull out an entry from the range of available system services .
note : entries are moved if you drag them into a new section . to copy them only to a new Run@@ level , you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert it into the target area -- even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the action .
the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before attempting to insert the system service again .
note : currently there is no way to restore items thrown in the recy@@ cle bin . so be careful .
you can use the Tab key to activate the different working ranges ( Verfüg@@ bare System@@ dienste , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection top or below the previous one .
to move an entry to another run@@ level , move it with cut into the clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ trl ; X ) and insert it into the desired Run@@ level with insert ( with C@@ trl ; V ) .
to change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually , press the Enter key to switch the Properties dialog . use the Tab key to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the Enter key to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu require a confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . pres@@ ets are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise , they are restored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes to the default settings are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I have experim@@ ented with the standard run@@ level@@ n , and now the machine is constantly re@@ starting . what can I do ?
enter the LI@@ LO prompt lin@@ ux single and press the Enter key to start in single @-@ use mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the default runtime level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; provided under Run@@ level X but they are not executed .
if you are using &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Deli@@ x ( DL@@ D ) then you need to edit additional files in / etc that exist only in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution .
the way system services are started in these distri@@ butions simplifies configuration for the proprietary alignment programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately does not conform to any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v are planning an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using a different distribution : please check if all configuration files are available that are required by the respective system service ( and whether they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as eg ; Apache or ht@@ tp@@ d ) simply termin@@ ate without notice if their configuration files are not present or wrong@@ ly set up .
the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; runtime varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you are using a different distribution please send me information about the runtime to be added to this manual .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to begin with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; to read .
after you have made changes , you need to save it . either you use the appropriate icon of the toolbar or the Save in the File menu .
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two cards , the user and the user group list . to edit , select the desired user or the desired group with a double click on the entry .
some cards are displayed only if you have advanced system settings . only if you have limited space restrictions ( quot@@ a ) for users , a card card is created on which you can make individual settings . other cards appear , if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD uni@@ xes .
the card password management appears , if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD uni@@ xes .
this card only appears if space restriction ( quot@@ a ) is activated and initi@@ alized for at least one embedded file system ( quot@@ a user / quot@@ a group on the fil@@ esystem ) . here , parameters can be changed for each user , where the limited space limitations are in KB :
these parameters can be set individually for each fil@@ esystem . the current fil@@ esystem is selected using the field file system with restricted space limitation
the group of cards informs about the group affili@@ ations of the selected user . the standard group , to which the user belongs , can be found in the Pri@@ mary group . furthermore , the user can be a member of other groups by marking them in the large field .
the group dialog features a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or group , select Add from the Users or Group menu or click the appropriate Add button on the toolbar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user respectively the selected group works similarly .
with this module you can install the LI@@ LO System Manager , add , remove and change boot password , change time to boot of the default operating system , add the default operating system , remove , change operating systems , remove , change and more .
