<seg id="1">Translate the module website in the & konqueror; translate menu on Extras Website. select the source and target language of the translation from the drop-down list.</seg>
<seg id="2">If a part of the text is selected, only this portion of the whole & URL will be translated.</seg>
<seg id="3">Machine translation is only very rudimentary. babelfish produces in the best case a rough translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore, the translations should not make important decisions, without checking the translation beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only websites on the Internet can be translated. other texts should be translated by yourself on the Babelfish page, where you can directly insert texts to be translated.</seg>
<seg id="5">The package & package; contains several modules for & konqueror; despite its small size, they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some features of & konqueror; by making them more readily available.</seg>
<seg id="6">Further information about the use of & konqueror; and the built-in functions can be found in the user manual too & konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="7">To load these modules in & konqueror, select Setting Extensions.... Open the box maps tools and select the modules you want.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list of standard settings from the box kde; addons. please note that possibly more modules are on your system if you have additional software installed.</seg>
<seg id="9">You should install the kdebase package, the & konqueror; it contains before you compile this package.</seg>
<seg id="10">To use the crash module, click in & konqueror; on Tools crashes. then you can view the page, the & konqueror; crash, or delete the list of crashes, if present.</seg>
<seg id="11">The View Filter Module (also called folder filter) can be reached in the & konqueror; menu bar under Tools Inspector. with the module you can filter & konqueror; filter the current working directory in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="12">To use the DOM tree view in & konqueror, select Extras DOM Tree... and open a new window with the DOM of the currently displayed web page. as default, the display begins with the root node of the document, for example: documentElement, all other nodes are sub-elements of this root node.</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & konqueror; provides another view for objects with the MIME-Type inode / directory on local files. it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol and text views to view the contents of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">The peculiarity of & FSView; consists in representing nested folder hierarchies using a so-called tree map. tree maps allow the representation of the size of objects in nested structures. each object is represented by a rectangle, whose area is proportionally to its size. this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the child objects is smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">At & FSView, the size is the size of a file or folder, where the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it. thus, large files can easily be detected even if they are far below in the folder hierarchy. therefore, & FSView can be seen as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX command.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView, an entry in the Treemap display is a rectangle representing a file or folder in your filesystem. for easier navigation, the rectangles have useful color and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle that is switched over View Colour Mode can either represent depth for easy recognition of the nesting depth or the picture of another file property such as name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder. for each property, you can specify whether it is displayed at all, only if there is enough space to display or whether the area of subordinate rectangles occur. furthermore, you can specify the relative position of the label in the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">For treemaps, the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry. at the Treemap in & FSView, this goal is not always met. frames are drawn to represent the nesting of entries, and this frame will need space, which is then lost to the subordinate entries. note that less space is lost for the frame when the rectangle is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">How splitting the area of an entry for the subordinate entries is left to the implementation. here it is always advantageous for caption and avoidance of space losses through frames in such a way that rectangles are created that are as square as possible. the best methods in this regard are rows, columns or recursive divisions.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can specify the minimum displayed area for an entry over the menu entry View Anhold on area. instead, a diamond pattern will be drawn into the area of the higher-level entry, to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a lower entry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally & FSView was designed as a small test application and introduction to the usage of the TreeMap widget developed for the application of KCachegrind.</seg>
<seg id="23">The View picture gallery can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Tools Picture Gallery... or using Ctrl; I.</seg>
<seg id="24">When you visit the Picture Gallery module, a dialog opens which allows you to specify the image of the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="25">The title of the page allows you to customize the title of the picture gallery page in a text entry field.</seg>
<seg id="26">The option images per line has a slider and a script to set the number of mini images of each row in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="27">The box to display the filename of the image indicate whether the file names are displayed in the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="28">Using the image box to display the file size of the image indicate whether the file size is displayed in the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="29">The image size check box indicates whether the size of the images is displayed in the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the Folder dialog, specify where the gallery will be saved and which subfolders will be included.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the File selection Save in HTML file, enter where the HTML page is to be saved.</seg>
<seg id="32">With the subfolder check box you can set with a slider or a rotation field, up to which level the subfolders are included.</seg>
<seg id="33">Use the check box to copy original pictures to see if the original pictures should be copied to the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="34">Using the comment file in the box, you can specify a comment file for the caption of the images in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="35">In the check box Own color depth, you can adjust a different color depth for the thumbnails than in the original pictures.</seg>
<seg id="36">The module & HTML; -Settings provides easy access to the general & HTML; -Settings for & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="37">The module & HTML; -Settings can be found in the & konqueror; -menu in Tools HTML settings. the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here:</seg>
<seg id="38">Media playback for the navigation pane can be found in the & konqueror; -menu under the navigation pane window or using the F9 keyboard shortcut.</seg>
<seg id="39">To play, click on the & konqueror navigation pane; and drag the music files you want to listen to in the media playback.</seg>
<seg id="40">Modify browser recognition add a menu entry in the & konqueror; add the browser and operating system identifier for individual domains. this is useful for websites that allow access only with certain browsers.</seg>
<seg id="41">The default browser recognition of the & konqueror; is Mozilla / 5.0 (compatible; Konqueror / 3.3; Linux) (KHTML, like Gecko). if you come to a website that refuses access with this browser, change the browser recognition in one of the following options.</seg>
<seg id="42">Changes the identifier in MSIE for sites that reject access with browsers on the basis of Mozilla. for example, you need the MSIE browser recognition to call with the & konqueror; Hotmail.</seg>
<seg id="43">Pages that do not correspond to the W3C standard or use your own & HTML; - elements and attributes are displayed correctly with the identifier of this outdated browser.</seg>
<seg id="44">This option will use the browser identifier for all pages of the site you are currently visiting.</seg>
<seg id="45">With the menu entry... you can set the amount of information about the browser used and the operating system in the individual.</seg>
<seg id="46">With this & konqueror; -module check your & CSS; -Style sheets and & HTML; -documents according to the recommendations of the W3C and other standards.</seg>
<seg id="47">Check the module website in the & konqueror; check the Tools menu on the Tools website. you can test the following tests:</seg>
<seg id="48">With the & HTML; check if your & HTML; -document of the syntax of & HTML; corresponding to all found errors are displayed. with this review, you can make sure your pages are displayed correctly by all browsers.</seg>
<seg id="49">Allows you to check your & CSS; style sheets included in a & HTML; - or & XHTML; -document. with valid & CSS, your web pages have a uniform appearance independent of the browser used.</seg>
<seg id="50">Check the links on your site to further lines and faulty links. recursively all links on the website are checked.</seg>
<seg id="51">Here are the addresses of the servers for checking your & HTML; -documents and & CSS; -Style sheets.</seg>

<seg id="55">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and your photos can be downloaded directly in & Edit; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the gphoto2 library. of course, any medium and every card reader that is supported by your operating system will work with & digicam; work together.</seg>
<seg id="56">& Edit; includes fast image editing with basic image editing tools. you can use them to view, comment, rate and correct your photos. the editing capabilities can be easily extended with KDE Image Plugins Interface (manual) modules.</seg>
<seg id="57">Although & digitized; easy to use, dozens of professional skills are available. it works completely in 16-bit color space and all available modules support shell conversion using libraw, DNG export and ICC color management workflow.</seg>
<seg id="58">Improved database with considerably more metadata, such as eg; via the camera or the lens that can be searched.</seg>
<seg id="59">Like all & kde; programs is also & digitized; an open source project. that means it depends on the support of the end-users. therefore, you should report problems and improvement possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="60">& digitized; try to make the reporting of problems or improvement suggestions as easy as possible for them. wherever you are in the program, the Help menu contains an entry problems or wishes... This will open a dialog with an underlined link. if you use these links, your web browser opens a page in the bug reporting system. all required information is already registered here. follow only the instructions to send your report.</seg>
<seg id="61">& digitized; is a project supported by a community. if you are a regular user of & digicam; if you are a regular user of & digicam; if you are a regular user of & digicam; then we would encourage you to answer questions to other users of & digicam; however, in this mailing list English is spoken, you should therefore be powerful in this language.</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also visit the digicode; homepage to learn news about released versions and other information about & digicam; to learn.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to join & digiplug; to participate is registration in the developer mailing list. instructions for logging in the developer mailing list of & digikam;.</seg>
<seg id="64">If you & Edit &gt; start for the first time, you'll be asked where to save your images and your database. you can specify a local, remote or remote folder here. simply enter the path name or click the folder icon folder icon to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field you need to specify a local folder on your computer. here the data file is stored. this path will remain the same for all image folders.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later you can add as many folders as you would like. & digitized; will also use as Albenbibliothek. settings digiKam set up collections</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a picture collection on your hard disk, you can specify the top folder that contains images, as a basic folder. & Edit each subfolder as an album. no picture will be changed. while the folder is searched, you will see a progress indicator like this:</seg>
<seg id="68">& Edit; durst recursively search the library path across its depth. you cannot exclude sub-folders unless it iste to hide in hidden folders. this can be done by placing a dot in front of the name of the subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder, you will notice that the albums in My Albenlist don't have photos as symbols. you can change this by using any photo from the album and put it on the folder icon. this will then be used as an album icon. see the Albums tab for more details.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you have configured the base folder, you can set up & digitize your digital camera. after that, you should learn how to use My Albums and My keyword list to manage your photos in the albums.</seg>
<seg id="71">Raw file support: if you are using the raw mode of your camera, this can & digitize; possibly also bypass this. support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help menu support.</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Roh-Decoder2 and Roh workflow.</seg>
<seg id="73">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and your photos can be downloaded directly in & Edit; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the gphoto2 library. of course, any medium and every card reader that is supported by your operating system will work with & digicam; work together.</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash; memory cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transmission. for actual transmission to the computer, the camera is often used as a USB mass storage device. the connection can also be realised via the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras may use the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">& digikam; uses the program gAudio2 for communication with digital camera. gPhoto 2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol, a widely used protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transmission of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need for additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the calculator. since photos are generally large files and are transmissions above the serial port slowly, this connection is now obsolete. & digikam; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of the images with gPhoto 2. see this link for a complete list of supported cameras.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphoto2 has to have been created with libexif support to reliably read the thumbnails of digiKam. if the Exif support is not present in libgphoto2, you may be unable to see thumbnails or the generation could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the nicest things to do & digitize is how easy it is to extend its functionality through modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI modules: the KDE Image Plugins Interface Project (manual) is an approach to develop a common module structure for & digicam; to develop KPhotoAlbum, Showimg and Gwenviews. the aim is to provide the modules to all graphics programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate images in virtually any way as a user can. their advantage is that it is much simpler, & digitized; by writing a small module to add a function when the changes in & digikam; even perform.</seg>
<seg id="81">To simplify the window, you can either remove the page strips with & LMB; remove or switch to full screen mode with F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F.</seg>
<seg id="82">Drag and drop pictures works everywhere: you can store a picture in another part of the tree, above the horizontal divider line or in another application window. the only restriction is that one image cannot be stored in keywords, date list or search.</seg>
<seg id="83">- A file type selector allows you to extract the most common formats: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, raw, movies and audio</seg>
<seg id="84">The text filter is used only for the fields currently displayed in the symbol view. so the filter on the filename only works if this is displayed in the symbol view. which fields can be displayed in the dialog of the AlbenSettings dialog.</seg>
<seg id="85">The View & quot; My Albeni stequot; provides an organized view of your photo albums. all the photos taken by & digikam are stored in a single album tree. these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were stored on the hard drive, according to the name of their collection in the album properties or after the date the album was created first. the date can be changed in the properties of the album.</seg>
<seg id="86">If you have created a scanner, you can also scan a photo directly into an album. select to scan pictures directly to an album. you can also add a screenshot directly to an album. select album Import screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="87">To copy or move an image from one album to another, you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it. in the then appearing menu, you have to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying. you can also move or copy several photos in the same way. simply select all the photos and move them to the target album.</seg>
<seg id="88">An album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to input information about this collection. to access the album properties, you need to right-click on the album and select album properties from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="89">Album collections: are a method to select your albums so that you can be grouped under a common name. selecting or deleting new collections by collection. if you want to add or delete new collections, you can do this in the settings for collections.</seg>
<seg id="90">The album date: used when you sort your albums by date with view albums by date.</seg>
<seg id="91">The buttons Elder, average, New Year: these put the date on that of the oldest, the newest picture or the average of the album. this will first try to calculate the average of the images from their EXIF information. if this fails, the date of the last change of each file is used in this folder instead.</seg>
<seg id="92">When you first have an album in & Edit, open, the first picture in the album will be selected as a symbol for the & quot; My Albenlistequot; this is meant to help you remember the photos in the album. sometimes the first photo on the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="93">To select another photo as an album icon, select the image with the right mouse button and select the Album & quot; As an album preview. in addition, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can only be included in a collection and collections cannot be nested.</seg>
<seg id="95">& digikam; supports entering keywords for individual photos in the area My keyword list at the bottom of the main window. album collections have a different effect. you can of course use both methods to organize your photos.</seg>
<seg id="96">The image window provides you with the main view of your photos. when you select an album, all images in this album are displayed in the image window. each photo is displayed in a preview, you can customize the size of this preview with the two magnifying buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="97">When you open an album for the first time, you need to wait short while the thumbnails are generated. you can avoid this by using the Extras Show All preview images from the Tools menu.</seg>
<seg id="98">Information on each image is displayed below the corresponding thumbnail. what information is this, you can edit settings digitized; change settings here. select the Albums tab and adjust the preview images to your preferences.</seg>
<seg id="99">The thumbnails have help windows that appear. if you leave the mouse pointer a moment over a picture. the help displays the most important features including all key words of a photo. the screenshot at the top of the section Introduction to the main window displays such an help window.</seg>
<seg id="100">Photos are everything with & digicam; works. albums and tags allow you to organize your pictures in the same way as it suits you. image editing displays your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to them. you can choose between viewing the images, a slide show or the editing of images.</seg>
<seg id="101">You can open the image editing with a photo by selecting either F4 image editing... or selecting the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and editing pane. in section digicam; image editing you will find instructions on how to edit your photos. with image editing, you can view and change your photos.</seg>
<seg id="102">It can happen that & digitized; the functionality you need is not available. you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the submenu of Open. for this, and how to customize it to your needs, if your program is not listed, you will find information in & kde; manual.</seg>
<seg id="103">You should note that after editing by other image editing software there may be problems with the metadata shown in the picture. some programs do not store this data with you when you save the changed image. thus, this information is lost from the EXIF and IPTC data, such as orientation, aperture etc.</seg>
<seg id="104">& digitized; provides two options for rotation. the easiest way is to click the thumbnail to preview and rotate. in sub-menu you can specify the degree of rotation.</seg>
<seg id="105">To change the filename of a photo, you can right-click on the preview and select F2 renaming from the context menu. keep in mind that you maintain the extension (.jpg, .tif, & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="106">If you want to delete a photo & edit it, it is moved to the trash bin of & kde; postponed. F8 Picture Delete or Delete If you prefer to really delete, you can use this by using Shift; Del.</seg>
<seg id="107">& quot; My Datumslistequot; organizes your photos using the data. & Edit; used for either the EXIF date or, if it is not available, the date of the last modification of the file.</seg>
<seg id="108">If you select a month from the list, all photos of this month are displayed in the image view. you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the date view so that you will only be shown the photos of the selected days.</seg>
<seg id="109">Photos with keywords provided a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos. tags are stickers that can be assigned individual photos or entire groups. once a keyword has been assigned to a photo, the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search.</seg>
<seg id="110">If a keyword is selected, all the photos marked with this keyword will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="111">Keywords can be sorted in a hierarchical tree. this allows you to organize your keywords logically. you can also fold up parts of the tree & quot; My key word listequot; so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for.</seg>
<seg id="112">The keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IPTC data fields of the image, at least for JPEG. so you can also use your keywords in other programs as soon as & digicam; the pictures are noticed.</seg>
<seg id="113">You can add new keywords by right-clicking either on & quot; My key word; or click on an existing keyword and then select a new keyword. if you have clicked on an existing keyword, this keyword will be added to the keyword of this keyword.</seg>
<seg id="114">You can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting Delete. if you delete a keyword, the photo itself will not be deleted. only the cue word is removed from this photo.</seg>
<seg id="115">You can change the position of a keyword by dragging it to the desired position in the tree and put it there. then a menu that gives you the possibility to move the keyword. a keyword can be at a time only once in the tree.</seg>
<seg id="116">You can change the properties of a keyword by clicking it with the right mouse button and selecting the keyword in the context menu. you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree & quot; My keywords.</seg>
<seg id="117">To select another photo as an album icon, select the image with the right mouse button and select Add as an album preview. in addition, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="118">To use this feature with keywords, you first have to add keywords. this can be done in two ways: once you have selected the photos you want to use with a keyword, you can click on the appropriate keyword in the tree & quot; My key word. alternatively, you can also click on the appropriate cue point in the tree & quot; My key word. alternatively, you can also click with the right mouse button on the preview of the images and select the cue point from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="119">You can select a photo with any number of keywords. the photo is displayed as soon as you select one of the words attributed to it. in this way you can give a cue for each person on a photo, one for the place where the photo was taken, one for the event it was made, etc.</seg>
<seg id="120">Once you have provided a photo with keywords, it will be displayed in the main window under the preview of the image.</seg>
<seg id="121">You can remove a keyword in which you can use the right mouse button to open the context menu of the photo and select Remove from the Tags menu. the menu displays only the keywords that have been assigned to the photo.</seg>
<seg id="122">The timeline view shows a time-dependent adjusted histogram of the number of images per time unit. a selection frame can be moved by this histogram. to select a timeframe you just have to click on the bottom rectangle of the box that indicates the time unit. this displays all associated images in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the field below you can enter a title and save your selection. this will appear in the list below.</seg>
<seg id="124">Include all elements of the database: names, ratings, keywords, keywords, albums, collections, date stamps and in the future even more.</seg>
<seg id="125">Secondary er Suchbox is a small lamp that is green when the search hits matches. if you click here, the filtering will be deleted and all pictures are displayed again. if The Search did not find, then the lamp becomes red.</seg>
<seg id="126">The advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left sidebar with the binoculars. if you open this you can save a simple search box as described above. you can save this search here but as a live search, which always filters what you entered as a search criterion. after you have saved the filter in the list.</seg>
<seg id="127">When you are satisfied with your selection, press OK and search will be done. the results will be displayed in My search list in the main window. if you want to change your selection after the search, you just need to select the corresponding entry from the View My search list and select an option in its context menu.</seg>
<seg id="128">When you select Edit Search, the search form will appear again with the search information you entered. if you select to edit Advanced search, the advanced search dialog appears to change your previous search. more information can be found in section The Search tool for Advanced search.</seg>
<seg id="129">If you want to delete an existing search from the list, select Delete from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="130">The Advanced search provides you with an advanced search form with many search parameters that you can search in specific fields of & Edit; s database.</seg>
<seg id="131">The list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Albendatabase. all rules are displayed in line, separated by operators. an option can be added to this list with search group / Search group or deleted from it. additionally, you can create searching for type & quot; AND NICHTquot;.</seg>
<seg id="132">& digitized; characterizes each image by a long number with a special technique, the hair algorithm. this allows to compare pictures by comparing these signatures. the smaller the difference between two signatures, the more they conform. this technique is applied in three areas.</seg>
<seg id="133">Similar entries: this is an area in which you can drop each image to find a similar. by means of a Schwellert, the result selection can be enlarged or reduced. if you slide a picture from anywhere on the icon of the inaccurate search in the left sidebar, it will open and you can drop it there.</seg>
<seg id="134">Sketch: free hand colour sketches: draw a quick sketch and digitize; find the matching pictures. also here a threshold value can be set.</seg>
<seg id="135">This tab provides an intuitive card search tool based on the Marble mini program. you can move in or out with the mouse wheel or hold it and move it. move it while you press the left mouse button. all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed. this of course presupposes that your images contain geo-data.</seg>
<seg id="136">In the field below you can specify a name for your geo filter, which will then be added for later use of the list below. it works like a Live Geofolder.</seg>
<seg id="137">& digitized; provides a luminaire in a separate window with which you can easily compare pictures. it works with all supported image file formats, including raw files.</seg>
<seg id="138">Select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use Ctrl; L Add to the luminaire from the context menu. the selection will be added to the luminaire and its window opens. if you are back in & Edit; main window, you can quickly open the luminaire with L extras.</seg>
<seg id="139">From the preview bar you can drag the images you want to compare to the left or right pane of the window and place them there. a small arrow shows you which copy in which window area is visible. if you want to preview synchronize out of the toolbar and perform zooming operations on one of the images, then they are also executed on the other image. so you can compare the same area of the two images.</seg>
<seg id="140">Another mode is better suited to quickly select from a series of images. if you navigate with pairs from the toolbar, then the two first images will be automatically loaded into the fields to the left. the right-click image is displayed in the right pane. this simplifies it through a number of similar images.</seg>
<seg id="141">Of course the normal delete actions also work directly from the luminaire like e.g. F4 file Edit...</seg>
<seg id="142">All image information from the right sidebar of the main window is available for both thumbnails. this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data.</seg>
<seg id="143">At the bottom of each area you will find a built-in pivot function that you can see on the crossed arrows. in order to wave the visible area of the image, you need to click it and hold the & LMB; then both images will display the same image area.</seg>
<seg id="144">The zooming works just as in other views. just use the zoom slider under the pictures or Ctrl; scroll wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out. this happens in both images when you are in the preview mode.</seg>
<seg id="145">What is a digital inventory management - apart from the fashion word? digital inventory management considers every part of the process as follows after the image has been taken up to the final output and permanent storage. each of us records, scans or digital photos stores a form of digital inventory management. most of us do this however not in a systematic and efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="146">We give you a tool, a plan and practical tips on how to back up, find, protect and use photos again. we look at downloading, renaming, removing, converting, grouping, backing up, optimizing, waiting and exporting image files.</seg>
<seg id="147">& quot; Digital inventory management assumes, indexed, categorized, secures, searches, transforms, confectioned and exports content that has a monetary or cultural value. quot;</seg>
<seg id="148">Metadata is defined as data on data. metadata is, according to your definition, data that provides information about or documentation of other data that are managed by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">I dare to say if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer then you will need no longer inventory management to find a specific photo. if you don't even know how many photos you have, then you certainly do not use & digikam;. if you don't even know how many photos you have, then you certainly do not use & digikam;. the approach to store the metadata in a database as well as in the image files guarantees very fast searching and secure archiving on which you can freely access other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate something into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure. your image files must be organized somehow on your computer. you must decide if you want to save them to a dedicated drive or on a network drive & etc; make sure that you will have to switch to a larger drive sometime.</seg>
<seg id="151">You may be happy with this structure. holiday pictures can be quickly found on your location unless you were in a year several times at the same place. if you make enough photos then you will use subfolders like & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc. then export a folder for images you print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements such as versioning of photos, archiving, workflows, constant supply of images to different topics and a large number of everything. within 10 years 95% archives and 5% work files will have and you will then not want to reorganize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files fit together? separating file types makes batch processing easier. disconnect new files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or derivative image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend saving metadata in the settings page of the metadata in & Edit; this ensures that EXIF and IPTC data are written into the file. if you forget this, you can subsequently save the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the appropriate point in the Album View menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change what? to do this, & digikam, giving them a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are, of course, the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the actual work begins, since you should now assign each photo keywords, captions and an evaluation. of course, you can select all the images that need the same attribute and set the value then. this makes sense because you can focus on the best photos in further work.</seg>
<seg id="158">Now let us use keywords, keywords, as you often say in other programs, or categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import catalogued images from another source with embedded keyword, then & Edit them; automatically build the tree for you or insert the images to the right place. resort the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can simply be done by dragging a sub-tree to another. the changed key words are edited by & digicam; updated as it tracks the subtrees.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphic shows how different metadata overlap. this is a very rough representation since each block of metadata consists in truth out of many sections. file names and calendar data are properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords - the next section refers to captions or comments, the third important tool to catalog your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You don't want to let anybody see your photos simply, you want to share them with your friends, family, photographers and agencies. you are certainly interested in how your photos arrive.</seg>
<seg id="163">Look at this panorama. from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you consider it closer then you start to see some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I'm telling you this is the landing place of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandy 60 years after the landing is. wow! you begin to dream of having associations, memories, the historical span is again present, you may even hear the silence. thus, the caption has changed your perception of this panorama completely.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others looking at your photos, the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest. if you show pictures you should tell a story. remember, the key is to transfer the meaning to the viewer, help Him over the motive that you moved has to understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine if an image is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a label for itself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & Edit, you can save as much text, in an internationalized alphabet (UTF-8), as labeling. you can even set it for a selection of images simultaneously. KDE even exports you a spell checker. if you export your images in web galleries, then these labels will not tell you a second time for publishing.</seg>
<seg id="168">Do you remember the times before GPS? when you had to find another city without a navigation system? was it not a boring planet in front of GoogleEarth? well, because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation is already moving with speed of light.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities to exploit the geolocation are innumerable and will be even more poignant in the future. I am sure that one day, in the near future, you can virtually repeat your journeys using pictures with geographic information. & digikam, you can also export kml files that you can open with Google Earth. you can also export the images to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc; with the GoogleMaps viewer.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a word game with copyright and denotes the practice of using copyrights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies. the same freedoms are also applicable in all changed versions, so also for the work of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you what information in the setup page of & digicam; should be stored as information:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for creator and author): this field should contain your name, or the name of the person who created the photo. if it is not desired to use the name of the photographer, for example to protect the name of the photographer, then the name of a company or organization can be used.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author's title (synonym for the author): linked to the author. this field contains the name of the photographer. examples of this may be titles such as: employee photographer, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer. since this is a copyright notice, this must also be completed.</seg>
<seg id="174">Editor (synonym for providers): use the provider field to identify who offers the photo. this does not necessarily have to be the author. if the photographer is a photo agency like Reuters or Associated Press, then these organisations can be listed here, which you offer the picture to others. if the picture is a stock photo, then the group / agency that offers the picture here is given here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, although they do not provide protection against abuse. anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with calculator can delete or modify them in the picture. for private persons, this is very important for the majority of your photos. for professionals and semi-professionals, this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique per picture. & digitized; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: disk failures, disk failures, power surges, ECC, transmission errors, ageing of storage media, recovery, redundancy, desasterprevention, lifetime, temperature, data size, spread superstitions</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course, we don't talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or a fire. these kinds of losses are the same ones that can happen to you even with traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section, it's about problems with the so-called New Media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll onTRACK, the world's largest data recovery company, has some interesting statistics which causes data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">To combat the problem with CDs / DVDs, these must be handled carefully and you can no longer be trusted as a couple of years. of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which will last longer, harder to get and much more expensive. there are offers about gold coated DVDs, & dollar; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years for yourself.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD discs can be unreadable, but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way. the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write much more reliable. so it's about choosing the right DVD.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to errors, even if you have just been written. that's why they use a control sum mechanism to protect themselves. 75% of the data is only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and control summing. despite this massive protection they age by chemical aging, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc;</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs, there is a convenient program called IsoBuster that seems to work miracles on CDs and DVDs. it runs under Windows and & Linux; it runs under Windows and & Linux; it is also not available for Macs. there are also similar applications to read damaged data from damaged disks, hard drives, flash media, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray discs seem to capture the format war against the HD DVD. a dual layer Blu-ray disc can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8.5 GB. all that was said to CDs and DVDs is of course also applicable to the Blu-ray disc.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn slowly with a good recording device on high-quality media in a non-propriate format. then read the data again to check you. likewise, you should copy the media with a description, date & author labels and then store them on a clean, dark dry and protected site. do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read the media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Disk manufacturers keep your statistics for themselves. your manufacturers' warranties cover a new disk but not the data. Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives: disclaimer</seg>
<seg id="187">In short: disks keep the longest when operating in temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. The error rate is dramatic. electronic parts of the controller are the most common error reason, SMART can not detect these errors. some of the errors detected by SMART herald the impending failure. these are in particular read errors and publishing counters. the expected life time is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete loss due to overvoltage. of course, you can also lose data loss due to a power failure before you have secured the files, but these losses can normally be recovered without any major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electrical devices do not account much, the devices with computer chips and high speed processors are different. these can cause serious damage. these anomalies can cause serious damage. on your computer, these anomalies can cause complete data loss, hardware ageing, destroyed motherboards and other defects. so protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most common protection against blackheads is overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs a part of the energy heat and grounding the rest. it is usually available in the form of a connector bar. remember, however, that not every connector bar also contains overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, you should make sure that it meets the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also make sure that it offers protection against lightning strikes and thus protects the properly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since an overvoltage of each cable can be used to your computer, you should make sure that all peripheral devices connected to your system are protected. this also applies to telephone lines and cable modems as well. some manufacturers provide overvoltage protection that also includes a telephone connection for your modem. others offer connectivity to the coaxial cable of the cable modem and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a laptop, then you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are specially developed for notebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem.</seg>
<seg id="194">While an overvoltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines it will not really help you in a complete failure. even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irreplaceable data. it may therefore be useful to invest in a uninterrupted power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to the protection against overvoltages, these devices can automatically provide battery energy when a power failure occurs. this gives you the possibility to save your data and run the system in order. if you buy a UPS, you should be sure that it meets the same quality requirements as a surge protection. furthermore, the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed and compare its security in case of electric trouble with the cost of avoiding this. a high quality overvoltage protection can get you up to & euro; 20 costs, A 500W UPS you can pay for less than & euro; 20. finally, remember how well your computer is protected with it. finally, remember to always remember all cables before you go on holiday.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration, you can use it as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software. Google Shared Storage is another popular offer that allows you to store any amount of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">They are, however, very expensive compared to the hard drives - 40 GB costs & dollar; 75 per year and 400 GB costs & dollar; 500. in addition, you must send the data on the comparatively slow internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images. it is not a bad solution, but it is not a general securing solution.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com provide online storage services that are given on photos. their free storage is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online. the professional version provides you more, in case of Flickr dramatically more. for $25 per year you get unlimited storage, which should be verified in reality first.</seg>
<seg id="201">The web solutions are very safe from the point of view of the data backup. due to the TCP protocol, transmission errors are automatically cleaned and the large companies offer a backup and a distributed memory.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram shows the elements of the transmission chain in the machine. all transfers are susceptible to transmission errors. the file system ZFS and btrfs provide at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing about it is that nobody tells you when a transmission error occurred, not when this happened in your hardware. all these disorders remain undetected until you have one day open a photo and this is destroyed for your surprise. nobody seems to have ever thought about it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer path than that in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses, since they generate interferences within the data streams. in normal file systems, these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. you will see thousands of mistakes a year already in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS of Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates who can deal with disk defects on a low level and are highly Scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under a GPL incompatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it will soon also be available for Linux, and Windows. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has started its own initiative with its btrfs file system. this is still in alpha state. it uses the same protection mechanisms that uses ZFS and is also available for Linux; it is not yet a part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of data loss on notebooks and 46% for workstation systems. notebooks already account for 50% of thefts.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think. it leads to a lower damage, as for example thefts or new installations. and it is currently restricted to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; no one has been sighted for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less prone to data loss than proprietary systems: incorrect, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFs and XFS to name the broadened file systems. you can find a very good English article here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: incorrect, only the speed of the investigation process is higher and an undefined status is avoided. however, if a file was not stored completely before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the biggest threat to digital data: false, theft and human error are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are 1-2 stop settings from fundamental physical boundaries. it is meant that while the technology continues to develop, there is a natural limit for this progress. sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go towards 10 megapixel sensors. even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is worse. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 megapixels. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 megapixels. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 megapixels. for higher resolution, you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">You get a 750GB hard drive today for 100 & euro; so do not blame anybody for data loss. 6% of all PCs are affected every year by data loss. so, secure your data after a plan and test this backup before you make any dangerous like reinstalling your operating system, the replacement of disks or the resizing of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make daily your fuses on an external SATA drive. if, then one day, a lightning strikes you if the drive was not connected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster strikes locally and destroys a lot. forget an airplane disaster: fire, water, electricity, children and thefts are dangerous enough for your data. they usually concern a whole room or the entire house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore disaster prevention is always a non-local storage. bring your fuses up the stairs to the neighboring house, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as said above is a common reason for data loss despite safeguarding the panic. if you have a backup which is not immediately available, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files to be backed up. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup. generates a complete snapshot at two time points: the complete backup and the last differential backup.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. generates multiple snapshots. you can restore the original state at any time in which such a backup was made. this backup comes with a versioning system closest to the exception that it is only scanned and not continuous.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines. unlike script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts, rsync only copies the difference of files that have actually been changed. this is compressed and if you want to increase security over ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Save important images directly after you have saved them on your computer on a DVD or other optical media.</seg>
<seg id="225">This procedure allows you enough time to discover and restore losses. at the same time, you come for backup but with & lt; 130% of the size of the working files. at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month. any further dilution should be done manually after which you have made a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Themes: metadata, IPTC data stored in the image file, retained XMP files, original, memory, scalability, media, reinventing images and metadata, copying images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, visual equipment,..., using the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">So that valuable pictures will survive the next 40 years that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">As the future is unpredictable due to your nature, you must observe and re-evaluate everything that is being said today. unfortunately, there is no other possibility as a certain vigilance. every 5-8 years you should ask yourself how the current system is backwards compatible. the less variants you have used in the past, the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document. use or switch to open standards supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is available for everyone nowadays. so if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the advice is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, your storage and security technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the specialist print for the possibility to change a system in its size. this actually means increasing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have planned the scalability and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition. for * nix systems like & Linux, you can copy this area and relocate it to a new disk:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmesg if your new disk has been recognized by the system but do not hang it.</seg>
<seg id="235">& dollar; dd if = / dev / sdb / sdb / sdc # source is / dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdc & dollar; parted resize / dev / sdc & dollar; parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; resize resize / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; resize2fs / dev / sdc # resize2fs / dev / sdc # resize2fs / dev / sdc # resize2fs / dev / sdc # source changed when needed</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification. even if one day there is no more software which can read it, you can create it yourself. this task will be easier from year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that slowly disappears from the market. you should therefore no longer use it.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG has been developed as an open source standard to replace GIF. it can store much more. it is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16-bit per color channel and full transparency. PNG can recommend gamma and chromaticity data for improved color assignment on heterogeneous platforms. the disadvantage is that it is relative many administrative information, but not as many as TIFF requires and a slow compression.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF has been widely used as picture format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with a lossless compression algorithm (Deflates). it manages images in high quality, but requires very large files. with some cameras, you can store your images in this format. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digital Negative File Format is a royalty-free and open image format developed by Adobe Systems. DNG has been developed due to the need to unify camera ressources. it is now available on the TIFF / EP format and committed to using metadata. a handful of camera manufacturers now provide DNG and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon will use it sometime.</seg>
<seg id="241">This is possibly one of the reasons why, around 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML based XMP technology to replace the & quot; Image resource block quot; technology of the 90s. XMP stands for & quot; Extensible Metadata platform quot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. it is a label technology that allows users to embed their data into a file. the file information is stored with the extension & quot; .xmpquot; stored for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers draw it from an original of your recording, mostly in raw format, to archive. XMP is suitable as it stores the metadata separately from the image file. however, you should think about whether you use DNG as a container and put everything there together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards, supporting a wide range of applications and business models. DCMI's activities include work on architecture and modeling, discussions and collaborative work in DCMI communities, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and educational efforts to achieve a widespread acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import pictures from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long as the images on the camera image are, you can use this as a temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert your raw files to DNG and save them to your raw archive. this function is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a finite processing you can use external programs. if you re-edit the images with & Edit, then you should add the metadata again. these were sometimes truncated by the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the edited pictures for copyright with a digital watermark. then export them into web galleries, code them to MPEG, use in contact sheets, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to edit your photos in & Edit. in the section Adding a Photo to an Album, you will find a description of how you can add photos that you already have on your hard drive. however, the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for importing images to your legacy database.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digicam; connect these to the computer, connect the camera to the display mode and turn it on. you will find a further description in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, it attempts to connect to your camera. for some cameras this may take a while. if the connection is established, a finished indicator appears at the bottom end and the thumbnails of all photos on the camera are displayed. some cameras do not display thumbnails. if this is the case, the file names and a symbol are displayed for any file, photos, movies, music, etc. on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before downloading the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information for each entry. with the page bars properties and metadata from the camera interface you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog displays file properties and photo information that are internally stored by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer. note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The tab metadata displays the internal metadata such as exif, manufacturer's note, GPS etc. of the image. this information is the same as in the metadata sidebar from the main window of & digicam; or image editing. note that this metadata is not available in some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is click the Download button and then download the selection of All. this will not delete all photos from your camera into a single album in & Edit;. when downloading, the photos are not deleted and we recommend you to check if the pictures were securely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you do not want to download all photos, you can select only the desired ones with the default selection methods from & kde. once you have selected the photos, use the Download button and then download Selected. the selected download button will be downloaded as long as you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, an option New download is available. these images have not yet been digitized by & Edit. in this case, the new images are marked with a star in the preview window. if you choose this option, only the new images will be downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">When you download the Select All or Selected CD buttons, a dialog will appear with which you can select the destination folder where the photos are stored. the list of existing albums will be shown in the My Albums tab. then select the destination album from the list and click OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After selecting the target album, press OK, and & Edit; load the photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete all at once by removing the Delete All button. if you only want to delete some, you need to select them first and then delete selected deleted.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there is no way to restore photos you deleted from the camera. the photos will not be moved to the garbage dump of & kde; they will be deleted completely. so, you should carefully check if the photos were successfully deleted from the camera. if you want to completely erase the camera finder, you should do so using the camera, as this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">The filenames are usually re-used after the photos were deleted from the camera. this can lead to double filenames if you load photos from different recording sets into the same album. therefore, it may be useful to integrate the date and time the image has been made into the filename.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for rotating and mirroring the image and for datas-based sub-albums. if you use this latter option, a folder per day will be created automatically.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options During the transfer opens three more options that are performed before the photos are stored on the disk. the first two relate the data about the author in the section Standard Autoritisation. if you select this, the corresponding entries will be copied from the Exif information into the IPTC fields. with the last option you can correct date & time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">If you want a different date format than the default format, you can use the prefix Photo-% Y-% -% d% d:% H:% M:% S in the editing field. to do so, turn on the Date & Time option. for more customizations, read the strftime command.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the option camera file name, you have the option to change the file names in lowercase. or in upper case letters if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new file name, the & digicam; used for a photo, is displayed below the name that the camera provides in preview. your settings for renaming will be saved and used automatically when you next time open the camera window.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digitized; can use all information about the orientation of the camera to the time point recording to perform automatic rotation during shutdown. not all cameras provide this information. in the section page bar metadata, you can read more details about the information that your camera embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is usually switched on, and if your camera does not deliver this information, & digicam; the photo in the original orientation. if you want to turn off the automatic turn, use the Advanced button and select the Automatic Rotation in the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera provides information about the date on which the photo was taken, it can & digikam; use this to automatically download sub-albums in the target album. all images with the same date are loaded into the same sub-album. not all cameras provide this information. in the section page bar Meta data, you can readjust what information your camera could have embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is normally off and saved & digitized in this case; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this, you need to switch this option. use the Advanced button and select the date-based sub-albums at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is to download. then select Upload. the file selection dialog and kde; appears where you can select the files to be uploaded. you can also select more than one file with the default & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done, & digikam, you where the images should be uploaded. select the folder you want and click OK to start the upload. the images will not be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a generic term in this document. it refers to a position indicated in longitude and latitude and can be displayed on a map. the data can be determined by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European GALILEO or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers, it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location. not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatically receiving the GPS data. environmental planners, military, police, architecture offices and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you have forgotten where exactly the photo was taken, you can open a browser with a click that shows the area. if you want to send a postcard to another & digicam; users who want to locate the location of the photo, or simply want to document this aspect, it is good to save the position data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is, how do the GPS data come into the picture? first, you should know that exiv2 supports many GPS data fields, such as direction, saddle and map references. so, the question is actually more than the data entered into these fields? there are at least three ways to achieve this. directly with the right hardware, via a post-processing of GPS data and image files with the KIPI module for geographical attribution (manual) and last via manual input of known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit. but there are a few who work with GPS receivers. either as card module or by transmitting the data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with gpsd or gpsbabel. however, you have to save these data in the gpx format, as this is the only format supported by the geo-mapping module.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are different programs for & Windows; and Mac OS which can extract and correlate the data of images and from GPS. on the following page you can do the same under & Linux; make: gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the longitude and latitude or other data, you can use this script that works with the ExifTool from Phil Harvey. it uses the accidentals of hairy coordinates created by maps.google for example.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com does not show European street maps. here are some European sites, at least in French, German and Spanish which show all navigation details for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">& digitized; attempts to give you so much control over its work processes as possible. there are many settings that change the behavior of & Edit; select Settings dialog. the Settings dialog is divided into eight pages. you can switch between these by clicking on the icons of the left-hand side.</seg>
<seg id="284">Select action can be displayed on Embedded preview or start image editing. you set the default behavior of & Edit; fixed when you click on an entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the standardization and copyright data. these data are automatically written to the corresponding IPTC data fields when the option is selected when downloading from the camera interface. also for database synchronization these data are written in the IPTC fields.</seg>
<seg id="286">Author's title is a synonym for the author's line: this field should contain the professional description of the photographer. this can be names such as a photographer, freelance photographer or an independent, commercial photographer. since this is a more detailed description of the author field, this must also be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Publisher is a synonym for providers: use this field to specify the photo. this does not need to be the author if this is for a news agency, such as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations should be entered here as they provide the picture to others & quot;. if the image is a bearing photo, then the group or agency that provides the image should be listed here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC actions store the data in the corresponding IPTC rims. this ensures that the metadata is permanently contained in the image and not only in the database of & digikam; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported into & digitized; imported without getting lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Save captions as embedded tags (JFIF) in JPEG images: this synchronizes the comments you add to your photos, with the captions embedded in the images. note: images that already contain labels will be overwritten by digitizing them.</seg>
<seg id="290">The Settings page contains all the options for the information that appears when the cursor is in the main window over a file. depending on the option selected, this information will be displayed or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; digitized; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats. to specify which file types & digikam, you can add and remove the file extensions of this list. any file in one & Edit; album folders that will not have any of these extensions, by & digicam; ignored.</seg>
<seg id="292">You can reset the default settings again by pressing the Refresh button on the right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The settings of the luminaire by & Edit; can be set to default values on this page. each time you then open the illuminated table, these settings are switched on if possible. however, some pictures have different sizes and the synchronous mode is then not available. if you have one, then you can get better viewing results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, image editing uses a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select it here. you can turn off the toolbar if you use image editing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and underexposed areas of an image can be marked with darker or light color in the image. these colors are set here. in the image processing, this View Mode can be switched on and off with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma-Subsampling it is meant that the images are encoded in a higher resolution of luminance than in the color information. please read this article in Wikipedia for a closer explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With the view of PNG compression, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce the image quality since PNG utilizes a lossless algorithm. if you have a fast machine, you can set this value to a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the option to compress TIFF files you can switch the default compression algorithm for TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. it has no effect on image quality since the default algorithm works lossless.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the Settings loss-free JPEG 2000 files, you can save loss-free. even if you select the lossy settings, the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than with normal JPEG. when this paragraph has been written, metadata has not yet been supported but was in the planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In previous versions of & Edit, image editing was only a picture viewer for photos. currently, it quickly develops into a tool for manipulating your photos. with this dialog you can change the settings of image editing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The standard acceptance is that all green pixels are the same. if you are sensitive to ultraviolet light when the pixels are sensitive to ultraviolet light, this difference creates a lattice pattern in the output. if you use this option, solve this problem with a minimal loss of details. this option marks the image a bit soft, but eliminates the 2x2 lattice pattern with the VNG- or AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white balance of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the automatic colour balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used when the white balance is not set. standard is a fixed color balance based on a white card that was photographed in sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that underexposed pictures get more details in the top lights in four steps. for other cameras, this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is the pointed-out lights, so the parts of your images which are burned out due to the inability of your camera to capture the skylights as a continuous white. finally, you can try to reconstruct some parts of the missing information from the reapers.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels are generally not as fast as green and red. & digikam; and dscw therefore try to reconstruct the missing green and red portions from the yet unsaturated blue pixels. of course, this is a question how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">When selecting the Reconstruction option, you get the possibility to set a level. here, a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be adjusted individually for each picture.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the luminance value according to your taste. you probably need to set it slightly higher than standard 1. however, this can also be done later in the image options of & digicam; image editing. to keep the time for the demosaicing small, you should proceed conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A Demosaicing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture of the partial raw data generated by the color filtered image sensor that has many cameras and which provides a matrix of colored pixels. this algorithm is also known as CFA interpolation or color construction.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digikam; and Dcraw provides you three alternatives: bilinear, VNG Interpolation and AHD Interpolation. after some tests it looks like AHD Interpolation (for Adaptive Homogenous Directed) was the first algorithm used by Dcraw. it creates color artefacts on the edges. bilinear is interesting if you are looking for a fast solution with an acceptable result.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color deviation of your lenses you can set the red and blue correction values here. this is certainly the best method for a color grading correction since it is performed during the conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color information and gives instructions how to re-exist. there is also LCMS and & Edit; information such as the color information from one color space to translate into the other is to make the colors as accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior Questions when an image opens in image editing / Start color management module with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color Profile Folder Sets the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / / home / user / .color / ICC, where you can save all your profiles. & digitized; examine this folder then during startup.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of the ICC-Profiles You have here the option & quot; standard squot; for your profiles, everything can be changed later when opening the raw file.</seg>
<seg id="316">The color management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here are only your pictures color managed not the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should fit to the camera manufacturer and model you use. not all profiles are created in the same way. there are some, such as Canon, which do not contain color mapping or gamma correction. currently, dscw Gamma doesn't correct conversions at 16 bit depth. this means that you have to do the mapping itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options such as the Soft Proof Profile that you can emulate as your image would be returned from a device. this is very useful before you print a picture as your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors therefore can work very saturated. this could be manually corrected instead of relying on the blind algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras, it is quite obvious which colour profile is intended for. unfortunately, not with the models from Canon. therefore, here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together. of course, this answer is inofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile extension makes it possible to recognize the style for the goal: F for an exact style, L for landscapes, N for Neutral, P for portrait and S for the standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; image plugin interface. it is an interface that is supported by a number of & kde; image viewer and image editing. by providing this interface it can & digikam; many modules support that are written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed the KIPI modules, you will see a list of available modules. select the ones you want to use, and these will then be loaded by & digicam; loaded. these modules appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition you will find some also in the context menu of the preview.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings Short commands.</seg>
<seg id="324">Further information (in English) via KIPI modules can be obtained via the KIPI project under http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The settings of the slide show should be easy to understand. the upper knob adjusts the time between the transitions, usually 4-5 seconds are good. the other check boxes turn the metadata on or off, which are displayed at the bottom of the images while the ad is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera characteristics show on the left side a list of all cameras currently supported. on the right side there is a button Automatic detection, which tries to identify a camera that is connected to the computer. if you want to use this, make sure the camera is properly connected, turned on and in balance mode.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom, you can set the path for USB and FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) -mass storage cameras. this field is only active if you have selected a USB or FireWire mass storage camera from the camera list. you must specify the path, / mnt / camera or / mnt / para, on which you mount your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & digicam; to use, you need to connect the camera to your computer, bring it into the display mode and turn it on.</seg>
<seg id="329">Check if & Edit; the camera automatically detects. if not, you can set camera models and port manually. after you have set up your camera, your camera will appear in the camera menu.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera. it is displayed in the main window of the main window. if you have more than one camera, you can insert it here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the Option confirmation dialog for moving &gt; Show images in the Mülleimer display, you can adjust the dialog by & Edit; set a photo in an album when deleting a photo. in the sections deleting a photo and deleting an album, you will find more details.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes by the right sidebar can be tacitly using & digicam; apply if you use the option to apply changes in the right sidebar without prompting. otherwise, you need to save the changes with the button changes.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also display & digitize the welcome screen display; under certain circumstances, this accelerates the start of & digitizing;.</seg>

<seg id="336">These designs have been defined in simple text files. if you are interested in creating a new design for & digicam; to create, you will find more information about this in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& Edit &gt; includes fast image editing with some basic tools. you can use them to view your photos and for correction and improvement. image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by selecting the item Show / Edit.</seg>
<seg id="338">The image editing contains a number of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & digicam; so you may not be part of your distribution. for more information on the KIPI modules, see Setting up the Image Processing section.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status bar at the bottom of the window displaying the file name, current file number, magnification factor and the current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top and below the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently required functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">Editing functions of image editing change your photos. however, none of the features will change the original photo before using File Save or the Save button from the toolbar. note that you can no longer restore the original photo once you have saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">You might want to make a copy of your image before you change it. this can be done with File Save as.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by restoring from the File menu or using the Recover Recover button restoring in the toolbar. you then lose any change you have done on the photo since the last saving.</seg>
<seg id="344">Almost every image processing action can be undone or restored. the last action can be undone by editing or restoring reverting or restoring from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you use this frequently, you should use the keyboard shortcut, Ctrl, -Z to undo and Ctrl; -Shift-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you press the & LMB; click on the return or restore button in the toolbar for a moment, you will receive a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions in between will also be undone or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started image editing, you can move between the photos in the same album or keyword by dragging the navigation buttons in the toolbar, image high, image, or the entries in the File menu. if you have made changes to the current photo, you will be asked if you want to save them.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can enter the photo in and out in which you use Ctrl; mouse wheel or the icons in the toolbar or the entries in the View menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To customize a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: select the magnification factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full Screen mode displays the picture in full screen mode. you come into the normal view where you use the Esc key. if you do not want this, you can change this in the Settings dialog by & Edit. this allows you to view this in the Settings dialog by & Edit. this can be viewed from & Edit; main Window. see the section for setting up image editing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can select the image from the File menu and get the standard & kde; print dialog. you can customize the settings here before printing your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu, you can print single images or whole sets. whole picture preview pages can be printed from your selection. you just need to select the images with the standard methods and select Print Assist from the File menu. if you follow the wizard, you just need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The & digitized; main window has a sidebar at the right edge, which provides important information and actions for the selected images. the same side bar is available without the navigation file, even in the editing pane. it is displayed when one of the five tabs is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple clicking on the same tab allows the sidebar to appear or disappear into the margin again.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the label view, you can enter or insert labels with unlimited size. note the note below. the text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed. the labels are copied to EXIF and IPTC fields so that you can be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are truncated after 2000 characters and special characters are converted. if you want to use the IPTC labelling field in other applications, you should consider these restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you have commented on, use either the Apply button or simply switch to the next image, the labels are then saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">In addition to the user button, there is a button More. with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database. however, you can also write the metadata into the files. however, this will always be done if you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written in the images.</seg>
<seg id="359">The review section shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting. it can be applied either by a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + 0... 5. the rating from the sidebar is always applied to one image. to evaluate multiple images simultaneously, select it and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The rating is written in the Regency IPTC field. coding will follow the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword review shows a search box for filtering the keywords, the keyword tree and a selection box with the keywords used previously in this & digitized; session.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search word. you can quickly limit the number of options when searching for a keyword. this feature is particularly useful if you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom of the screen is a further relief in the input of keywords in a series of pictures. if you have entered different keywords, these are stored for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by selecting the appropriate check boxes in the tree. all key words of an image are stored in the keyword keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If multiple images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword tree, this will only be applied to the highlighted image and not the entire selection. if you want to select a selection with a keyword, please read the section Keyword Filters section.</seg>
<seg id="366">The keyword filter page bar is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window. normally, the left side bar is used with their Album, - Data-, keyword and search views. if additionally one or more keyword filters are used from the right-hand side, only the intersection of these two is displayed. all created keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also drag and drop keywords in the main view. if the keyword already exists, you can simply drag it from the right sidebar and place it on the selection. then, a dialog box will appear which asks you if you want to set the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example, the main window displays the images on a calendar day. the keyword filter represents no keywords, which reduces the amount to three images. they were selected using Ctrl + a, and then a keyword is drawn from the right keyword tree to the selection and stored there. a dialog asks if this keyword should be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place at every start of the program. it can also be turned off in Settings Miscellaneous.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have created and created a rule and notice that it should be one or two, you can change this easily by double-clicking on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry after which is searched in the database. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, key word, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can set an Advanced search on all elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the group group. the options will then look like this:</seg>

<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was mainly written by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I mainly edited it & edited it concrete implementation.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why you use a color-managed workflow is that the colors used by your camera or scanner will have a predictable variance from the ones actually photographed or scanned. with a color-managed workflow, you can achieve that the colors on your monitor are similar to those of your camera or scanner and the colors that you print or publish on the web that correspond with your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the theme appears on color management, everyone wants to know which buttons he has to press for the results he wants. unfortunately, color management means that you make informed decisions at any point of the image processing workflows. in addition, links with deeper information will allow you to make your own informed decisions so you can get the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below, you don't have to worry about color management.</seg>
<seg id="380">They work on a monitor which is calibrated to the sRGB colour space. (more information can be found below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other picture editions are by e-mail or the web, where sRGB is de facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB functions so well and makes life so easy for everyone, why should one use another color space and have to worry about color desolation?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of the limitation of sRGB compared to the colors we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors we can see, the horseshoe region, and the colors in sRGB color space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2 dimensional representation of sRGB with some bigger color spaces, please visit Bruce Willibloom's excellent site and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I need to tallize my monitor if I chose to work in sRGB color space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you are working in the sRGB color space or not, you need to calibrate your monitor, since sRGB turns out that your; onitor is on sRGB. if you are working as RGB, you either need to calibrate your monitor to the sRGB standard, use a suitable monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections, which can improve a picture in most cases. therefore use it before attempting any further manual editing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions Normalize, Balance, Automatic balancing and contrast extend from the menu Correct Automatic correction try to make the best of your colors. you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scales the luminous intensity values over the entire image, so that the darkest point is black and the brightest dot is as bright as possible without changing its color shade. this function is often a magic correction for images which are dark or washed.</seg>
<seg id="391">Compare: this method adjusts the intensity factor of the color of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity channel is as flat as possible. this results in nearly every brightness area the same number of pixels. this results in a very powerful operation, which either causes miracles in an image or destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic adjustment: this method maximizes the color range in the red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and light border tones and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram range.</seg>
<seg id="393">Augmenting contrast: this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the highest possible area and a new jib of all values in between. this is only visible with washed pictures and can be a good correction for poor photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digitized; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white balance correction is somewhat limited because of a color space of 8 bits per color. if you can be too far from the original image, you can perform overexposure zones. if you can perform the white balance in raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, then your options for correction will be better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by copyrighted Pawel T. Jochowa. they start using the menu entry colors white balance of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left you can see both the original picture and the preview of the target image. the preview is dynamically adjusted to the settings of the tool. if you want to see the original whitish, then click on the subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="398">The thumbnail of the target image has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel below this marker is shown as a vertical line in histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">To the right the histogram shows that dynamically changed once you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful since, even in well lit pictures, most pixels have very small luminance values. with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed. the sum is called luminance.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your score depends on shadow, saturation and gamma. shadow adjustment lets you improve or even dim the shadow details of your photos.</seg>
<seg id="401">To play with the above checks, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the color temperature of the white balance. in this way, the temperature and green values are automatically set.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white balance with the list of default settings. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed. you will see the combined result in white balance. this is indicated in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The Save as and Loading buttons do exactly that. each setting of the white balance you have set can then be saved to a text file and then loaded again.</seg>
<seg id="405">The Preferences button sets all filter values back to their default values and the neutral white balance. note that neutral settings will result in a different picture than your original. if you save it, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can set the encoding depth for each color channel of the edited image. 8-bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit encoding is better suited for high-quality images. however, this encoding also requires more disk space, calculation time and is only available for formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as the processing of shell images. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. color mapping can be done by the subwindow for the brightness. a detailed instruction for using color profiles allows you to consult the chapter color management.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is to find sound correction in the menu. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously, allowing you to always make the same mistake and therefore always need the same correction. in the manual for sound correction you will find more information.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you can find under colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digitized; tool color effects provide you with four color effects, a solar effect effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a edge filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, Solarisation was also called Sabatier, an effect that arose when one partially developed a short flash light and then completed the development of the picture. the colored, darker areas protected the sensitive photographic paper from the additional light. this had the effect that the lighter ranges darker and the colors were inverted by the second lighting. the result was a partial negativity of the image. this tool allows you to fine-adjust this interesting effect.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity checks the polarization. at approx. 50% intensity, the picture shows what is chemically possible. another upliftment finally creates a negative image that is not to be produced on photographic paper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar installation effect. the original image is the (1) and that processes the (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from a saturation by making a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. just try it, it embellishes many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for an inverse colour film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. Velvia offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts. the characteristics make it a film of choice for nature photographers. Velvia offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts. however, these characteristics make it a film of choice for nature photographers. Velvia's strong saturated colours, however, are too much.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neon filter simulates neon light on the contrasting edges. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repetitions the strength of the neon light. for large images, the filter can overload the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and luminosity of the photos. you can try to experiment the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors. once you are satisfied with the result, use the Ok button and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you make a photo in poor light conditions, you can get the opposite problem: a too big saturation. also in this case the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation rather than increase it. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool gradation and the simple luminous intensity / contrast / gamma, the tool tonem correction is located to improve the exposure. even if the dialog to this tool works very complicated, you only need the range of sliders for the application described here. more concrete the three sliders below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of the intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area. under the graph three sliders are clicked into which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn how to use it is to shift the controller and make sure the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right side, the original and preview of the image can be viewed. the preview will be updated dynamically based on the settings of the image. on the left hand side, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: this selection box shows whether the histogram is displayed with a linear or logarithmic Y axis. for images of a digital camera, the linear histogram is often dominated by a single pillar. in this case, the logarithmic division is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three regulators: the upper for the dark sounds, the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle sounds, often called gamma-values.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color pinholes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadows, medium and light sounds. in addition, there is a button for fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controllers that can be used to interactively change the output values as with input values. for example, the compression of the output values can be used to create a fading image as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button, the image values are automatically set in dependence on the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and load: with these buttons, the set values can be stored in the file system and loaded again later. to do so, the Gimp Levels format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three color pipette, the input values will be automatically adjusted for all shadows, medium and sunshades. activate the color pipette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the histogram for red, green, blue and luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The option over exposure indicator monitors all color channels to find overexposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you only get the effect displayed in the preview and there is no effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below is an example of the adjustment of input values applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected image with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">The left side shows half of the original and the target image. the preview will be updated dynamically depending on your settings. on the right-hand side, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modified channel: this box allows the channel to be specified which is modified by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">Next to this box there are two symbols to switch between a linear and logarithmic view. for pictures taken with a digital camera, linear mode is mostly the most useful. for images with large areas of a constant color, linear mode generates a wide beam. in this case logarithmic mode helps.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a curve to the right, e.g. the bright tones, then you can see that these bright tones correspond to darker output tones and that the corresponding image pixels are darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">Preview the original photos is a red marker to see. if you move this marker to the area you want to change, a matching line is displayed on the curve representing the original value. create a point on this line and move it then up and down until the value is adjusted according to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and load: with these buttons you can do exactly this. every curve you created can be stored in the file system and loaded later. the file format for this is the Gimp curve format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you create this method and the three color pipettes automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow, middle and sun shades. activate the color pipette you want to use and click the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The option over exposure indicator monitors all color channels to display overexposed pixels. if you are found in more than one channel overexposed pixels, you get the combined result. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black-and-white photo that has been corrected in the luminance channel. shadow and sun shades were set with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original image is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The & Edit channel mixer; image editing is a tool to enhance color channels or change the color shade of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The Channel Mixer is another sophisticated tool to mix the color tones of the images. you can edit it from the menu color channel mixer of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selection box, you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first indication how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash. the left pane of the window will show you a preview. the original can be viewed for comparison with your own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position it in the image, a vertical line appears in histogram to show you the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are below: controls for red, green and construction allow you to mix these channels. if you enable luminance, the image will retain the overall brightness, as the channel mixer is THE tool to generate great black-and-white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black-and-white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when mixing monochrome, the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the color. if that's the case, you can improve your monochrome conversion by reducing your monochrome conversion first.</seg>
<seg id="447">The Save as and Load Buttons are used for this purpose. any mixer setting can be saved for later and then load. the used file format is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The option over exposure indicator monitors all color channels to find overexposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you only get the effect displayed in the preview and there is no effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a picture in which the blue channel has been readjusted. the option Luminance Store is enabled. the original image is under (1) and the edited image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography was always fascinating because of your ability to abstraction. in the development of digital photography, black / white is a work step, because color images can easily be converted on the computer. also with a set of film roll profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford PF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter. this looks great, with all scene pictures and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky. so similar to the 004 Cokin (tm) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and air photos. so similar to the 002 Cokin (tm) orange filter.</seg>
<seg id="454">Red filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic celestial effects and can simulate moonlight scenes at daytime. similarly, like the 003 Cokin (tm) red filter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 Cokin (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">SEpiaton: creates warm and medium sounds while adding a bit coldness in the cockatons. this is very similar to the process of the emergence of a pressure and the redevelopment in a serum pad. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and therefore similar to the 005 Cokin (tm) seepiphilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">With & Edit; applying tool texture can apply decorative textures to an image.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, regardless of whether it is a color image or not, you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas, the stitch of an old master, a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a wall picture on a wall.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: shift this parameter to the right increases the impression of the depth or three-dimensionality of the texture on the image.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper text effect has been applied on the photo below. the original image is (1) and the changed under (2) to see. the relief index has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With & Edit; Add tool frame can be added a decorative frame around a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task. one way to keep his attention is to put the picture a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier for the scattering eye. under Image frames, the module can be started from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter set the desired frame type for your image. going through the picture with a colored line, Niepce bordered it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black and white pictures), bevelled it with a nice three dimensional frame. ideal for a button effect and decorative adds a decorative frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: specifies the width of the frame in percentage. the range of values for the width is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">The target image decorated with the frame will be larger than the original, but have the same aspect ratio. this is important for printing the images, especially if you have used the tool according to aspect ratio previously.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this handy tool, you can easily insert a formatted text into an image at any location. this also goes to several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply enter the text and place it with the mouse. use text orientation, orientation, color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need. you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Each setting you selected for your text can be changed until you press the button "OK." once the image has been saved, the text is part of the image. it can no longer be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">With & Edit; applying tool template can place a template over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The Image Processing menu apply in image processing can be used to lay templates over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template, there are no limitations regarding size and orientation. however, you need to take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression (9) to reduce the file size of the template. if you want to add your template to & digitized; mailinglist digicam-users @ kde.org..</seg>
<seg id="472">If you are using this tool for the first time, you need to set your stencil folder with the Base Folder button in the dialog. select the folder where you copied the template files. these settings will be noted for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder has been set for the templates, a tree view appears that reflects the folder structure of the stencil. selecting a folder will automatically update the template of the templates.</seg>
<seg id="474">Under the preview you will find three buttons with which you can change the magnification factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge This button enlarges the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Shrink: this button shrinks the underlying image. it is centered around the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template to the whole image, you need to shrink the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move the image below the template. take the image and place it at the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK when you want to apply the template to your image. the image will then be automatically adjusted to the preview size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digitized; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very quick and easy to create, but especially in dark areas, grainy images.</seg>
<seg id="481">Blurring mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture sharper. in fact, it sharpens no bit; it works rather psychovisual. you can use it to remove atmospheric vapor and it does here a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is protected by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocusing might be the best of the three since it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters to adjust.</seg>
<seg id="483">Images without focus as well as most digitized images need a correction of sharpness. elements that are smaller than the resolution are combined into a common colour. the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras normally require more subsequently sharpening than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">In JPEG images, an internal sharpening camera is often used. images in the raw format, on the other hand, must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners use a sharpness filter while reading the image. if you disable it, you get control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations, you can get useful results by sharpening a photo with sharpening tool suit. you can call up sharpening with the menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="487">However, the sharpness increases the sharpness of the edges, but also increases the noise. in general, the most useful technique to sharpen one image increases the tool. in general, the most useful technique to sharpen an image will refocus the tool. you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques to focus.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crisp. the solution to draw the picture slightly softly is much easier than sharpening. use the tool to soften the image with the menu entry Correcting softness and experiment with some settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog will show you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter Unless masking is a very good tool to remove sliders from your photos. you can see a demonstration here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help to edit the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often produce good results and should be tested first. if you make the blurring mask too strong, noise and the impression of burrs will produce close to sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius adjusts how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii. therefore, you should sharpen images best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the wiped image added to the original. thus, the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the difference amount to be applied. this allows for a minimum difference to be applied to an edge of the filter. thus, areas with a soft transition between the tones are excluded and therefore beauty errors in faces, skies and water surfaces are avoided.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the blurred filter. the original image is the (1) and the painted image the (2). blurred masking was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">This & digicam; tool refocus refocus a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyrighted degreaser algorithm of Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries a picture to & quot; refocerenquot; in which it reverses the defocus. this is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Viennese filtration. the traditional technique for sharpening images is the use of a blurring mask. refocusing usually reaches better results than blurred. you can launch it from the menu by re-focus colors in image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular folding works much better than the Gauß's folding. the Gauß'sche Faltung has a very long tail, which results in the mathematical result also influenced by the swelling pixelates, which are far from the original source pixel. in most cases, the FIR Viennese inverse of the Gauß's Faltung is strongly influenced by the distant pixels. this causes undesired results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular acuteness: this is the radius of circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most images, the default value should result 1 good results. you can set a higher value if your image is very blurred, but pay attention to halons.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation may help to reduce artefacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. useful values are 0.5 and values near 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation decreases the sharper effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filter: an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce artifacts. the filter can accept values from 0-1. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, & eg; 0 the image quality is very poor. a useful value is 0,03. a high value will further blurb the image.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauss' sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauß 'sharpness. use this parameter if your blurred gauze is. this is most often caused by a previously executed blurring filter. in most cases, you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying artefacts. if you use a value unequal to zero, you may need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Die size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase of the die size can produce good results, especially if you select large values for the circular edge or the Gauss' sharpness. in most cases, you should select a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The Save as and Load Buttons are used for this purpose. any refocused parameter that you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to perform all blanks, color and intensity corrections on the image before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible, but later leave unpleasant artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">When you read and compress images, & eg; than JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">In general, Unintensely masking produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by blurring masking a larger neighborhood than sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">In theory, unintensely masking must always produce artefacts. even under optimal conditions it is never possible to remove the effect of blurring. for the Vienna filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal lens filter. practically the result of the FIR Wiener Filter is always at least as good as the blurring mask. the FIR Wiener Filter is often better in the processing of small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters, applied on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp color image must be corrected. this image has been made with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the correction methods in digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English at this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The slider smoothes the blurring of the area that was darkened in order to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">The ink ink allows a customized color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones, then you can set this here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The image error correction tool is one of the most developed tools to remove unwanted artifacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The painting was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS Labin in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains different default settings as starting points to simplify the restoration process. the available default settings are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to fine-tune filter settings, you can use the smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail level p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details. a small value leads to uniform smoothing over the picture. whereas larger values are mainly smoothing and details are sharp. a value of 0.9 should keep details in such a way that no sharpening is necessary afterwards. please note that the attention should always be subordinate to direction dependency.</seg>
<seg id="520">Directional dependence alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions while a value is smoothed close to 1 only in one direction. if you have a film granularity or CCD Partition will produce a high value wave-like pattern. JPEG artefacts are best removed at a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Flatten [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore set this value to the degree of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more is smoothed. this is necessary if there is a lot of noise, as it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: indicates how often the algorithm is going through. normally, 1 or 2 is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle alignment [5, 90]: angle dependant integration of anisotropic alpha. if alpha is selected small, it should also be selected small. make sure that small angles generate a long run time. thus, you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral stride length [0,1, 10]: integrated stride width in pixels. you should set the value of smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never exceed 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear Interpolation: the more quality you get by choosing this option is minimal. however, it doubles the duration. we therefore recommend it to release it.</seg>
<seg id="527">The Save as and Loading buttons do exactly that. any setting of image errors can be saved into a text file and later recharged.</seg>
<seg id="528">Correcting image errors is comparatively very fast at work. however, it may take a long time to load a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation using the Cancel button at any time.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how image errors are corrected with Small Artefacts. the module is used on a photo that was taken in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you see, there is a peculiar black artwork in the background that caused by a poor film deposit during the trip. the original image is below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">& digicam; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artefacts such as dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Moireacute; -effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grained noise which can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases you only need the subwindow details and the subwindow Advanced Settings can remain with default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. large values increase the time the filter per pixel needs and can wipe the image. the area indicated by the radius moves over the image and the color in it is smoothed and therefore smaller errors corrected.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpness level. this value sets the pixel pitch the filter forwards to determine luminance changes. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter can no longer receive image details and noise or lubricate occurs again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls edge precision for sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong you can't remove all the noise or noise peaks can occur. set it to a value close to maximum if you want to remove a weak hiss or JPEG artifacts without losing any details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend changing either color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not influence the smoothness process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend changing either color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothness process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gamma tolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas, which are typically more raucous. however, it also alerts the shadow areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: controls the adjustment of the phase shock absorption. this value defines how quickly the adaptive filter radius responds to variations of luminance. if it is lifted, the edges appear smoother when it is too high. if it is at its minimum, noise and phase jitter may appear on the edges. it can remove noise peaks and is the recommended method for it.</seg>
<seg id="542">Store under and Load: these buttons are used exactly for this. all noise reduction parameters that you have set can be stored in the file system and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2). noise reduction was applied with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crisp for your purpose. fortunately, the solution to draw the picture slightly softly is fortunately much easier than sharpening a picture. use the tool to soften the plasticize using the menu entry Correcting softness and experiment with the smoothness. the preview window on the right side of the dialog displays the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">& digitized; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This restoration filter gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artifacts from your pictures. it is very well adapted to remove Gauß's noise, film baskets, scratches, compression artifacts and local errors that occur in digital, original or subsequently digitalized pictures. the smoothing takes place along the image contours and thereby gets the content as it also makes the human eye.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for color and texture replacement. texture replacement is performed with another tool, the image error correction. the algorithm for restoration has been developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS Labors in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG artefacts reduce: compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far from it. as a lossy compression algorithm, it produces some compression & quot; Artefaktequot; - small standards that can be seen in the uncompressed image. this setting should correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The Save as and Loading buttons do exactly that. each setting of photo restoration can be stored in a text file and later recharged.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a very long time and a high CPU load can be dragged. so you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Bee.</seg>
<seg id="551">The module is applied to a black and white photo that has been recorded with a Minolta (tm) 700Si camera to an Ilford (tm) HP-5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious movie grain on the faces. the original image is below (1) and the corrected under (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time, textures were applied to an old color photo that was scanned with a scanner. you can see the scan artefacts caused by the scanner illumination and the photo paper. the original image is below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digitized; tool Hotpixel makes it possible to remove any image pixels of photos using a CCD camera according to eight. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project protected by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead or hot pixels are a problem especially in high-quality raw mode photos since many cameras with JPEG compression have a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixels quot; and "quot; bright pixel quot; on a photo with a dark image subtraction method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Load this file into the wizard with the dark image button. the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera it is important that you take the dark image directly to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should download the appropriate dark image to the image to be corrected. an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels. note that the wizard will notice the last dark image and load it automatically in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and the preview will help you correct the result within the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with current settings. bad pixels are raised in all preview areas.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to preview the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. then select the best filter method to interpolate these pixel blocks. these are the filters available:</seg>
<seg id="561">Average: an average of the neighboring pixels is determined. the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block. for a one-dimensional interpolation, this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to compute a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim) which is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Kubisch: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to compute a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic bends (1-dim) which is then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel correction on a color photo taken from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure. the original image was enlarged to 300% (1) and the corrected image is below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">& digicam; correction correction is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e. underexposed corners, of an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lenses, especially those in medium and large photo format, can often not uniformly illuminate the entire sensor range. instead & quot; vignettier- quot; (shaded) it reduces the edges and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there. telephoto lenses may also show this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">Many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter, which increases the necessary shutter speed in such a way that it is impossible to use the camera with the hand. wide angle lenses should also be used with center filters, an aperture of f / 16 or smaller, as otherwise unsharpening effects are caused by movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large exposure zones of today's felt and grayscale depth of digital cameras and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter by applying an equivalent transformation on a rough image made without this filter. the tool Vignettierungsgrading applies the transformation with a center filter to an image. the algorithm is protected by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three regulators you can control the vignetting correction filter and with three further exposure of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light intensity at the point of the largest density the filter. the standard density is 2.0, which is compensated by an optical filter with an aperture setting of 1, or randomly a light intensity of 2, or by chance to compensate for a greater degree of vignetting, reduce it by a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Luminous intensity, contrast and gamma settings: editing an image with the vignetting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels. you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options. the controls only provide positive values, since you only have to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a finer readjustment of the exposure of the target image, let the values for brightness / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation from the & digicam; image editing from the Color Gradation menu.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of vignetting correction applied to an image. the original image (1) shows the correction in the corners and (2) the corrected image. a denial and contrast correction was also performed in the image with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digicam; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. color distortions cannot be corrected using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second degree treats the general geometrical distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar rounded effect, flatter but flattens on the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient fourth degree corrects the removed corners to that of the second degree. if you combine these two, any geometric distortion can be almost eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">General: this value controls the strength of distortion second degree. with negative values, tonical distortions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the thickness of the distortion fourth. this value works more strongly at the edges than in the middle of the picture. for most lenses the 'Corner Parameters' has the reverse sign of the parameter.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value scaled the image size and results in a correction of first degree. negative values increase while positive image resize.</seg>
<seg id="583">Light: this value adjusts the brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase it.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialog with a preview illustrates the distortion correction. the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values next time.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tonneny- or cushion-shaped correction should be performed before all cutting or resizing changes. best perform this correction as the first one. if you cut a picture again and then perform a tonical correction, the effect is apparently the wrong.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction, this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal guide line. move the mouse cursor in the image preview to display the dotted lines. move it to an important place, such as the sea edge or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. subsequently, you can correct the tonnen- / cushion distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a verting distortion the resulting image will have black corners. you can remove them using the cutting tool in the transformation menu Remove from image editing or via the zoom slider of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">The next logical step for some motifs such as shots from the front, frame and paintings is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the image have 90 degrees. note that when you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the tonical correction applied to a church in Norway. the original image is below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method to simulate the infra-red tape of the GimpGuru and org web site which is accessible below this URL. the filter reproduces the known Ilford (tm) SFX200 Iinfrarotape, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the image.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can set two parameters of film granularity and film sensitivity (ISO). add the option Add film granularity when you want to simulate the granular texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO controller alters the amount of film granularity and the dominance of the color green (chlorophyll in nature) in transformation. green meadows are white as snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">As the filter mixes color channels for reproducing infrared film, especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the color information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photograph from New Zealand. the original image is below (1) and the edited image below (2). the sensitivity of the film has been set to ISO 400. higher ISO values create a kind of aura in the advanced.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digicam; filter film granularity is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce film grains on your pictures. this is known from classical high-speed films such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the films, manufacturers mix large silver grains of photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film gradient effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back into the past. the treated image gets rid of a timeless ambiance detached from everyday life. if you want this special, gallery-like, road photograph, granular sight especially in your monochrome photos, you must use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the controller, the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although frequently higher values are needed, set to ISO-2400. if you need even more grains, you can apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film gradient effect applied to a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and this worked the (2). the used film sensitivity conform to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digicam; filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digitized; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting. nature pictures and still life are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two controls to influence this effect. the upper one selects the brush size between one and five. thicker brushes are better suited for large images. flatten the smoothing or, viewed from the other side, the charms.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of oil painting effect. the original image is marked with (1) and the computation is marked with (2). brush size for this 640 pixels large image is 1 and smoothing 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digitized; filter charcoal drawing uses color and intensity gradients to create a cabbage-sketch. images whose gradients are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine which scene you would have chosen to outline yourself. these would be good pictures to start with.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controllers with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper knob selects the pen size and the lower adjusts the contrast (smoothness).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the carbon capture filter. the original image (1) and the changed image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & Edit filter engravings your image in 3-D as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digitized; Filter Graph is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3-D effect. it works especially well with pictures with a simple structure where color is not the most important of the content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray, monstrous landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows adjusting the contrast of filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the processed image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of distortion effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Shaft Part 1: divides the image into cells and lets it look as if it is viewed through blocks of glass.</seg>
<seg id="612">Shaft 2: analog to the shaft blocks 1 the image is distorted with another version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time using the button Bee.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of blurring effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Out: blurring the image along star-shaped lines that emanate from a center. this simulates blurring a zooming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of often seen in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial blurring: blurring the image by turning the pixels around a center. this simulates the blurring of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance blurring: blurred the image to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object seems to step back into the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Blurring: blurred the image through horizontal movements of the pixels. this simulates the blurring of a moving linear moving, z: B: from a car or by train, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Blurring blurring: blurred the image smoothly into the dark and strongly in the bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and brilliant soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or adding a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Sharpness: blurring the image by chance shift of the pixels and simulates the blurring of an arbitrary moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent blurring: finds the color pool in the picture and wipes it without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: divides the photo into rectangular cells and then recreates it by filling with an average pixel value.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. you can cancel this calculation at any time with the button Beaching.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool to make raindrops on your image. this gives natural your pictures a wet look. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn copyrighted algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows to change the size of drops. since the droplet size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images. number changes the number and density of drops. fish eyes change the optical effect of drops on the image.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can choose with & Edit; image processing a range free of raindrops. use the selection tool to select the area, e.g. a face that should remain free. if you then start the filter raindrops the range will remain free of raindrops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the raindrop filter. the original image (1) shows a calm sunset and the processed image (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can get it by mirroring or turning it into the correct orientation. the tools for this can be found in the Transformation Turning or Shift mirroring.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo inflating is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">The big question is, how can you inflate a picture and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom in an image when the limits of the resolution are reached? how can you retrieve or guess the missing information? the CImg algorithm used here makes a good job here. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size, you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. select transformation size change in the menu and enter the target values. the dialog is shown below.</seg>
<seg id="632">Change the tool to size uses a linear interpolation method to approximate the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality then try the tool to inflate.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image processing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. spline interpolation to enlarge a picture. & digikam; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo inflated was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You have to tell the tool how to change the size. these settings are available in the New Size tab and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Keep aspect ratio: if this setting is enabled, the aspect ratio of the original image is maintained when entering the new size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more is smoothed. this is necessary if there is a lot of noise, as it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The Save as and Loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose. enlarge Any setting for photo can be saved as a text file and later recharged.</seg>
<seg id="638">Inflating photo is very fast with what it does, but it can take a long time and a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Bee.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example of photo inflating by enlarging a small paint image to the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged image (3). the preview (2) is the result of the linear magnification for comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">The cutting of a photo is not only a frequently performed surgery, but also a frequently underestimated tool to put a picture together. to cut a photo you need to create with the mouse just the rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and drawing the rectangle. you will see this rectangle as you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">When you release the mouse button again the area of the photo will be cut out. this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting. you can change the size of the area to be cut by dragging it at the corners of the rectangle. a new rectangle can be created by simply dragging it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cut, use the button The Ctrl + + X button in the toolbar and the photo is cut (Ctrl + + X). use the file Save or File Save as in the File menu to save the newly cropped photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the preview window, you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio you have defined in the dialog remains intact.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool according to aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as high-format or landscape format. in portrait aspect, the greater value of the height and in the cross-format of the width is assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool according to aspect ratio makes use of a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimeters, inches or any other physical size. you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog, there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">At the bottom of the dialog you can set the range to the maximum possible depending on the selected ratio and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool according to aspect ratio will store its settings depending on the image orientation (Horizontal or Vertical). if you use the cutting tool the next time, these settings are displayed in the EXIF tables, so that the EXIF data reflect the cropped image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the interconnection help make it possible to hide help in order to better compose your images. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonious triangles are based on the principle of similarity. like the third-elbows, harmonious triangles are a possibility to divide a rectangle in similar harmonious triangles on the diagonals.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden middle: the golden middle is a division that refers to various natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the leaves of a sunflower. it appears in all sorts of things that we perceive as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden division is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks, which thus constructed your temples and pyramids. artists and architects used the golden division in all times when you put your pictures, buildings and even photos together to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is derived from Fibonacci Episode 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc. the resulting divider is 1: 1.618 the golden center. a composition that follows this rule is considered visually harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The gold center provides more liquid relief lines if you put together a picture. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden spiral will bring you good results for your photos. compared to the third gel, the golden spiral generates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image. this kind of composition leads the gaze of the beholder along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetric visual flow on this way.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. these rectangles are used to create the golden spiral. this can be a line or different objects. this can simply be there without guiding the eye, it will fulfill its task.</seg>
<seg id="657">The Golden Triangles also derive from the golden spiral mentioned above. their vertices are the central points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that in contrast to harmonious triangles, golden triangles are not equal triangles. diagonal to these lines can be published a static object more dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">When using golden triangles to break your frame you create an effect called dynamic symmetry. try to place your focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition which you cannot reach otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="659">The horizontal mirrors and vertical mirrors can be used to mirror the harmonic divisions.</seg>
<seg id="660">The color of the lines allows you to set the color of the lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the lines can be invisible. this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The free rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">When you make a photo, it is easy to keep the camera horizontally or horizontally. this creates a picture in which things are rotated around an angle. this creates a picture in which things are rotated around an angle. you can do this with the & digicam; image editing and the tool free rotation repair. select transformation Free Rotation and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your picture with the slide angle. the values on this slider are given in degrees. with the Preferences button you can set the slide to 0 degree. a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image are shown on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line. move the mouse cursor in the image preview to position the two lines. after you have moved it over an important point of the image, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in the previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have shot a picture you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. one way to fix this is to use the function Transformers Cropping out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is the automatic cut function. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The anti-aliasing option smooths the image a bit after turning. but notice the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspective transformations are performed by a fixed point to the so-called reference point. this point is in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview will then be automatically recalculated. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: displays the width of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: displays the height of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle left: displays the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle right up: displays the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle at the bottom left: displays the current angle in degrees at the bottom left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle right down: displays the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective, the image becomes somewhat blurred. for a single adjustment, this effect is small, but two adjustments generate a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you have adjusted the perspective you get unpleasant triangular holes at the corners. one way to clean it is to cut the picture with transformers trimming out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The shearing tool is used to move part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction. for example, the upper part of the image is distorted to the right and the lower part to the left. this is no rotation, the image is distorted. in other words, a rectangle is transformed into a parallelogram. you can start this module via transformation scissors.</seg>
<seg id="679">Drag your picture by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle. if you press presets, the angles are reset to zero. a preview of the effect will be shown to you and the new dimensions of the target image are shown to the right of the preview area.</seg>
<seg id="680">To your help a vertical and a horizontal line are displayed. move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the control tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have done the scaling, the image is wiped a bit. for a single shearing, this effect is usually negligible, but two notes generate twice as much blurry and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After the scaling, the image has triangular holes in the corners. one way to remove them is to cut the picture with transformers trimming out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digitized; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries were compiled. in most distributions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & digicam.</seg>
<seg id="684">Because of this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to find a list of all file formats available on your system. however, you will always find JPEG and TIFF among them.</seg>

<seg id="727">& kalliviewer; is a KDE program for viewing & graphiviz; -dot; -Graphs. & Graphical; programs are free layout programs. & kalligraphviewer; displays graph with all possibilities of a well integrated & kde; program in a modern and user-friendly & GUI; an. it has the following functions:</seg>
<seg id="728">Integration in & kate; and & konqueror; (so that a change of graph in & kate; calculates the graph and in & kalliviewer;)</seg>
<seg id="729">Menu to open the graph in & kate; open or graph in & kalliviewer; open in a & kate; component</seg>
<seg id="730">Loading large graphs (currently there are problems starting from about 1000 knots and a hack to show more than these nodes)</seg>
<seg id="731">Further required software: & kalliviewer; is a & kde; -program that presupposes the & graphiviz; -Tool & dot; for the representation of graphs. needed in detail:</seg>
<seg id="732">The main window displays the opened graph, each in its own sub-window. initially, if you start & kalligraphs; without booting an argument, the main window is empty as in the lower screen shot. in this case, the toolbar only contains the icon File Open and the (empty) list last opened files. click on the first icon to open the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="733">After you have selected one or more & dot; files, the main window looks like in the bottom screenshot:</seg>
<seg id="734">As you can see, an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the drawing area. you can select a fixed position of this overview using the context menu or automatically select this position.</seg>
<seg id="735">Use the scroll wheel (up and down without special buttons, left and right with pressed & old; button);</seg>
<seg id="736">Zooming is limited in both directions by a factor 10. below you see the maximum reduction of a graph.</seg>
<seg id="737">If the file currently loaded into & kmviewer; loaded file was modified by another program, the following window will appear:</seg>
<seg id="738">You can choose whether the graph will be reloaded or whether you want to ignore the change. & kalliviewer; can also memorize your decision, so that later on. if you want to change your decision later, you can use the menu item Settings kGraphviewer; set up... use, see also.</seg>
<seg id="739">If you want to open a graph file outside of a running & cGraphiviewer; instance open, & eg; in the file browser or at the command line, you have the choice if you want to open a new & cGraphiviewer; instance, or display the graph to be loaded in a subwindow of the current instance.</seg>
<seg id="740">As with the last option, you can save your choice permanently, but change it with the setup dialog afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="741">At program start, you can open all graphs of your last session again. again, you can save your choice both as well as change later.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can also specify how to split the graph to several pages. the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be selected freely.</seg>
<seg id="743">When you use multiple pages, you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come to a page should be adjusted to this page. the aspect ratio is ignored. if you keep the aspect ratio, the pages may not be filled by the respective parts of the graph.</seg>
<seg id="744">Page preview with one on several pages without header and with another font</seg>
<seg id="745">The Erneut Load site gives the ability to specify behavior when a file has been modified on the hard disk, & eg; from another program. you can set a default behavior (automatically reload or ignore the changes) or let the program ask for each time.</seg>

<seg id="751">The & neato; algorithm is the standard for unexecuted graphs. it produces representations according to the springspring model. the Kamada Kawai algorithm is used, which is equivalent to statistical multi-dimensional scaling.</seg>
<seg id="752">The & FDP; algorithm creates a springspring model layout for unexecuted graphs. it uses the Fruity-man-pure gold heuristics, and includes a multi-grid solver for the treatment of large and clustered graphs.</seg>
<seg id="753">The & Circo; algorithm arranges the nodes circular according to the description of Six und Tollis, 1999, and Kauffman and Wiese, 2002. it is useful for certain graphs of multiple cyclic structures.</seg>
<seg id="754">Open a dialog where you can specify a layout command that is then executed by a shell. the command should accept the graphene file as a parameter, and output the calculated layout of the graph.to stdout in xdot format. with such a layout command you can set & eg; den & graphiviz; -algorithms special options, or also change the graph with a filter before it is drawn.</seg>

<seg id="810">The KIPI module for geographical localization provides tools to locate pictures geographically in the spherical coordinate system used by GPS and Galileo. height, length and width are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your pictures with geographic data you need a GPS trace as XML file in the gpx format. gpsbabel and gpsman can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Image Geographical localization Correlation. this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS trace.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images you want to correlate in the main window and go to the menu. the above-looking dialog will then load. to get a possible correlation between time and localization, you need to load a track file with GPX file. of course, this file contains data that were recorded at the same places at the same time as the images of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">When the file is loaded an automatic correlation is performed which indicates the coordinates in red. GPS trace data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera's time must be converted to GMT. this can be done using the time zone. set your camera line here.</seg>
<seg id="815">The setting for the maximum time deviation indicates the upper deviation for the GPS time and camera. if the deviation is included, the data is merged. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you don't have track data from one place for pictures you can edit the gpx file manually and add to the images. the time difference of 2000 seconds will correlate all images in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolate and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have the right data. if you know that in reality there is a location in a great time difference between camera and GPS, you can set these limits here and then press the button correlate to interpolate.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set manually with this dialog. this is useful if you have made a number of photos at the same location. as the dialog opens the coordinates from a call to the next, you just need to use the OK button to set the data on the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found and set with the shown map. select the respective region and enlarge it. always select it again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy. the map can always be selected manually. the map can be changed between map mode, satellite image and a mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module, there are possibilities to attach the GPS data to the images. here is a small script used to provide a stack of images with GPS data.</seg>

<seg id="822">This module can export your albums to a picture gallery from HTML pages conforming to version 4.01. you can select the albums that are to be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages. the character set is encoded UTF-8 to make the best possible internationalization possible.</seg>
<seg id="823">The tab has four tabs in which the settings can be adjusted. the tab selection allows you to select all the albums that are to be exported to HTML. you only need to select the albums on the right. in the area below you can quickly select a large number of albums. in the area below you will see the album preview and the text that appears in the header of the HTML page.</seg>
<seg id="824">The tab design defines the general appearance and layout for each page. this tab is largely self-explanatory. if you then click on a picture, a new page opens in which the image is displayed. otherwise, the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer, & eg; Dickshow</seg>
<seg id="825">The tab album defines the settings where and how the gallery is to be saved with all your associated images. select a folder on which you have write permission. a subfolder named KIPIHTMLExport which contains everything will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG File Format, the EXIF information of your original images will also be saved in the new images.</seg>
<seg id="827">With Other color depth you can change the default color depth. of course, this also influences the file size. all other settings are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="828">The thumbnail images allow you to adjust some of the settings from the album tab for the thumbnails, these are small images that are shown in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window shows the user how far the action is. press Cancel to cancel the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">When the module has created the pages, the window will not be automatically closed. you can therefore read the program messages to see if errors occur during creation. the web browser will automatically start at the end to preview the gallery. press Close to close the module.</seg>

<seg id="844">All images are automatically scaled to the correct size for the selected video format. additionally, you can select a background color for the slideshow. with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD Player. to burn the medium you can finally use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">First you have to select the images to be packed into the MPEG slide show. after that, you can create the module on Tools MPEG Diashau.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images you have selected are then listed under image files in the Portfolio. there you can also change the sorting of the images or the contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are happy with your list, you should adjust the other settings. the video format can be selected from various formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you are planning to play the file on a TV, you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is preset and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step, you should specify the time in seconds you indicate an image. the speed of the image transition is defined below. a low value creates very sudden, but a high, very smooth image change.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in case of doubt, you should let it black. in case of doubt, you can specify the name and path of the generated file under the name of the MPEG output file.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file, it will be integrated into the movie. after you have adjusted all settings to your preferences, you can use the button code to start generating the movie. depending on the speed of your computer, you can quickly or in all rest enjoy a cup of coffee and enjoy the slideshow when you are back.</seg>
<seg id="851">If an indicator appears that encoders or tools are missing, you can adjust the paths to the programs of the Mjpegtools and ImageMagick packages via the button settings to the right bottom.</seg>
<seg id="852">The Print Assist allows you to print several images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes. the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gimp. for example, this is useful for you to improve or print directly with the Gimp module.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format to one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command line tool dcraw of Dave Coffin. an original quote from Him is: do not expect from dcraw that it produces the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer. sometimes you get with dcraw better results!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the RAW file to be converted and start the module. the Raw image converter window appears in the mode for a single image. with the button Preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the image.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option determines whether the camera settings should be used for white balance. the main parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can further edit the image later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-color RGBG conversion can be selected so you can use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch does not have any effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are satisfied with the preview, you can select one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. the filename stays the same and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossless algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">The Tagged Image Format, TIFF, retains all information of your image and uses lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you plan to edit your images often or otherwise use it elsewhere you should not select the JPEG format as it only allows a limited number of operations before image quality deteriorates. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you select JPEG as a storage format, the metadata that is contained in the RAW file will be stored in the JPEG file in the Exif information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adjusted your settings, you can start the conversion with the Execute button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="863">Batch editing mode allows you to convert several images at one time. use this mode if you are sure, e.g. by testing on a single image, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for single images. however, they have the possibility to overwrite existing files. this is useful if they were created in an earlier attempt. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar shows how far the conversion has progressed.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all images in one album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all pictures of an album. you can set the prefix, the start number and the timestamp of the album.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of multiple images from an image collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can zoom or enlarge the image. to do so, four types of image change are provided:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in one dimension. width or height of the image is selected automatically, depending on image orientation. the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): resizing in two dimensions. the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option for example to customize your image to the screen format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Non proportional: not proportional size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed with this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Prepress: prepares the image for the photo printing. the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the photo paper. the target image, including background size, edge size and background color, will be adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected images with your preferred e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before. further images can be dragged onto the list of images to be sent and stored there.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you have started the module, the image window will display the images you have selected. you can add more images using a file selection dialog. for the last selected image, a preview will be displayed on the right.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag and drop images to the image list to add the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="875">With the button Remove images, the selected images are removed from the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="876">After you have selected all the images, you can use the OK button to open the new message window of your e-mail client. you just have to add the addresses and the subject. the images you have selected are attached as attachments.</seg>
<seg id="877">Most e-mail accounts have limitations on the size of e-mails sent. it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The E-Mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images. your configuration is saved and used every time you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your email client from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you will need to specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you are using the Google Mail service, you must first install the Gmail Agent on your computer. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After selecting comments in an attached file, the comments are added to the images in a text file and attached to the mail.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format below the File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted to lossless formats such as TIFF. you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise, we recommend you to format JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG in file format and the original files are in JPEG format, then the original Exifdates will be added to the images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is finished, the window will not be closed automatically so you can view the status messages, on the search for errors. however, your e-mail program will automatically start at the end. by closing the button you can lock this window.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the module Advanced Slideshow, a window will appear with questions like you want to show your slideshow. you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">Using OpenGL passes in the presentation activates very elegant image transitions by means of OpenGL. however, you must have a corresponding graphic card, as otherwise the slideshow will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The File View option ensures that the filename of the images is displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The Loop option allows the presentation to be displayed in a loop. you can then manually interrupt it with Esc.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option to select pictures randomly ensures that the images are displayed in a random order. thus, the order of the images is not used in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">The temporal distance between the images can be set between the images. 1500 milliseconds corresponds to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value. so, the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transition effect. so you should test this before you show your friends' presentation!</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose. randomly, each transition between the images selects a different effect.</seg>
<seg id="892">During slideshow you can access a toolbar at the top left edge of the screen. move the mouse into this corner to turn on.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this toolbar you can pause and restart the presentation, jump to the previous and next image and stop the slide show.</seg>
<seg id="894">At the bottom of the screen you can see the current filename, position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module time & date currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. attention: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module background image is a tool to set a picture as a background image for the work surface.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module sets the currently selected image, depending on the selected submenu option, as background for your KDE work surface.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have provided your pictures and videos with annotations, you can use & kphotoalbum; browse through these browsers, see picture. as you can see through a comparison with the image, there are now entries in each group, i.e. in persons, places and in the group keywords.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window you will see the categories for which you have entered information as you have provided your pictures and videos with annotations. additionally there are entries to look for EXIF-based information, view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course view the current thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="900">When you press the mouse on the entry, the view of the browser changes. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you select another person only the images displayed on which both persons can be seen. by this selection method you can restrict the number of images displayed by a few thousand images to a few individual images.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all persons, places and other settings, you can display thumbnails to view the images of your sphere of activity.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture each person has the same symbol in front of her name. you can save with & kphotoalbum; however, for each person to store their own thumbnail, that is of course also valid for places, keywords and other categories you have defined yourself. see also the picture.</seg>
<seg id="904">To view images next to the names, select the button located on the right outside of the toolbar. in the appearing context menu, you can select which view you want to use for each category. this has the advantage that you can display icons with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords (if you don't have any suitable images for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">However, you have to define yourself which image should be displayed for each individual person. to do this, you need to open the image view window (described in more detail) and select the image for the corresponding person in the context menu. in the View window, you can customize the image for the corresponding person. in the View window, you can adjust the magnification factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image should be displayed or cut off.</seg>
<seg id="906">When you enter the search dialog in the main window, a dialog is displayed, which is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties. you can view this dialog at once.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a string in the labeling or description field, you can also enter a date to search for. if you want, you can also enter a date to search for; the date can be either a part of the total date, i.e. 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two dates, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the lower part of the window, you can browse all images by certain names as you can see in the picture. here is illustrated by images on which Jesper, but not Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user manual for & kphotoalbum;. if you do not like to read manuals, but rather want to try some features, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the homepage of & kphotoalbum; and check out the quick entry, the screenshots and the introduction videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & kscreen album; and in the first dialog, select the demo, if you want & kphotoalbum; start for the first time, or select the menu entry kphotoalbum; demo. then some sample images are loaded and you can use the functions of & kphotoalbum; try.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this manual, you will find it on the homepage of & kphotoalbum; as a contiguous HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & kphotoalbum; see the timeline. a picture of this bar can be seen here:. as the name suggests, this bar displays you date statistics about the images in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The timeline can show you several different time units. each bar then displays another unit. you can switch between the units years, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the bar only 10 minutes sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline can be used interactively in the following ways: you can change the displayed entries Preview view from the database (if you select a date, the first image of this date is displayed in the preview pane) and the timeline always displays the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in the preview pane.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select a section of the timeline by holding down the mouse button and dragging the mouse over the ruler of the timeline, so the time data. if you select a range, you will be shown in the preview view only images of this time period. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the timeline.</seg>
<seg id="917">& kphotoalbum; provides you two ways to create HTML websites with your pictures. one is integrated in & kphotoalbum; integrated and the other available as module (see). in the following part of the user manual, the integrated version is described which you can create through the File HTML menu...</seg>
<seg id="918">Before creating HTML pages you need to make some settings. these are divided into the three areas Content, Layout and Goal. in the following each area is described more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the title and a description which the HTML file should contain later. on kphotoalbum; HTML-example pages see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next select whether a & desktop album; export file is to be created which is to be seen on the overview page. next information about the export files can be found in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Finally, you can select which information to be displayed on the HTML pages. this allows you to avoid displaying information that is obvious to the viewer without any description. note that all images are displayed by a party. note that all images are exported from a party.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look like. most settings are unique, which is why this is not specifically dealt with.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page you can set up various resolutions for the images. thus, those who view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600 do not have images that have a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewers of your site can change the resolution at any time. so, it can browse your images with low resolution, which leads to a lower transmission time. if it wants to get a larger image, it changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this settings area, place the different folders and the URL where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">The best way to select a base folder for all your HTML files and create a new subfolder for each subsequent set.</seg>
<seg id="927">First you need to select the main folder where all your images will be saved. this folder will be saved and automatically added next time. this allows you to select either a folder or a KDE supported protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your images, you can check if they are really all visible to viewers. if you select a URL for the base folder, a web browser will be launched after the pages are created. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder, you will need to manually copy them to it. in order for the import function, see, correctly, you need to specify the final destination of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base folder where all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The settings you just described have moved all three to base folders and URLs. in this folder a subfolder will be created, whose name you specify in the output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are on a family party, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & kphotoalbum; coming together, you might want to share your pictures with them. however, if you have spent a lot of time using the image information, people on the pictures, recording location, etc., then you need to do with & kphotoalbum; do not do this work again.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kphotoalbum; you can export a copy of your images into a .kim file. these can import others into your database. the image properties are exported with ex- and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external ones. they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or if the file is only a shortcut to pictures. the advantage of storing all images in the file is that you have all the pictures together and that you can distribute this file so independently. however, the obvious disadvantage is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can either export a .kim file directly from the File menu... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file together with an HTML file, this will be an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file searches the images twice. first, it searches the images that are in the folder of the .kim file. if the corresponding images are not found, then the images of the URL you specified when creating the HTML files are scanned. this is of course only possible if you have created your .kim file using the HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">Below is a dialog for exporting images that you can click through the Export... menu.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .kim files. the following three options are available:</seg>
<seg id="938">With the manual copy option to the .kim file, you have to copy the images in the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the Automatically Copy to the .kim file copy & kscreen album; the images automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal Zip files. since most images have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small it is usually not worth compressing the files. if you want to do so, simply select the Export file option.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is to limit the size of the picture. if you send pictures to your friends, you might not want to send them in full size, because the .kim file would otherwise be very large. for example, you can limit the size by saying that each image should be maximum 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the File menu file... select, & kphotoalbum; import the exported database as described in described.</seg>
<seg id="943">The Import Assistant consists of four steps. first you need to select which images you want to import, then in which folder the import images should be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you specify the category persons of the file to be imported (if you are a domain), while this category stands in your database. therefore, in the third dialog box, you will be asked which categories of the file to be imported and what categories they are in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step you can compare the categories of the file to be imported using the categories of your current database. for example, see the image.</seg>
<seg id="946">It must be easy to browse and view images: if you look at pictures, you often want to jump within different picture groups & mdash; if you see for example pictures of your Italy vacation and discover a picture with your friend on it, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual, you will go through the various steps of (1) setting the information about your images, via (2) browsing and viewing, up to (3) advanced topics and customization options.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoAlbum has been started as a program for managing your images, but it has been expanded and today it also takes care of your videos. many places in this manual are talked about images, but frequently this includes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& kphotoalbum; stores all its information in the file index.xml in the top folder of your images. this is a simple XML file that you can use with a program of your choice, e.g. Normal backup tools, copy to a floppy or revisions in CVS where you want them.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kphotoalbum; remembers the folder where your images are stored and automatically restores it in future starts. if you want to read another database in & kphotoalbum, you can start another folder tree with pictures, you can start & kphotoalbum; with the -c option. as an example: kphotoalbum -c ~ / Company / Pictures / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Over the menu entry Settings kphotoalbum; set up... go to a window with which you can change the settings of & kphotoalbum; in the following section of the user manual you will explain the different settings.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you can see six different symbols that allow you to view the settings of the preview and the options for the viewer. for each setting, a detailed help is available, which you can access the F1 key by pressing a button and a click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It describes how you can define different properties for each image, e.g. persons, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">See the dialog which is used to edit existing groups. for each existing group, you can select a label and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section subcategories have already been mentioned. in the Options dialog you can set up complete members groups, i.e. all members of a group at once in a group, instead of all groups of a member as explained in.</seg>
<seg id="956">In the left half of the window you can select the category you want to configure. in the left half of the window there is a list of the current categories and in the right a list of subcategories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kscreen album; divides its modular system with other graphic applications, such as digiKam and Gwenview. this module system is called KIPI and means & kde; image plugin interface.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can and are not described in this manual as they are not part of & kphotoalbum; they are not part of & kphotoalbum; however, most modules have a help page that you can access through the modules themselves.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules are shared among each other by several applications, it may be that the modules were tested with & kphotoalbum; only very little have been tested. therefore, you should always test new modules with the demo database first before you apply it to your own images using the &gt; kphotoalbum -demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or using the Help menu. don't say I didn't warn you!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that the modules use together with KIPI are very different, whereby it may be that some modules with & kphotoalbum; do not work. this is the disadvantage if you share functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & kphotoalbum; and other applications that also use KIPI is that the other applications associate their images into albums: this is an album simply a folder. even if & kphotoalbum; this kind of order is not supported, it simulates order after albums for some modules to make use of the functions with & kphotoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="962">This simulates & kphotoalbum; the current album, which simply corresponds to the current view, so all the images that show you the picture preview at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="963">Next to the current album, & kphotoalbum, the modules also have to give a list of albums. here goes & kphotoalbum; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & kphotoalbum; s Browser shows the content of a category, for example all persons, then each entry in this category represents an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will use the category you specified in the Settings dialog as a category for virtual albums. so, for example, if you are using the category persons, the & kphotoalbum will do so, so whether you selected people to view and pass it on to the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & kphotoalbum are not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. to do so, start the settings dialog and select the modules to load modules.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start & kphotoalbum; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used to it from any other KDE application, see the top of a menu and toolbar. under the toolbar, you will see the window that you can browse your image database. in the section we will return to this window, but now click on the entry View images showing you an overview of all available images.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & kphotoalbum; is the possibility to provide any picture with annotations. this includes information about the people who are on the picture, where the image was taken, etc. you can use each image individually or for a larger number of pictures simultaneously. if, for example, on all pictures Jesper is pictured and all pictures taken in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these comments can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section. if you want, you can see those comments when using the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">You can see three lists with a text box by setting people, places and keywords. these are a very important part of & kphotoalbum; because you will always use them again when you enter information about your images.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is to defer the images within the list: for example, if you have a family celebration and are shown on all 50 pictures the same 5-10 people, you can, so that the names used are shifted upward, to find and assign the people faster.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to receive an alphabetically sorted list, click on the Sorting icon on date under the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected comments for each image individually, you may want to edit all the selected images and add annotations to them. in this case, simply click on the before and back buttons, which are located below the thumbnail of the image to the right.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have recorded several images, e.g. with the same person, it may be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item Several entries at once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA. San Francisco and Los Angeles are also located in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture you see a browser window that shows the USA as a subgroup. to show you that it is a subgroup, a special icon is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the comment dialog it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new subcategory. in addition, you can also simply drag an entry to a category and place it in order to make it an subcategory of this entry. attention, this requires you to sort your categories alphabetically.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the single items of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the bar which form the top edge of the frame. you can also make a separate window from a frame by dragging it outside the pane.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adjusted the appearance of the window to your needs so that you are satisfied with the settings, click on the Options... button to allow you, among other things, the possibility to save the current layout and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also completely hide a frame. if you want to get this window again later, use the Options button... and click / hide window here. see this process in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">When you select the entry View imagery in your browser, you will get an overview with thumbnails of the currently selected images, or all images if you do not have a filter. you can configure the size of thumbnails by simply dragging the mouse with the middle mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you drop a picture on the background of your desktop, this image will be set as a background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">If you click on a picture, it will appear in the picture viewer. if you don't have a window with an image viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete images in the image preview. simply select the appropriate images from which you want to delete and press either the Remove button or select Edit menu from the Edit menu. now, the window will be displayed, which you can see in the image.</seg>
<seg id="986">& kphotoalbum; provides you with a solution for this problem. you can use with & kphotoalbum; namely, images even without having stored on your hard drive. of course, you need to have the images stored somewhere so that & kphotoalbum; you can see the view from & kphotoalbum; if not all necessary images can be loaded from the hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="987">Images, where the right upper corner is cut off, are not stored on the hard disk. for example, see the images 1-9. for the pictures 5-9, however, the thumbnails are present, so that & kphotoalbum can show you the preview of these images. however, you can't view these images with the picture viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you see, this function requires you to copy files out of the folders and then copy it back. so if you want to avoid annoying, such as the messing of your images, please purchase a larger hard drive to save all images.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the menu images you will find a sub-menu with the name privacy. if you want a little more privacy, filter the images in such a way that at the end those who want to make you inaccessible to others and click on current view lock in the menu Privacy. alternatively, you can also choose all the images that your little sister is allowed to see, and choose the menu entry All except up-to-date view.</seg>
<seg id="990">This allows you to specify which images should be hidden in the case of your little sister. if you want to give the laptop to your little sister, simply select the menu entry to lock images, thus removing all the images you have locked. if you want to get the pictures again, click on lock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to set a password which must be entered to unlock the images. to set up this password, simply select Password in the Privacy menu.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please keep in mind that this image protection is by no means very secure. on the one hand, all the images on the hard drive and to the other, anyone who can access the file index.xml can read or delete the password as unencrypted text. this kind of password protection only serves to ward off the view to private pictures.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason you want to spend all your pictures with & kphotoalbum; manage and spend hours over hours with it is natural that you want to consider them sometime. for this reason, & kphotoalbum; on a picture _ and video viewer. you can launch it from the preview as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">The viewer can see you. of course, it shows the image, but additional all the information you have entered about the image, such as who is on the picture, when and where it was made, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the info box on the upper part of the image you want to see, you can simply drag it with the mouse and discard anywhere else. you can also configure which information is displayed and whether any information should be displayed. all of these options are available after a right-click on the viewer. the then appearing context menu can be seen below.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the info box are underlined. if you click here the browser, see, appropriate entries to this display. if you click on Anne Helene, the browser will show you all images of Anne Helene. as if you had selected people from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have loaded multiple images in the viewer, you can switch between them before and back by using the image image high and down. you can jump to the first and last image with Pos1 and end. these functions can also be reached from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If several images are loaded in the viewer, you can run them as slides. & kphotoalbum; then load a new image after a few seconds. how often it loads a new image can be checked by pressing the Ctrl key and plus or minus.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful feature of the viewer from & kphotoalbum; is it able to switch to full screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the complete space on the screen. simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">When you use the viewer you can move into the image and zoom out. to zoom in, you can simply draw a rectangle with the mouse. with the minus key, you can zoom out again. the plus button zooms in the middle of the image. shows how a zoom area is selected and shows the result of the zooms.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the point button you can reset your zoom, so that the image is not zoomed. with the power button sets the zoom, so that every pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoom operations work on videos that are in and out with the plus and minus key.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the functions from the context menu, you can rotate the image. this does not work with videos. you can make comments to the current image using the menu item annotations from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you look at images it may happen that you find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to set on the image. at the moment you can preview the image and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter this name. but you may prefer to select only the image and look at other images.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper. to see which photos you want you can launch the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad as you look one by one.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer gives you the possibility to paint pictures with features while you view them. features are the letters A to Z and you can make a feature by pressing the corresponding letters. in this you see a picture where the characters A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have set features on your images, you can see them in your browser. so, if you have all the images you edit, print or whatever you have selected, then you can simply add all the images at once with annotations. this is described in detail. after that you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features can be displayed in preview screen. if you view categories in particular preview screen, then you can add characters to the images by simply pressing the letter for the attribute after the image has been selected. you can see this here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture. in this case, you are allowed to paint on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The batch is not saved with the image, but in the database. in this way you can undo your painted later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In order to see the painting mode of & kphotoalbum; switch on the image from the context menu. to terminate the painting, simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To work with & kpovmodeler; you need to use the application of the program & Povray; not fully master, but the documentation to & Povray; should you have absolutely read and understood.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree you can select individual objects. then their properties are displayed in the object properties and displayed the object in the wire modell- views yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects at the same time. but not the object of an already selected object, since all objects are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object into the object tree, select the position you want to insert the object and click either the icon in the toolbar or select a menu item in the Insert menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are several possible positions, the following drop-down menu will be displayed to enable you to select the correct position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">By deleting either from the menu bar under Edit or from the right mouse button context menu, you can remove selected objects from the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have changed attributes, click Apply to Apply this Changes. if you entered invalid values, a message will appear with a fault description. then you can correct the input errors and click Apply or reject the changes with Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="1019">If you enter the path to & Povray; -User documentation in the setup dialog, you can call the & Povray; reference to the displayed object with help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this feature. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 already contains the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">When you edit a texture or part of a texture, you can see a preview in the property view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press ahead in the property view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture. as a default, the entire texture is rendered, even if you want to render a part of the texture (for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map), cross local.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screen shot shows the control points of the camera. you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is selected, the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view. this cross marks the center for scaling and rotation as well as the position for shifts. you can change the shift by dragging with the mouse within the entire window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a stage of view as a wire model. you can indicate this value relative to the level of view of the superordinate object or as absolute value. objects are only displayed if they are selected or their view level is smaller or equal to the Visibility level of the scene selected in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window arrangement as default. the object tree and view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical viewpoints on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the standard window ordering or if you need a different arrangement, you can set it as desired. you can also store multiple window orders and switch between different arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window over or below a view, drag the beginner to the top or bottom of a view. a rectangle then displays the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the beginner to the right or left side of a view. the new view is then anchored on the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to arrange multiple views on top of each other, drag the beginner in the middle of a different view. you can then switch between the views by clicking on the tabs at the top of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window arrangement are floating views: views which are not anchored in the main window. to solve a view from the anchorage, drag the beginner to the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing left above in the beginning strip.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view, click on the small cross at the beginning strip. to prevent closing, click on the small square between the arrow and the cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can add additional views to the main window. in the View menu, you will find entries for each type of views. new views are floating, you can anchor them at any location.</seg>
<seg id="1034">The current window view can be saved with View Window order... Save. a dialog appears where you can save the window order under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene, you can render them. & kpovmodeler; used & Povray; 3.1g to render, this program must be properly installed. as this manual was written, & Povray; 3.5 currently. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To rename the current scene, click the Rendering icon in the toolbar or select the menu item View scene renders.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A render mode corresponds to the entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and the quality of rendering. if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can insert any number of render modes, from a quick preview to full pictures of the highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar or View Render modes in the View menu, the following dialog will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each Render mode has a name. you can enter any name, but it makes sense to specify the properties of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the box size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image. if you want to render only a small area of the image, select the check box subsection and enter the image section for rendering in the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In the combination field quality you can select the properties, the & Povray; used for rendering. this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diffuse reflection lighting. a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the user manual to & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">When a picture is rendered with only a ray per pixel, various errors can occur. these images often have a Moiré pattern or step effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than one pixel in the image. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to decrease the influence of these errors. generally, pictures with this feature look better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you switch on anti-aliasing, compute and connect & Povray; more than a beam per pixel. this technique is super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because the super-sampling describes the neighbouring pixels. the second method is adaptive-recursive; recursively because each pixel is continuously divided and adapted because the recursion depth depends on the calculated color values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method, POV-Ray tracks a beam per pixel. if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels exceeds the specified threshold, then both pixels will be calculated by the tracking of a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you set the depth value to 4, a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated, with a depth value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional beams per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: r 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference then is:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 beams per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold, then the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixels, which are traced separately and tested for further subdivision. the maximum depth of the recursion can be set with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the generation of noise for the beam process called Jittering. if you switch to Jittering, change & Povray; the rays get a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last adjustment for the quality of rendering is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental feature of & Povray; that calculates diffuse light reflection. it takes a very long time to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map you can specify whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent if the associated rays have not hit the object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for displaying & Povray; console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly quit, you can find the reason here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray; import the menu item File Import... and select a file in the dialog box.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently supports & kpovmodeler; not yet the full command set of & Povray; if error messages or warnings occur when importing, a dialog box displays a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not support source text in & kpovmodeler; import this source text between the two special comments / / * PMRwBegin and / / * PMRwend.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for & Povray; this adds the source code of the object into the opened text file in the editor. to import objects to the scene, simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copy and paste in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can insert source code for & Povray; also insert.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler; a scene renders. usually this is povray or x-povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click help in the property view, open & kpovmodeler; the & Povray; user documentation to the displayed object. insert here the path to your document and the version. the versions 3.1g and 3.5 will be supported.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (e.g. altimeter information) in the paths to the & Povray; libraries. if you include files that are not in the directory of the scene, you must also enter the path to these files here. if a file is found in different paths of the library, the first found file is used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The color for the wire models. the second color is used for displaying the selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for the control points. the second color is used for displaying the selected control points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle for the field of view in camera view and window type plates.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the object catch of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views. you can set the grid separately for shifts, scaling and rotation.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values result in a more accurate wire model and therefore a better approximation for the displayed objects, but require more time for rendering. for some objects such as the ball, you can set the level of detail separately for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">When you cross high detail fidelity for advanced projections, all wire model views are further divided when the camera uses an extended projection. advanced projections are all projections with exceptions of perspective and vertical projections. this feature results in a better approach for projections, but requires more time for rendering.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you view the wall, a wall behind the objects is rendered. the wall is represented in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colours.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you view the floor, a floor below the objects is rendered. the floor is represented in a chess board pattern consisting of two adjustable colours.</seg>
<seg id="1070">When you check box smoothing, the non-recursive anti-aliasing method is used for rendering the scenes. the values for depth and threshold value can be set. exact information about parameters can be found in the Render modes section.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can change existing window orders or create new window orders. in the section of window orders, it explains how to create and save window orders.</seg>
<seg id="1072">Drop down selector standard window arrangement: displays all existing window orders. & kpovmodeler; uses the selected window order at the start of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of existing window orders shows all existing window orders. a new arrangement can be created using the Add button and deleting a selected arrangement with the button Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Each window ordering is identified by the name. the name must be unique and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list under the name shows all the views for the selected window arrangement. new views can be created using the button Add and Delete selected views with the button Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with Neue Clear you create a new column on the right-hand side of the existing windows, with weeds you anchor the window under the existing window, with tab card you get a card map view together with the previous view and floats the view not in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you just have & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you want to start without more accurate knowledge of both programs. if you follow all steps in this guide, you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene, among beginners very popular: a ball on a plane.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that as a result you only get a black screen. if you use a 3D program for the first time, you should consider these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you don't set a camera, no rules can be applied for rendering, as a result you get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you do not insert light sources, your entire scene is in the dark and you only get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have installed everything error-free, see the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following default window ordering:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and the icons of the toolbar. please read the documentation so you can get an adequate idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will often have to use these menus and symbols, so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide, you first need to remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select the menu item Edit Delete. so you now have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire model view shows how the camera looks at the whole scene you create. in particular, you will notice this in the fourth wire model view (right below). this is the view of the scene from the perspective of the camera. this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera. if you click on it, you will see the content of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found. in the user documentation to & Povray; see more details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change the basic settings of the camera, this is reserved for later instructions, but note that the camera has control points to change the target point of the camera. just click on a control point with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired place.</seg>
<seg id="1088">When you press the Apply button or the Enter key, the wire model views and the object tree will change immediately according to these settings. as a result, you will see the scene from the view of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the ground for the scene. you could, for example, insert a header (insert Finite body Quader) and the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a cumbersome method to solve this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; in fact provides a simpler way. you can use an infinite plane as floor:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: choose the plain in the object tree, change the name and then press the Apply button or enter the Enter key. in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire model view now also displays the level, albeit at the moment only as a finite level. if you render the scene, the plane expands to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you look at the object tree carefully, you will find that you can fold the entry for the floor if you click on the item + in front of the object. in this case you will only see the default options for each new object: scaling, rotation, and shift. select one of these options, also change the possible settings in the view of the object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene you should move the floor to the exercise a unit under the horizontal line, only to get to know some of these parameters. select Shift and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First select the floor to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but at the moment, choose something simple.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases, a dialog box opens, in which you can select how to insert the object. please select First object. you can change the name in the property view (name = ground pigment), with a click on the button preview you will see how the pigment looks now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course the preview of the pigment is just a matte black material because you still need to enter settings for the pigment. always remember that you can check the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview. also, there are many possibilities again, but take the easiest now.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you do not see any color on the header and sphere, click on the Apply button and then preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now set correctly. if you render your image now with a click on the icon, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">In the color list you have to enter two new attributes, called one-colored. in the object tree you have to enter two new attributes, called one-colored. then edit this entry twice (you can also do this more frequently, but the board color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In the object tree, select the object tree each time and change the colors in the view of the properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">This step you should be able to do as you have understood the basic working method of & kpovmodeler; you should have understood it just as easy as the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In view of the object properties, you can instantly change the settings. set the value for the radius: to 1 (do not forget to press the enter key or the button Apply), so the ball has contact with the ground. otherwise, the ball would float above the ground as you have moved the ground around one unit downwards.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course the rendering now results in a strange result: as you can see before, the ball surface appears like a matte black material. in the following step, put a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have chosen the ball, you can now assign a material to it. as already on the floor, give the ball a pigment as color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select First Subject and change the name for example in sphere Pigment. click on sphere pigment, then select one color and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as in the following screenshots and click Apply or press the Enter key.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The glitter effect and reflection result in some good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed surfaces, even if metallic: not yet selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of the possibilities offered by you & kpovmodeler; hopefully you have learnt so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracycing is a render method to generate a two dimensional picture of a three dimensional scene or a model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">When you trace a scene raytracen, the renderer shoots hypothetical beams from the perspective of the viewer (i.e. from the camera that renders the scenes) through each pixel in the scene. the render calculates how this ray effects through the objects and impacts atmospheric effects such as fog. thus, the scene pixel is processed for pixels.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you won't see anything without a camera, the camera is your eye with which you view the scene. without a light source you also don't see anything, the picture is simply black. obviously, every scene needs to be rendered, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog, you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the default file dialog, you can select a file that you created previously with & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open or create a new model, the file will be inserted into this sub-menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have already saved the model, it will be saved under the same name. if it is a new file, you must enter a name and a memory space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Restores the scene in the last saved version. all changes since the last storage have been discarded.</seg>
<seg id="1119">This menu entry can only be selected if you have not saved any saved changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the recently reversed command. you can only select this menu item if you have not used the Edit menu.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Stores the current window arrangement and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new order or overwrite an existing order.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you will find options for setting & kpovmodeler; here you can change the look, keyboard shortcuts and the default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog to change the shortcut keys. you can use this option to set default shortcuts for & kpovmodeler; modify commands or add new ones.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog to set up the toolbar. you can use this option to add and remove toolboxes for & kpovmodeler.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A bump map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to individually shape any bump on the surface and without changing the geometric shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file for a bump map as well as a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic objects are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies. these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic look.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel basis by applying an image file as a color card.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& ball show; is a comfortable image viewer and browser. the application has a file browser where you can select images for viewing.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can either be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & ball show; is very simple. the file browser lists files that you can use by clicking the & LMBn; or the Return key.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can adjust if any image should be displayed in your own window, or if all images should always use the same window.</seg>
<seg id="1133">If you are looking for a specific file type, simply type the first character of the file name in the browser window. then a small input field appears in the lower right corner. if a matching file name has been found, the file will be highlighted. you can leave the input field by pressing Return or & Esc.</seg>
<seg id="1134">In the dialogue setting - & ball show; there are five cards. in three of them, General and editing and slide show, you can set the mode of operation of & ball show; in the two other, short commands for the display window and short instructions for the browser, the keyboard shortcuts can be specified for the respective windows.</seg>
<seg id="1135">If this is selected, the images will be opened in full screen mode. if the image is not large enough to fill the screen, the rest of the display area will be filled with the background color you can set down below. default is not full screen mode.</seg>

<seg id="1183">The DCOP interface of Amarok has many common functions, mostly found in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the DCOP functions of collection, context browser, player, playlist, playlist browsers and scripts. an example call for the DCOP function pause could be & zb; look like this:</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports the command line options of Qt and & kde; in addition, Amarok has some command line options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user feedback when the script cannot be executed because of a lack of dependency. please check in your script to see if all required modules are present and use kdialog so that the user knows why a script does not run.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Begin require 'Korundum' Rescue LoadError error = 'Corundum (KDE bindings for ruby) from kdebindings v3.4 is required for this script.' kdialog --sorry '# {error}' 'exit</seg>
<seg id="1187">In scripts / templates you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply add them to the required functions. you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively easy.</seg>
<seg id="1188">With the help of DCOP, your scripts can exchange data with Amarok and control Amarok. the easiest way is to use the dcop command, which should be included in each KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most script languages make it possible to execute external programs and commands. this usually uses the exec () function. in this way, dcop &gt; can be called relatively easily. here's an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& Amarok; sends alerts to all running scripts. for this purpose strings are written to the default execution of the script. for this reason, scripts should constantly monitor their default input and react accordingly to events. of course, a script can also ignore events if there is no use for it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure Weist the script to display the setup dialog. to store and load the set-up data, each script itself must take care of. when a script is started, Amarok places the working folder on the folder where all data should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange signalizes that a new piece is alluded. the script could now ask for more information about the new piece using DCOP functions (for example metadata or unit length).</seg>
<seg id="1193">VolumeChange newVolume signals a change in volume. the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">CustommenuClicked: submenu itemTitle Traces the path to the selected playlist files when a user defined menu entry is clicked. submenu and itemTitle will also be passed to allow the script to rev the clicked entry. to remove an entry, you can use dcop Amarok script removeCustomMenuItem (Submenu itemTitle).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & Amarok; finished, or when the user stops a script, sends & Amarok; the signal SIGTERM to the script. this signal should be processed, e.g., storing data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks script management can also install script packages that the user has downloaded from a web server. such packages are basically normal Tar archives (.tar), which can optionally also be compressed with bzip2 (.bz2). we recommend an archive name such as voskript.amarokscript.tar.bz2 so that the user can clearly recognize the archive as a Amarok script package.</seg>
<seg id="1197">& Amarok; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the exporting catamarocscript. for this reason you should rename your script packages correctly.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main script must be executable (+ x), the remaining modules should not be executable. use the Tar parameter -p to obtain the file permissions:</seg>
<seg id="1199">When your script package is ready, you can hang it to www.kde-apps.org and attach the link to the Wiki Skrill page of & Amarok; for your entry in kde-apps you should use the Amarok. script.</seg>
<seg id="1200">& Amarok; is an audio player for & kde;. & Amarok; has many useful and powerful functions and is surprisingly easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1201">With & Amarok; you can simply drag music into the playlist rather than having to browse through endless menus. maybe you're just looking for a very specific title from thousands in your collection. with & Amarok; 's Collecting Browser and Quick Search, you will find the piece within seconds.</seg>
<seg id="1202">You may have a number of playlists, but you can never decide which you want to hear? then the playlist browser is just the right thing for you. and if the decision is still hard, the dynamic mode and the smart playlists will automatically select the right music according to certain criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1203">Amarok has excellent support for Apple's iPod, iRivers ifp and many generic USB devices. besides, many different audio systems can be used so you can choose how to listen to your music. these and many other useful functions make Amarok the most advanced audio player.

<seg id="1218">To keep up-to-date piece changes visible, it causes the playlist to scroll up / down to keep the current piece always visible in the visible window area.</seg>
<seg id="1219">When changing parts to context browser automatically changes the context browser as soon as the next piece is played.</seg>
<seg id="1220">In the Appearance you can customize the look & Amarok; the section is divided into three parts.</seg>
<seg id="1221">In the Fonts section you can select the use of different fonts in & Amarok; you can select fonts for the following area: playlist windows, player windows and context browser. click Select... so you can select a font you want from the selection dialog.</seg>

<seg id="1228">The screen option is intended for Xinama users, so you can specify on which screen of a multi-monitor environment the OSD is supposed to appear.</seg>
<seg id="1229">The card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop-down box. some drivers still activate more settings in this card.</seg>
<seg id="1230">The collection card collection is used to set up all settings for your collection. this includes the folder and the type of database for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1231">Here you can select the folder that & Amarok; search for music files. to include a folder in the collection, select the check box next to its name. this section also contains check boxes for setting the selected folders.</seg>
<seg id="1232">Browse subfolders recursively: this causes & Amarok to search for music both the selected and their subfolders.</seg>
<seg id="1233">Monitor Changes: enables & Amarok to monitor the selected folders on changes (e.g. if music files are added or deleted). in addition, an incremental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection.</seg>
<seg id="1234">Import playlists: causes & Amarok to add all found playlists to your collection folder (.pl- and .m3u files) to your collection. the automatically added playlists will later appear in the playlist browser.</seg>
<seg id="1235">The Collection Database is used to select a database for the collection. the drop down selector driver: lets you choose between SQLite or MySql. if MySql is selected, additional set-up in the MySql subwindow is necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1236">The MySql setup section is used to set the database for & Amarok; on calculator: specify the host on which the MySql database is located. after that, the network port is entered, under which the database is accessible. name: is the database name to which the connection is established.</seg>
<seg id="1237">Use Username: and Password: to enter the data needed for connection to the database.</seg>

<seg id="1242">& Amarok; is an audio player for Unix systems (like & zb; Linux). more information can be found in the summary of the functions and the gallery with screenshots.</seg>
<seg id="1243">Amarok just needs the package kdelibs and otherwise no other KDE packages. so you need to have kdelibs installed (including the programs included in it, because & Amarok; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts). we have written a little guide on how to compile kdelibs minimal.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some functions such as the OSD require that your window manager contains the relevant standards of freedesktop.org. Gnome will work, but fluxbox will work for example. we try to support Amarok on all platforms, so we use kdelibs and Qt because these provide an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">Probably one of your files causes an error in the Taglib library for days. you can locate the file by searching in ~ / .kde / share / apps / Amarok / collection _ scan.log. please report this error to the Taglib Developer at bugs.kde.org and also append the broken file that caused the crash. after that, you can delete the file and leave the collection again.</seg>
<seg id="1246">It is mostly because Taglib crashes when reading the meta information from this file. please report this error to the Taglib Developer at bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you are using MySQL as a database, try SQLite. support for it in & Amarok; is somewhat more sophisticated.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure that all of & Amarok; used libraries are compiled with the same compiler version. if, for example, & Amarok; compiled with GCC 3.4, Taglib but with GCC 3.3.X, then this leads to crashes when processing meta information.</seg>
<seg id="1249">If you are using KDE with artsd then disable autom. switch off if inactive for... in setting the sound system, or at least use no value of 1 second.</seg>
<seg id="1250">You can also send us the backtrace via e-mail (the e-mail automatically opens during a crash). if it is a common crash and you send us a good backtrace, the error will be fixed.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is because many programs write data as UTF-8 in the meta information, but they do not feature Unicode. the following Perl script fixes the problem.</seg>

<seg id="1272">If you use the GStreamer driver with the Alsa-sink, the device must provide a blender. a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously output audio. this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixer (e.g. SBLive) or by the dmix module for Alsa (software mixer).</seg>
<seg id="1273">The output of this command should help you find the cause of the problem and a solution. you may need to provide a different sink for GStreamer (e.g. osssink).</seg>
<seg id="1274">This does & Amarok; already. don't forget that media must first be decoded. you can't simply send an MP3 to ALSA, you would only hear a white noise. GStreamer is reading the file, decode it and sends the PCM data to ALSA. exactly like XMMS.</seg>

<seg id="1287">This command lets & Amarok; start playing. make sure that & Amarok; runs before going to bed, then you are woken up by the soft tones of the music that you stopped before going to bed.</seg>
<seg id="1288">How to get the current song in & Amarok; learn running titles if you're on a different computer?</seg>
<seg id="1289">If there is a working SSH environment, you can proceed as follows. this command gives you the interpreter and the title of the running piece: SSH -i ~ / .ssh / id _ rsa ihreIP dcop --user ihreusable name Amarok player nowPlaying</seg>
<seg id="1290">Replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username. this presupposes that your identification is in ~ / .ssh / id _ rsa file.</seg>
<seg id="1291">Visualizations can be separated from & Amarok; click on the keyboard and the current analyzer will open in an independent window in the size modifiable window.</seg>
<seg id="1292">The combination of Ctrl + right mouse button puts a piece in the click sequence into the queue. pressing the Enter key after a search in the playlist will play the first search result and reset the search.</seg>
<seg id="1293">OK, the player window and the playlist have tricky features, but how does the icon in the system section of the control bar look like?</seg>
<seg id="1294">Click the & RMBn; on the title of a browser. in the context menu, you can select which browsers should be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1295">My Personal Folder $HOME is located on a NFS drive. after the start of Amarok the collection database cannot be created and many error messages appear on the console. what now?</seg>
<seg id="1296">The internal SQLite database of & Amarok; does not work with NFS. either you need to link ~ / .kde / share / apps / Amarok to a local drive, or use Amaroks MySQL support.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Insert the CD, then click on Audio CD in the menu. it opens a file browser with multiple folders. for normal reading, switch to the wav folder, select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a Konqueror window. instead, you can use files from the folders mp3 or ogg instead.</seg>
<seg id="1298">QStringList values = query (QString ("SELECT player counter, createdate," FROM statistics "" WHERE url = '% 1'; ') .arg (escapeString (url)));</seg>
<seg id="1299">Basically, this adjusts the previous assessment with a decreasing value, based on how often the piece was played. the more often the piece was played, the less influence each individual rating has on the overall result.</seg>
<seg id="1300">You can enter the rating for a piece by clicking on a column heading in the playlist window with the right mouse button. then you can change the rating of a piece as well as all other attributes, namely by clicking on the piece by right-clicking on the piece and editing: selecting a rating or pressing F2. you can also edit the rating in the Metadata dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1301">The developers don't want you to tell you when you want to release a stable version of Amarok. this means: KDE packages have a set release plan that will not be combined with the short-term scheduled plan of Amarok.</seg>
<seg id="1302">This is a new function in Amarok, which some users can also find annoying. deactivate the option icon while playing animate in the general settings.</seg>
<seg id="1303">The Analyzer is part of the toolbar. select Setting Settings... and take the desired changes there.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Download a design, or create your own. then install it under Amarok... Appearance Context browser design, click New Design....</seg>
<seg id="1305">The icon was similar to the logo of Warp Graphics Inc. (elfquest.com). to avoid difficulties, it was removed.</seg>
<seg id="1306">Konqueror Navigation Pane allows you to monitor and control & Amarok; while browsing the Konqueror tab. then start Konqueror and press F9 to view the navigation pane. then click on the Settings button (top) and select Add Amarok to drop down menu.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Audio crobat is a free service to the information about which pieces are played on an independent server. the service is free and you only need a free username and password. Audioscrobbler is fully supported by & Amarok; supported.</seg>
<seg id="1308">If you want to use ALSA, please use the latest version available. old ALSA versions have a lot of crashes and therefore a lot of error reports.</seg>
<seg id="1309">Probably & Amarok; compiled before you have installed xine or GStreamer. therefore, the. / configure routine does not compile these output modules. you need to reconfigure and install Amarok; reconfigure and install.</seg>
<seg id="1310">Now I & Amarok; new installed, but the output modules still don't appear. and now?</seg>
<seg id="1311">Probably you use a distribution that installs the development files separately from the actual program. although GStreamer is installed, the necessary developer files are missing. you now have to install the GStreamer-devel package. the same goes for xine, you need to install xine-devel. then you need to recompile and install again.</seg>
<seg id="1312">I get the error GStreamer-CRITICAL * *: factory for 'Adder's no type.. How can I fix it?</seg>
<seg id="1313">Your version of GStreamer was compiled with Prelinking, which is incompatible with GStreamer. you must compile GStreamer without Prelinking. a tip from merlin-tc: use no LDFLAGS when you compile Amarok.</seg>
<seg id="1314">I get the error message There is no element present to handle the file's mimetype audia / mp4, although the module GStreamer-faad is installed.</seg>
<seg id="1315">In order to play mp4 or m4a files with GStreamer, the GStreamer-quicktime module must also be installed next to GStreamer-faad.</seg>
<seg id="1316">The present is no element present to handle the stream's mimetype audio / mpeg.</seg>
<seg id="1317">You play an MP3 Stream, but the module GStreamer-mad is not installed. install the module and then run it as a system administrator. then restart Amarok.</seg>
<seg id="1318">I have a second sound card and use ALSA. how can I use Amarok to use the second sound card?</seg>
<seg id="1319">Set up the Amarok settings... audio output you enter the device. typically, e.g. hw: 0 for the default sound card and hw: 1 for the second one.</seg>
<seg id="1320">Here is an example of ~ / .asoundrc on a machine with an onboard AC97 codec and a USB audio device:</seg>
<seg id="1321">Pcm.intel8x0 {type plug slave.pcm "hw: 0"} ctl.intel8x0 {type hw card 0} pcm.usb-audio {type plug slave.pcm "hw: 1" ctl.usb-audio {type hw card 1}</seg>
<seg id="1322">Enter in the setup dialog from xine now usb-audio, and the output takes place on the USB sound card. so-lib takes care of the conversion of sampling rate, channels and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1323">If you want to use a virtual dmix device, disable the check on soundcard supports mmap.</seg>
<seg id="1324">We are sorry, but the audio output with Arts will not be taken care of. you can of course take this problem by yourself! if you want, you can become the new so urgently needed tutor for arts:)</seg>
<seg id="1325">Listening to music should be quite simple! for this reason, there is the setup assistant that is displayed at the first start of & Amarok; if you want to update your collection later or simply don't like the wizard, then this quick start guide will help you. with your help you will have set up & Amarok; set up in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1326">Creating a playlist is very simple. drag items from the collection browser to the playlist. if you are happy with the playlist, you can save it by using the Playlist button. if you are happy with the playlist, you can save it by using the Playlist button. you will find this button in the toolbar of the playlist window.</seg>
<seg id="1327">If you have your own playlists, you can add them to the playlist browser. if the playlist is included in the folders of your collection, and you have the option to import playlists, you'll find different ways to load the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1328">To play an audio CD, select Actions Audio CD in the menu bar. it opens a file browser with multiple folders and the CD pieces in WAV format. simply drag the wav files into the playlist and then press the playback button.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The audio CD function uses the protocol Audiocd: / and is not compatible with all available drivers.</seg>
<seg id="1330">The burning function can also be found in the playlist. just click on one entry with the right mouse button and follow the burning menu. you have here different ways to burn a CD.</seg>
<seg id="1331">& Amarok; presets the installation of some software packages. the required packages are listed below. in addition, some additional packages are listed that make work with & Amarok; more enjoyable.</seg>
<seg id="1332">If you install these packages via a package management system (e.g. RPM or apt), you also need to install the development versions of these packages!</seg>
<seg id="1333">& Amarok; is a versatile multimedia player. it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control. as any normal multimedia player has also & Amarok; a player window with the most important functions. additionally, & Amarok; however, a playlist that is superior to all others. additionally, the playlist window contains several browsers that can capture and browse your entire music collection.</seg>
<seg id="1334">In this chapter, it explains how all the functions of & Amarok; used, including creating a collection and a playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1335">The Player Window is your one-click & Amarok; control center. at the top of the window is a scroll text display showing the currently running piece or the current stream. directly below is the area, the playing time, bit rate and samplerate of the current play. a click on this area changes the display of the currently expired play time for the remaining part of the play.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In addition, the Player window contains a selection of audio analyzers, also under the runtime display. you can switch by the available analyzer by clicking the left mouse button on the area.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The & Amarok; Analyzer can be separated from the Player window. press d on your keyboard and the current analyzer is displayed in an independent, enlarged window.</seg>
<seg id="1338">The PL and EQ buttons are also displayed under the scroll text display. the button PL activates or deactivates the playlist window while the EQ button is used to set the equalizer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">The rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons, the volume control and the piece position slider. use the sliders to adjust the piece position or volume. with the playback buttons you can start / stop playback and change to the next or previous piece.</seg>
<seg id="1340">Using the built-in equalizer is simple and works with all audio drivers. there are 17 presets from classic to techno, and you can easily create your own preferences.</seg>
<seg id="1341">To display the equalizer, use Tools Equalizer from the main menu or click the EQ button in the player window. once you select the check box Equalizer, the equalizer is in operation.</seg>
<seg id="1342">The playlist of & Amarok; is the most advanced playlist of all for & kde; available multimedia players. it has many features that do not exist in any other player. but don't let the abundance of functions deter you, they are all easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The Playlist window can be divided into two main areas, the left side is the navigation pane. in the navigation pane you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist, such as the context browser. the playlist is easy to use and yet even for advanced users powerful enough.</seg>
<seg id="1344">The context browser displays various information regarding the current piece. its look can be adjusted with the help of context-browser designs. the context browser contains three sub-windows: music, text and interpreter. these three sub-windows will later be explained in detail.</seg>
<seg id="1345">If you have earlier versions of & Amarok; you might notice that the subwindow will have dropped off. the information presented here is now divided into other parts of & Amarok; the information in the Statistics window can also be viewed (Extras statistics).</seg>
<seg id="1346">The subwindow music shows information about the current piece, as well as the artist and the album.</seg>
<seg id="1347">The first section in this sub-window displays information about the piece. in the title there is the name of the piece, artist and the album. below you see the cover picture of the album and next to it a MusicBrainz symbol. click on this icon to track the piece in the MusicBrainz database.</seg>
<seg id="1348">Under the MusicBrainz symbol you will find more information about the current piece. you can see here how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="1349">To display cover images in context browser, the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece. file formats .jpg, .jpeg, .gif and .png are supported. the context browser will also display cover images which are either downloaded with the cover management or embedded in ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1350">The next area, Recommended pieces, lists several recommended pieces. if you click on one of these pieces, it will play instantaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1351">Among the recommended pieces are the favourite pieces of this interpreter. this area shows the five most rated pieces of the current interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1352">You can set which information to be displayed in the music subwindow. click with the right mouse button somewhere in the subwindow and select from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1353">The last section, albums of the artist, lists all the albums of the current artist you have in your collection. if you click on an album, it will work out and you will see the content of the album.</seg>
<seg id="1354">You can click on all the pieces in the individual areas to start playing immediately. you can also click on it with the right mouse button and then select one of the options for adding the piece or album to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1355">This function is very flexible and it is possible to download text from other web pages using self-written scripts. as soon as you click on the text subwindow, try & Amarok; to download the text for the piece from the Internet. if no text script is running, you can choose which to start.</seg>
<seg id="1356">The Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics. the modified version is then stored in & Amarok; s collection database. this does not require a running text script.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The Search button opens a search on google.com based on the lyrics for the current piece (in an external browser window).</seg>
<seg id="1358">Grouping Interpret - only grouped the top level, each piece is displayed directly below the interpreter. albums or genres are disregarded.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Grouping Artist / Album - First the pieces will be sorted by performer and below will be a further division after the respective album. if you want to see compilations or soundtrack albums, this is the best view of your collection - these albums will be shown at the beginning of the list under various performers.</seg>
<seg id="1360">Grouping Artist / Year - Album - Sort by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order (the latest first). if the year is unknown for an album, the default 0 - album name is related.</seg>
<seg id="1361">Grouping Album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabetically and will be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1362">Grouping Genre / Artist - your pieces will be sorted by genre and sorted by artist.</seg>
<seg id="1363">Grouping Genre / Artist / Album - This setting works exactly the same way as the above, but is additionally sorted by album underneath the performer.</seg>
<seg id="1364">With the help of the remaining buttons, you can customize the grouping as you like.</seg>
<seg id="1365">With the last button you can change the settings to the collection. note: & Amarok; will automatically record your collection once you change something at the selected folders. if you own lots of pieces, this might take a while.</seg>
<seg id="1366">A search filter is located directly below the toolbar. it behaves in the list view as well as in the tree view. notes on how to use this filter can be found in the section to the playlist in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1367">Under the search filter there is a selection field, which allows you to filter out the recently added pieces to your collection. you can also choose different time windows, starting from the last 24 hours to one year. furthermore, you can of course also select your total collection, which makes the filter practically switched off.</seg>
<seg id="1368">By clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser, you will receive the following options.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Load - This empties the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces in the currently valid order in playback.</seg>
<seg id="1370">To add a playlist - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist. by double-clicking on an entry, you can reach the same effect.</seg>
<seg id="1371">Set pieces in queue - This function inserts the selected pieces into the queue. this will then be played next.</seg>
<seg id="1372">Save as a playlist... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist. you will be asked for a name under which the list is to be saved.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Transfer Media Player - Add the pieces into the queue for transfer to the Media Player. for more details, see the section on the Media Player Browser.</seg>
<seg id="1374">Burn all pieces of this interpreter / burn to CD - This will cause the selected pieces to be sent to K3b and either as data or audio CD burned. if K3b is not installed, this option is not displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Edit metadata (for n pieces)... - This opens the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1376">(s) Move files to the trash bin... - Open a confirmation dialog. if you confirm it, the selected files will be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="1377">Mark as a compilation - Select the selected album as a compilation, and it appears under different interpreters.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Highlight collection marking - Changes a single album marked as a compilation album back into a normal album. after that the album will no longer be displayed under various performers but again by the associated performer.</seg>
<seg id="1379">The playlist browser makes handling of playlists very easy. among other things, it also includes Intelligent Playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1380">The lower part of the playlist browser contains the smart playlists. these use & Amarok; s built-in database to automatically create some useful playlists at runtime. the smart playlists consist of:</seg>
<seg id="1381">Never played: a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Even created smart playlists are possible. click Smart Playlist to open the dialog to create a new Smart playlist. there you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1383">The Media Player subwindow is used to connect & Amarok; using your portable media player (e.g. iPod). to be able to use your iPod with & Amarok; for example, to include your iPod with & Amarok; in / mnt / ipod. if & Amarok; launched, you will find the pieces on your iPod sorted by performer in the upper list view of the Media Player browser.</seg>
<seg id="1384">To transfer pieces to your iPod, drag the desired songs from the playlist and drop them to the list interpreter. if you're done, click Apply. this will upload the pieces to your iPod. if the transfer is finished, exit & Amarok; and release the drive connection for your iPod.</seg>
<seg id="1385">Under the toolbar, there is a search area with which you can search for a file. the search is particularly useful in folders with very many files because in the file list all the files are hidden which do not match your search criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1386">In the lower part of the file browser you will find an address bar that lets you retrieve music from a given URL. if you enter tar: / home / mike / music.tar.gz and press enter key, you can access music in the music .tar.gz file. now you can drag and drop the music from there into the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1387">If the playlist is longer than in the window, the appendix of the Shift key can be difficult. in this case, the holding down of the Shift key can be helpful: this will automatically insert dropped files at the end of the list, and not the mouse position.</seg>
<seg id="1388">The playlist retains all of the pieces you want to play. you can change the order by simply dragging the entries with the mouse to the desired place. once you enter letters, only the pieces will be displayed, which contain the letters. to reset the filter, press the back button until the text field is empty again.</seg>
<seg id="1389">If you enter search terms separated by spaces, & Amarok; search for entries containing all keywords. if you enter, for example, two three, the search will find all the entries that contain one, two, and three.</seg>
<seg id="1390">If you enter OR between the search terms OR, search for entries containing either one or the other search term. for example, one OR two OR three. in this example, all pieces are found that contain one or two or three (or a combination thereof).</seg>
<seg id="1391">If you want to search for entries containing spaces, then enclose the search term with quotation marks: Mike Oldfield. this will search for entries that Mike Oldfield contain, but not according to requests such as Mike J. Oldfield.</seg>
<seg id="1392">If you specify a specific search column, you can also search for larger or smaller. for example: evaluation: &gt; 50. this searches for pieces that have a higher rating than 50.</seg>
<seg id="1393">If you want to search for a piece that does not contain a certain keyword, set a minus sign in front of the search term: -something looks for pieces that do not contain anything.</seg>
<seg id="1394">You can combine these syntax variations as you like. for example: Mike Oldfield OR score: &gt; 50 -comment: bathroom. this searches for all the pieces that either contain Mike Oldfield, or have a higher score than 50 and do not include the comment pool.</seg>
<seg id="1395">You can set the sequence of entries by pressing the Ctrl key, then clicking with the right mouse button in the desired order on the entries. the entries then receive a label with a number. the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played.</seg>
<seg id="1396">The toolbar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window. it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist. on the left you will find the button Add to Add to the Playlist. to the right, you will find playlist Save, Empty Empty and Random Mics.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Next, the knobs follow Undo and Restore. this allows you to undo or restore changes to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1398">In the middle of the toolbar, a unique, larger analyzer is located. the refresh rate can be set with a click of the right mouse button on the analyzer.</seg>
<seg id="1399">The last button in the toolbar is the menu. it opens the same menu as that which you get in the player window over the right mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="1400">There are many more available buttons for the toolbar, for example, playback control and volume control. you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on the menu and setting up toolbar buttons...</seg>
<seg id="1401">The status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about the playlist. it displays the title of the current piece, the number of pieces and the total playing time of all pieces. in addition, the status for random mode and retrieval is easy to change by clicking the mouse twice in the respective display area.</seg>
<seg id="1402">You can also hide the status bar. to do so, disable the status bar option in the General Settings.</seg>
<seg id="1403">The context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window, or by clicking in the playlist on menu. by this menu you can reach the settings of & Amarok;</seg>
<seg id="1404">A click on this entry will open the visualisation plug-in window. there you can select the visualizations of & Amarok; select.</seg>
<seg id="1405">This entry contains a sub-menu with links to this document and other information about & Amarok;.</seg>
<seg id="1406">The cover management is a useful tool for managing your cover images. you can launch it by selecting actions cover management in the collection browser.</seg>
<seg id="1407">The cover management includes a list view of all albums in your collection. you can view all the albums of an interpreter in your collection by selecting the performer on the left.</seg>
<seg id="1408">With the View menu, you can choose what to display in the cover management. select from:</seg>
<seg id="1409">The queue management received your big draw in & Amarok; 1.3. with this function, you have more control over the playlist. after you've set a queue in the queue, a number next to the title appears in the playlist. this number represents the order in which & Amarok; the pieces will play: 1 is played first, 2 as second, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1410">When you want to add a piece to the queue, select the piece in the playlist and then click +. you can also simply add the pieces with the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist. you can then change the order of the pieces in the queue management.</seg>
<seg id="1411">There are three types of dynamic playlists, two of which are already pre-specified (see the details of how to set up these later).</seg>
<seg id="1412">Fill your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and add more random pieces while playing.</seg>
<seg id="1413">Adds pieces based on load .fm recommendations (formerly: Audioscrobbler). this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist. you don't need a Last.fm profile to use this dynamic playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1414">Double click on the playlist you want, drag it to the playlist window or right-click on it and then select Load. in this way, your current playlist is replaced by the new one. so you should save the old playlist under certain circumstances!</seg>
<seg id="1415">The two pre-set modes of Random Mix and Playlist Mix immediately fill up your playlist and you can start playing directly. the playlist Recommended pieces start with an empty playlist and you will have to add at least one piece of yourself from your collection, so your playlist will only be filled at the end of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1416">If you want to keep the current playlist, then enable the last possible dynamic mode: settings Dynamic mode. this will use your existing playlist as starting point. the dynamic mode can also be disabled via the same menu entry.</seg>

<seg id="1421">Played pieces - this is the number of pieces played at the beginning of the playlist. this allows you to easily see which pieces have been played recently.</seg>
<seg id="1422">This is the number of pieces that are to be added to the playlist by each played piece. if you set more than 1, then the playlist will continue to grow because only one piece can be played and removed.</seg>
<seg id="1423">The settings on the right-hand side are already described in the previous section. on the left side of the dialog you can select from already existing playlists or smart playlists. if you want to cross multiple playlists, & Amarok; random items from each of the playlists you want to cross.</seg>

<seg id="1483">& k3b; is, like many other & kde; -applications also equipped with a & DCOP; interface. with the help of this interface, parts of functionality can be controlled, for example, via a shell script.</seg>
<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP functions, you can either use the dcop command line program or the somewhat more convenient program Kdcop. both programs are identical in the range of functions, so your taste and type of task is crucial to which of the contributory programs you specify.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter, we assume that you use the dcop command line program. to use the & DCOP functions, you must first make sure that & k3b is started. then enter something like the following on the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">In addition to the general & DCOP; -functions that have all & kde; -program common, supports & k3b; mainly two more parts described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The DCOP-Interface from & k3b; provides functions such as copyCD, formatted DVD and other functions to create new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () void occupationCdrw () void occupationCdImage () void burnCdImage () void burndvdImage () void burndvdImage (KURL url)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method you get a DCOP reference to the newly created project: DCOPRef (k3b, K3bProject-0) Alternatively, you can create a project using the command line: # k3b --audiocd and then a reference to the project by using # dcop k3b K3bInterface currentProject By using this reference it is possible to change the project via K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the above listed K3bProjectInterface and the powerful K3bDataProjectInterface, which can only be used on data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void createFolder (QString name, QString Character) void addUrl (KURL url, Qstring parent) void addUrl (QString) void renameItem (QString) void renameItem (Qstring path, QString NewName) void travel volume id (QString id)</seg>
<seg id="1492">This makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, multiple folders, and then add files to the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT createFolder test dcop $PROJECT createFolder test dcop $PROJECT createFolder bar / foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder bar / foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder bar / foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder bar / foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder bar / foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder bar / foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder bar / foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder bar / foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder bar / foo dcop</seg>
<seg id="1494">& kaudiocreator; is an audio CD; an audio CD; easy to read audio CD; it can be read out and stored in MP3- or OGG files. also other formats are possible depending on encoder which is installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kaudiocreator; is the user interface of cdparanoia (for reading & CD; files in WAV files on the hard drive) and by many encoding that encodes these wav files (these Kodiers packages still need to be installed from the Linux distribution). more encoders can be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First, the tracks of the & CD; read out and saved into WAV files on the computer (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step, these WAV files (usually one per title) are compressed into the MP3 or OGG format or even in other formats such as lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD;, is used by & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not yet installed, this has to be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step you have to install lame (for MP3), oggvorbis (for OGG) or other Kodiers. all of these programs are usually already available for any Linux distributions, so it is probably not necessary to compile anything yourself. however, if FLAC is not used, its installation is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which encoding / file format should be used? the chapter Welcher Kodierer is a small introduction about encoders, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word to copy protected audio CD; s: as already said, uses & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia to read out the audio data from the & CD; this program is not intended to bypass some copy protection. in any case, & kaudiocreator; even avoid the mechanisms of copy protection. just avoid the purchase of copy-protected audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While setting up only needs to be done (the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration was found), afterwards the daily handling of reading a & CD; explained to the hard drive. this will (hopefully) lead to understanding for the lean approach of the user interface, which you will often stumble at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert into many formats - depending on which encoding programs are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>

<seg id="1510">Opens the Setup dialog to configure the type of notifications (such as logs, pices) for program events (such as read out & CD; finished).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main setup dialog of & kaudiocreator; with different card cards (such as encoder, to set up the encoder), you need to go here before the program can be successfully used!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, encoders, and compression ratios and helps you choose the right encoder.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is lost, a lossless audio format is required. in addition to FLAC, there are also others such as' shorten 'or' monkey 'that may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among audio formats that lose information by data compression depending on your psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG today may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but above this bit rate the differences become less important, since both encoders produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'Not so 'free, lame is still supplied with most distributions for free, but there are open license issues</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high to very high sound quality (at high bit rates), but compared with OGG slightly lower quality at lower bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG playback devices is present.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD players, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard disk) or special auto stereo systems. today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices mostly only support MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters for audio quality and the resulting compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for more parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standards' = This setting should usually provide acceptable transparency for most people and most of the music pieces, and has quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. requires up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. always needs 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems of high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h' = 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression ratio approximately 11. 128 kbps for all pieces of a song. good enough for music of youths, portable devices and autosteroids. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be overdone for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want to have absolutely highest quality without regard to file size, then choose this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information that is entered manually or automatically fetched from the freedb via the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can hand over / use with & kaudiocreator; and the encoding program to generate the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with encoding programs, there is often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the encoding guidelines explain the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example to add the & CD title to the keywords (English: tag) if MP3s are encoded with lame, the switch -tt of lame and title parameters of & kaudiocreator; added. the result looks like this: '-tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiocreator; parameters that can be used (= button name in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freedb is: a free database, in which people can read the audio CDs, the information to upload / enter, so that all the others can download this information instead of entering the machine. it is to be noted that here only text is spoken: & CD; Title, Artist, Names of Pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (note of the translation) is not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent you from using the CD; more or less worthless, so neither the artist nor the music company can be harmed. anyway, neither the artist nor the music company can be harmed. anyway, any information can be obtained from a bumblebee by a & CD; business, physical or virtual.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiocreator; is active to select a check box (sending an address). for the use of freedb it may be used with another (fake) address as the system furnished in the system. in this type of configuration, it appears, the e-mail address when retrieving the data from the server is not used (This can only know the programmer who has checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudiocreator; set to use freedb, the geographically closest mirror server is to be used. this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the hosts.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit at freedb.org gives a current list of mirror servers for online retrieval of & CD; information during reading a & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which reading program is used to store pieces from CD; in wav files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumors that cdparanoia is used; those who want to know more specifically, look for the source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD; s. to note is that the cdparanoia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To save the read wav files, the encoders and thus the desired file format can be selected. in the first opening are predefined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (Oggs) and FLAC (a lossless compression for audio data) on the tab for setting up the encoder. other encoders can be added on this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Kodiers package must be installed by the Linux distribution in question before the encoder can be used. this is also required for the predefined encoder. more information about encoders can be found in the chapter Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a encoder, you can get more information about its switches by entering a command like lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console). 'lame' needs to be replaced by the name of the encoder.</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, the write and read real on it and whether both cdparanoia and the audio codiers of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for Oggs, flac & etc;) are installed. try to invoke both programs with a command line in a terminal. this could give an indication of what is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you don't want a copy protected audio CD; check out the shell of the CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step by step example. even if you are using other settings, this can give tips on how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, understand everything, but are somehow still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, set up everything and our first & CD; read. we will use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3V1 stitches (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">You must have cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be found as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. for example, a suitable package for lame can be found with a search engine, as it is considered not completely free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have write permission on it (eg; by trying to copy something into the konqueror).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section deals with the basic set-up of & kaudiocreator; something that is supposed to be done only once, and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes how to read a & CD; what needs to be repeated for each read & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the encoding of the music (lame) as well as the resulting audio quality (MP3) as well as the resulting audio quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps). since we are lazy, we share the program with the freedb to use the CD; data from the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not change them at every reading of a & CD; change once the appropriate settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is passed to the readout program so it can read the & CD; -Data / pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Frequently, / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your drive. if this does not work or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive is present, the effective device name can also be specified. if you can access the drive with other programs, then a look at the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the existing entries of the device designations for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The card chart General Settings. here is not much to do. here, an additional conversion can be defined. in our example, everything is left / entered as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only in case of incomplete information is selected, so that you will be informed if information on creating keywords (tags) is missing.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card chart CD; -Settings. simply select both entries. we are comfortable and let the & CD; data automatically download via the Internet from a freedb calculator.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer must be connected to the Internet during read-out of the & CD so that it can access the freedb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection field is easier, a & CD; found entry, immediately begins reading the & CD;. this is associated with low risk, if you are later dissatisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / filenames or tag entries, they can be easily changed. the directory / file name will be changed with Konqueror- &gt; rename and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde; Tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, keep in mind: if you want to enter everything manually, disable the selection fields and freedb will not be used. you can use freedb locally in offline mode when you download the database before. however, if you use freedb in offline mode, the two selections must be selected, at least the first. the mode is set up on the following card card.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is freedb for us. these are settings for the data request, for calling & CD; information from the freedb server over the Internet. how does the system know which data is to get the CD? read the section about freedb. set everything as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we have not downloaded the database, we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB-Server: please go to the freedb.org site and look for a mirror server near you. on this way, the load is distributed between the hosts. however, this setting will work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work equally as far as the server is concerned, as many firewalls boot the protocol 8880 by default, there may be more luck with the protocol 80, as the & HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we do not want to send data to the freedb server. deactivating the first check box should be enough.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Just take the settings from the screenshot. (make sure the / tmp directory exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneous pieces: sorry, there is one reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive? parallel reading and encoding? the author does not know, therefore simply try yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; after reading the last piece, check this to the & CD; discard at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">Custom folder for temporary files: if you tick this, then / must specify the path / folder in which the WAV files are stored. if the field is not checked, the files are created in the private folder. do not forget this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Enter everything as it is on the screen shot. the command is a bit long, under certain circumstances something has to be browsed to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of the MP3s. as mentioned earlier, this is a setting for very good audio quality, even for very good hi-fi stereo systems. the resulting bitrate is approx. 224 to 256 kpbs. the resulting compression ratio is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' to restrict the creation of tags to version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2 tags can also be deleted as needed. Kid3 is an excellent' id3 'tagger for & kde; in case of a later change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Set the rest as shown in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside this example:</seg>

<seg id="1573">That's it, we just finished the basic set up of & kaudiocreator; this configuration is used as standard for each reading of a & CD; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music wisely, you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section we describe how the process of reading the & CD; running on the hard drive. we will create MP3 files. the folder structure, the way the music on the hard drive is organized, has been set up in the previous section, as we are comfortable and the & CD; data from the freedb is described.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a & CD; use that is not yet contained in freedb, the screenshots look a little different from that for a & CD; with successfully obtained data collected from freedb. therefore, you will learn the & CD; data manually, instead of fetching them from the Internet. comments will point to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Try not to find the & CD; this example is a 'special' edition of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not yet done, now the & CD must be inserted into the drive that has been defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment, the pieces and their length should be listed in the window, as in the screenshot. this only if the & CD; can be identified as audio CD; can be identified and read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this does not happen then look for help in the section Questions and Answers or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the CD has been successfully picked up by the freedb, all titles of the pieces are already completed and the name of the artist and the album will be shown.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; -Key for your & CD; there, a window appears, and you can select the database entry that best fits your opinion to your & CD; fits.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you have not selected the check box for the automatic query of freedb (on page & CD; settings in the dialog for Settings), you can also manually trigger this by selecting the first button in the toolbar. if you do not have a local database, but fetch the data from the Internet, you need the connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 step 02: the CD Editor - input of the CD-data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; according to the pattern on the next screen shot. the title of the piece in the first line of the input field 'Current Title', the rest of the data in the input field 'Album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist no longer has to be entered in the input field 'Current Title' unless you have a compilation of different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The bottom comment field can be used for individual comments, the comment field on the album is used for comments that apply to all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful retrieval of the data from the freedb the CD editor is not empty, but it already contains the data as shown in the screenshot. however, it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name (e.g. if all words start with capital letters or not...), but also to check if there are any unwanted comments.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we only use ID3v1 tags. this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the commentary box. if you use ID3v2 tags, you have unlimited field length, at least on what & kaudiocreator; maximum allowed. this option is set up on the encoding settings tab; take a look at the section 'Basic Settings'.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of generated files later with tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also recreate ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all encoding and file formats. see the help of the encoder to get more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry that obviously matches the style of the suffesent CD; in this example, this is not important as we do not transmit the & CD data anyway. for more information go to the website of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or rap for example are to be found under rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">"" "after choosing" "" "OK" "" "you come back to the main window. simply click on the line with the second piece." ""</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD Editor appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data we recorded for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece. simply enter the title of the piece and other information you want.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the & CD; entered.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window does not appear when you have downloaded the data from the freedb. it is already sorted in one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button on the toolbar. note that the artist and the album are displayed above the parts list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check mark in front of each line of a piece. only the tracks marked as such will be read out. a simple click on the row will switch off the selection of the piece, or press the All items button at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">When selecting the selection process by clicking on the selection button, this window will appear for confirmation. click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the entries and follow what is going on.</seg>
<seg id="1599">On the tab orders to switch to the order window. it is located in the left upper half of the window, directly below the toolbar buttons.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to control the orders. the first piece is currently being read on the hard disk. the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar.</seg>
<seg id="1601">You see this error message if you try to work with a encoder you have not yet installed. pieces that have not been successfully decoded are marked with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and the destination folder are not what we have typed here in the example. did you check if you have write access to the folder for the temporary files and the destination folder?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of reading the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: assignment 4 is the encoding of part 1 into the format MP3. thus, read out and encoding in parallel. note the status message in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has not found a configuration setting to suppress this behavior. the only thing that seems to be configurable is the number of parallel processes to read and code. the used calculator with an AMD64 does not seem to have a problem with simultaneous reading and encoding (of two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read out while another piece is encoded and a third order is encoded in the queue of the encoder. after the last piece is encoded, a small window is displayed with a message for a short time in the upper left corner of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & kaudiocreator;, you need & kde; 3.x. or 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG, you need the encoder of your choice.</seg>

<seg id="1609">This section is intended for people who compile from source files, and not for users who use a pre-compiled package of their distribution.</seg>
<seg id="1610">If you are looking for help as the program can be adapted to your needs once it is running, then the following is right for you:</seg>
<seg id="1611">A program that calls up many different programs has many variants of settings. best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings. it shows screenshots of the different mapping cards of the settings and also includes comments for options that are not used in the example.</seg>
<seg id="1612">Hello, still reading? even if only the help menu was clicked after the initial start of the program, without any clue as it should go on from this somehow empty screen (especially if there is no audio CD; in the drive), or from the unusually short menu?</seg>
<seg id="1613">What is it all about? who is reading this, probably already started the program. it should look like this:</seg>
<seg id="1614">A bad example: unfortunately no e-mail. the author cannot maintain this manual. it is intended as the first version for a manual to & kaudiocreator; may it do. at least after contact with the author. and if you read this, he left this section and therefore agrees with this proposal.</seg>

<seg id="1616">& kmid; is the MIDI- and karaoke player from & kde; besides others, it also features some properties that other & UNIX; -MIDI players do not have with real-time graphics and karaoke real-time highlighting.</seg>
<seg id="1617">& kmid; runs under & Linux; and FreeBSD. it builds on the OSS system, so it should work on all systems with OSS and & kde; support too. & kmid; also supports the & Linux; Ultrasound project driver needed for CIS cards. ALSA is included as soon as it supports a sequencer.</seg>
<seg id="1618">& kmid; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color, making it easy to follow the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1619">Graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by highlighting the pressed keys on the (virtual) keyboard.</seg>
<seg id="1620">Drag & drop so you can drag & drop; any MIDI file from one & konqueror; -windows can drag on kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Supports the two existing standards to store text in MIDI files (properties or text events).</seg>
<seg id="1622">When you stop & kde; when you play a song, kmid will start with the same song next time.</seg>
<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI synthesizers, AWE, FM and GUS cards (for the latter you need the LUP driver and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First, you can select Open... from the File menu. it appears the usual file dialog with which help you can select the song you want.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also drop a file from a & konqueror; -windows to the & kmid window. this also works with several songs at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and press the Play button in the toolbar, select the item Playing from the menu item, or press the space bar.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; a piece automatically starts as soon as you drag it to the & kmid; (for several pieces you will be added to a collection and then played successively.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">As soon as & kmid, play a piece, you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and going back and forth with the regulator.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song is played too fast or too slowly, you can click the arrows at the left and right of the tempo display and change the playback speed. to get back the original tempo, double click on the Tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The space bar has two tasks: when a piece is played, a pressure affects the space bar like a pressure on the button pause or selecting the menu item pause in the menu item, thus interrupts the play. press the space bar while no play is played, starts & kmid; playback.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be stored in two ways in one piece of music. some pieces use text event, others use lyrics auction and others both. some pieces do not have any text: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & Kmid; you can set which events are to be displayed and even better: the event type is automatically ascertained, which uses a song so you don't have to manually set anything manually. so, if you select the Automatical Text option in the Settings menu, you will automatically select the karaoke text. however, you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to specify an event type, select the text events or song events from the Settings menu. the same function also has the 1 and 2 keys.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files that you summarize. these are played back in series. in this section you will see how you can efficiently use collections.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collection manager. you will find it in the menu Collection under the item Organize.... Click here on New and enter the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on the copy and specifying the name for the new collection. at the beginning, this collection will contain the same songs as the original.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can set the desired items in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">The temporary collection includes all the songs you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When you leave the application, this collection is not saved. remember that when you add a lot of pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, you have to be selected in the collection manager. there you can add a song with the Add button. it again appears the file dialog with which help you can select the song you want.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on setting Automatic Add to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When automatic Add to the collection is enabled, a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening (using File Open or Drag & Drop).</seg>
<seg id="1643">When automatic addition to the collection is not activated, the temporary collection is activated and emptied when opening a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you need to open the collection manager, select the collection and the song you want and then click Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are played. if you select the sequence from the pop-up menu of the menu collections, the songs will be played in the order as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu, the order is redefined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the select list above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To skip a song, select the Next song button, next song next song from the menu item or press the arrow on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To jump back a song, select the button Prey piece, the entry Predictive piece from the menu item or press the arrow on the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection to be deleted and click the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, this does not matter, since it is not saved when leaving & Kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizers which are not general MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI map translates general MIDI events into events that the synthesizer understands.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map that converts all events of Change Herpatch to Bright Piano in events of the Change Herpatch to Trumpet type and therefore always lets you sound a trumpet if you originally had to play a piano.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you only have one sound card, you don't need MIDI map, because all sound cards are GM-compatible (incl. Awe - and GUS cards, FM devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There are unfortunately no programs to create MIDI maps, so you have to edit the corresponding file by hand (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI map is a text file that stores all required implementations for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may appear only once, except the keymap section that may appear as often as desired. however, there is a prerequisite for each occurrence to have a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define keymap "Name of Keymap"... END Define keymap "Another Keymap"... END Define CHANNELMAP... END OPTIONS... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that Define is needed to indicate that a section starts (except for OPTIONS) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as email so that I can provide support in future versions of & kmid; support for devices that are not general MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section you will see how the patches of General MIDI are mapped to your specific keyboard. general use looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM-patches are in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you may not change the order and also leave no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M is used to lay all the sounds that this instrument needs to sound with the number M. if your keyboard does not support a gun (GM-Patch 127), you can use a drum (e.g. with sound 60) which sounds similar to a gun. add the following in the PATCHMAP segment:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if a MIDI file is to play a note with Patch 127 (the drum on your keyboard) it plays the sound 60, no matter what sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here with the term drum-patch the patch is meant where each note represents another percussion instrument (drum, cymbal, maracas & etc;) and not the one where the sound means the pitch of the always same drum (as some keyboards have).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The keymap section is used to specify how sounds are mapped on a particular channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of the lines is very important, as well as their presence. so you have to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several key maps for each channel and each instrument. you just need to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are mainly used to map sounds on the percussions channel. see the provided Keymaps as an example.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to map several channels to others. for example, if you want to swap the first and second channel, make it easy to use in the CHANNELMAP segment.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are more useful for keyboards which have the percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI on Channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel that is represented on the channel N. if you use the Keymap option, the keymap with the name name is needed for this channel. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored, which attempt to change the patch on this channel. in this case, the patch is always used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful, for example, to always use the percussions patch on the percussions channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">PitchBenderRatio evaluates the value of Pitch Bender events. if a MIDI file sends a pitch-Bender event with the value n, it is converted with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then redirected. the value 4096 is used to avoid decimal decimal in the map file.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM suggests that a keyboard that gets a pitch-Bender event will play a ton higher with the value 4096. unfortunately, some keyboards try to play two sounds up to one octave higher. to find the right value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI map, simply open the MIDI Settings dialog. this can be found in the Settings menu, item MIDI Settings.</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a full range of keyboards (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboards you can see which sounds are played right now.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel, there is a selection list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the button lights no more green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view (until now) has two different views to display the played sounds. in the Settings menu, select Settings under the point channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The speed LCD displays the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">So if you find a song too fast to follow the lyrics, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music. it contains the notes, rhythm, speed, & etc; this allows the same MIDI file to perform on two different devices to very different results, just as two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Well, I can't force anyone to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 Kb, while an mp3-file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you get a similar sound quality. in addition to a MIDI file, you can also change the individual instruments, the speed & etc; you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) by & kmid; this happens because & kmid; compiled without AWE support. to fix the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (for example by kmid; 's home page)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I do not want to add all files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">OK, support & kmid; drag & drop. just open the folder you want to add in & konqueror;, select all the files and drag them to the & kmid; window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">By default, enable automatic addition to the collection. otherwise, the files will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can press the arrow key on the left of the Tempo- LCD to slow playback. to restore the default tempo, double-click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have on a & kde; Desktop an & konqueror; -windows with my MIDI folder and & kmid; on this desktop (when I play a MIDI file) or attached (if I play a karaoke file) or attached (if I want to play a karaoke file), I only need to switch to the & konqueror; -window and drag the desired file into the & kmid window.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you want to listen to a file quickly without adding it to a collection, turn off the automatic addition to the collection, and the new; file will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1692">Suppose you have the MIDI files A.M., B.mid and C.midi. first, you just want to play the first file. so, set the setting Automatically add to the collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection then contains exactly this a MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then you decide to play B.mid and C.mid and create a collection of all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people have sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! when I hear these songs or see the postcard, this encourages me to write on & kmid; to program.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; from Maacute; Malaga (Spain). I'm studying mathematics at the University of Maacute; I'm studying mathematics at the University of Maacute; I'm still trying to take a bit of time for my hobbies, but I'm trying to take a bit of time for my hobbies, but I try to collect MIDI files, make music and prove sentences.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where to download MIDI / Karaoke files, if you have a question, an error or an idea for an extension of & kmid; or, if you want to make me happy, write me an email: larrosa @ kde.org or antechr @ armisis.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">If you send me a postcard from your place of residence or a MIDI- / Karaoke file from a local group, if you send me a postcard or a MIDI file, you should contact me, as I might already have the file.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I have written & kmid; completely written in my spare time and given no money to anyone. I would like to point out that I only use it further because / when I get feedback from users (postcards or emails).</seg>

<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend you a sound card or an external synthesizer because the sound quality depends much on your sound card. it is not the same whether you use a FM or AWE card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you don't have a sound card, you must compile & kmid; compile with MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL. it then runs as if you had a sound card except that you cannot hear music naturally.</seg>

<seg id="1706">& KMPlayer; is a simple user interface for MPlayer, Phono and ffmpeg. the program is used to play video files of formats supported by MPlayer or Phonon, as well as playback of DVD s, VCD s or TV and camera.</seg>
<seg id="1707">The documentation for & cappname; was not yet finished as & kde; installed on this computer.</seg>
<seg id="1708">For additional help please check the page The KDE website for new versions, or send the question to The & kde; send user mailing list.</seg>
<seg id="1709">The application window is made of so-called andockable windows. there is always the window with the central view. optionally, there is the window with the playlist. and finally there is an information window that will only be displayed when information is returned.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to save the preferred connections under the menu bookmark, but these are single entries. if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other, you should use the category permanent playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy level. if you select an entry, its group and all its subgroups will be copied to the current category and the playback starts with the associated entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' Current play ', TV and permanent playlist can also be changed by editing the XML configuration files. of course, you can only do that if & SMB; not running. the different files in the directory ~ / .kde / share / apps / SMB players /, can be modified by an editor, but also by the application itself. to do this simply click on a name of a category, then select from the View menu and next edit mode. by clicking on a subgroup, only the XML content of this part is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, you must select a playlist from the menu and select Edit Mode, or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes will be lost if the editing mode is left or another group will be selected without the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">As a result of the convenience of the author of & KMPlayers; some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files..</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation when starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc and changing [General Options] No Intro = 0 above option to '1'. if the option is not present, it can be inserted easily.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate another animation. & KMPlayer; note the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / intro.xml and ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / exit.xml. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation during startup doesn't need to be short, it is automatically finished by opening another source. however, this would be disturbing at the end animation, the user can therefore finish the application a second time.</seg>

<seg id="1720">There is a tab for configuring MPlayer in the configuration dialog of & KMPlayers; here you can set the path from the MPlayer and the intermediate storage size of the data stream from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for troubleshooting is the button 'Console' in the toolbar of KMPlayers. here is the output of mplayer.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no rider for this playback device in the configuration dialog of & KMPlayers; everything needs to be configured by manual editing of the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc, just like setting up the backend by mimetype. here is an example of how a flash movie is played with the swf dec mozilla module:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played within & KMPlayers; it can even be played into the special field embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>

<seg id="1726">To ensure that a given backend is taken for a specific mime type (of course only if this is also determined), it must be done by manually changing the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc. for example, Phonon should play all ogg files:</seg>

<seg id="1728">To configure the VDR (Video Data Recorder) settings in the KMPlayer dialog in the settings under - &gt; Quelle- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo Port should be used. there should be detected ports of which one is selected. the encoding must be found (eg. it is PAL for West Europe), the correct name probably has a dvb in it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support of KMPlayers can only use XVideo, XVideo should also work (presumably this type of playing video devices under Linux is the only one working). for this reason, the video forlinux extension for the X server must be functional. for the XFree86 server, the following must be included in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config):</seg>

<seg id="1742">Latex;: a professional typesetting application. under Unix-like systems it is likely to rely on the package & texlive; or & tetex; (for older systems).</seg>
<seg id="1743">Most of these components can be included in the used & Linux distribution. for the installation, the documentation of the distribution or installation CD; / DVD should be used.</seg>
<seg id="1744">The & Kile; Project includes some already compiled packages from & Kile; for various distributions. these enable easy installation without further compiling and are included on the box; -website.</seg>
<seg id="1745">This manual is for everyone - regardless of their experiences with & latex;, & kde;, & Kile; or & Linux;.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Advanced users probably hardly have to read this manual. however, all suggestions for documentation are taken into account. if the support for this project or its documentation is desired, the contact via the box should be made.</seg>
<seg id="1747">If you have questions to or compile from & Kile; or if extensions are requested, this should be addressed to the mailing list Kile-devel @ lists.sourceforge.net.</seg>
<seg id="1748">& Kile; is an integrated & latex; environment for the & kde; -desktop. & Kile; provides the possibility to use all & latex; functions in a graphical interface and within this a simple, immediate and tailor-made access to all & latex programs. furthermore, the easy to use wizard, the & latex; -reference and powerful project management need to be called.</seg>
<seg id="1749">To learn more about & kate; and to learn its possibilities the manual to Kate should be consulted. users of & Kile; can start there directly with reading the chapter works with the editor of & kate.</seg>
<seg id="1750">For & latex; is the correct pronunciation: Lay-TECH. while the original & tex; difficult to use, also a layman (lay) & latex; -macros may also use. a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it comes from the surname of Leslie La mport.</seg>
<seg id="1751">If only a good view to latex is given, it is not the ultimate book for it. to be able to master correctly, good books such as H. Kopka / P. W. Daly, A Guide to & latex;: document Preparation for Beginners and Advanced Users, 3rd Edition, 1999 should be used.</seg>
<seg id="1752">Just as other markup languages includes & latex; an introduction with which the general properties such as paper format, page numbering and text size are defined as well as a body with the text. the introduction contains at least the command\\ 'begin {document} and must be closed again with the command\\ end {document}.</seg>
<seg id="1753">The Quick Climbing Wizard of & Kile; is a useful feature for quick creation of a document in & Kile; selecting the wizard (MenÃ ¼) provides some possibilities for creating the document. there may also be some settings related to the document.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Document classes: this defines the type of document to be created: article (article), book [book], letter [letter], report [report], article (DIN) [scrreprt], book (DIN) [scrartcl], book (DIN) [scrartcl], book (DIN) [scrartcl], book (DIN) [scrartcl], Projector [beamer], slides [Prosper] or Custom.</seg>
<seg id="1755">Encoding: this is used to set the encoding of the system. modern systems are increasingly using the UTF-8 encoding as standard. at best UTF-8X should be used (for correct processing of latex; documents).</seg>
<seg id="1756">This list contains the most commonly used auxiliary packages for latex; for the integration they only need to be selected in the check box.</seg>
<seg id="1757">Article (DIN), book (DIN), letter (DIN): the document classes of Koma-Script (to comply with German DIN regulations).</seg>
<seg id="1758">New users now don't have to worry about it. these are just a brief description of the functions and further information is given in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1759">& Kile; provides - just like other source editors - the highlighting of the commands, settings and elements (as well as the inappropriate). by & Kile; if you notice greater areas of a green text on the screen, it is very probable that some mathematical environment is not closed. however, it will save you through the modest appearance of the output file. however, it is spared by the highlighting time and prudent.</seg>
<seg id="1760">Automatic execution of the settings will automatically create a new command (e.g.\\ begin {command}) from & Kile; automatically generates a blank line (e.g.\\ end {command}) and the corresponding line to the scheduler of the command (e.g.\\ end {command}). this function can be disabled in the menu settings box; set up LaTeX commands.</seg>
<seg id="1761">All documents are usually subdivided into some elements. & latex; allows dividing the document into the following elements (apart is the highest and sub-paragraph the lowest element):</seg>
<seg id="1762">In view of the document in the structure view, the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a click of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="1763">When creating your own & latex; files can be very helpful when searching for a DVI file; a click with the middle mouse button on the DVI; -viewer to the corresponding row in & latex; -source code.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI; file contains a description of the formatted document and also other information such as the font and is besides PDF the output type of & tex; or & latex; there are many tools for viewing, converting and printing DVI; -files for different systems and devices.</seg>
<seg id="1765">When the search box is used, the elements of the DVI; file are connected to the editor and as soon as one element was clicked into the DVI; file, the corresponding part is bound in the & latex; source text was clicked to the corresponding location in the DVI; -viewer.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master document: this function is used when working with multiple files. with a master document, working with other included .tex files is simplified. when using a project, a project-wide master document can be set over project project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Quick construction: the & latex; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed (unless there are any errors in the source code).</seg>
<seg id="1768">File monitoring: in this mode, the DVI file is to be awakened to mouthguard units. and there is no call from & eyepiece; after the quick construction.</seg>
<seg id="1769">When viewing the Edit toolbar, the three large selections should be highlighted. the selection fields have been developed for quick incorporation of common elements into the document. the first selection field is for quick breakdown of the document into parts, chapters, sections... The available & latex; -commands for subdivision are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The Other is available for selection of items such as keywords, notes or references. the options available are:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: with this command a name for a section, a picture, or other item is created.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Reference: used for reference to a specified term (selection via a selection box possible).</seg>
<seg id="1773">When using quote, a selection list is displayed with literary entries. at & bibtex; this only works if the file belongs to a project. for editing & bibtex; files are appropriate editors. the author has good experiences with & kbibtex; and & kbib;. the & bibtex; files can also be written in & Kile; by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last drop-down box with the name GrÃ ¶ ter e is used for defining the font sizes e. the letters can be set for the main text, the notes, etc. there are the following letters for reference:</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & kile, there are two choices available: 1. the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the type of document and maintaining the settings. 2. the document can be written from scratch using the hand.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The brackets after the command\\ 'documentclass contain the settings for the command. the setting [12pt] specifies the size of the font. if the font size is not set at the beginning, this can also be done in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the above source code example has been entered, the & latex; source code must be compiled. the easiest way to do this is to use the menu Build or button quick construction.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be saved before compiling. & Kile; stores the storage automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1779">If the document is not compiling, it should be searched for errors in logging. when using Quick-Lock & Ocular; it should be started automatically. if this is not the case, the logging process should also be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment (environment) is a text, which is treated differently from the rest of the document. for example, a report with the font guide e 12 is created, and only a few columns should have a different font. the command\\ begin {environment},\\ Huge and\\ end {environment} allows for example a modification of the font size e within the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The changes are considered only within the environment (by\\ begin} environment} to\\ end {environment}. there is no restrictions (number) for the changes within an environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many possibilities to answer the document's readability and ease of use. for example, certain fonts, fat printing, italics, submissions, etc. can be added. these commands end either with the command\\ end or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {emph}: this command is for italics and is active as long as it is closed with a\\ end {emph} or another environment. a single word in a set can be represented italic with\\ emph {word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ quote: creates a quote in the document. the quote begins with\\ begin {rate} and ends with\\ end {quota}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Following the background to write the source text with the & latex; markup language, now follows a step-by-step guide for creating a document in & quot;.</seg>
<seg id="1786">As soon as a bit of text was entered in the wizard, some adjustments should be made for the better readability of the document. at least one quote, a few passages in bold and italics, and a poem can be used to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, it can be returned to the editor by using the Editor View or Ctrl E (for internal viewers).</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI file is created, the document can be printed or converted to a & PostScript; / PDF file. simply try and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is an independent file format (engl. D e V ice I natively). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for the readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi output such as printers, & PostScript; / PDF converter or computer screens.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For printing a & DVI file, the same steps as for the creation of the document are necessary (see). at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - the document can then be printed using File Print (in the viewer) (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar allows the conversion of the DVI; file to other formats. once the DVI file is made of the & latex; source code, the conversion can start in desired other formats using the buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The search function allows the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position within the DVI file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& Kile; provides a corresponding setting for all and latex; binding files. for this only Modern under Settings box must be set up... Tools building should be selected.</seg>
<seg id="1794">To perform the search function, the mouse pointer must be positioned in a row of the source text and subsequently be clicked on the search box. the jump to the corresponding location in the DVI; viewer is then carried out.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & Oct.; with a click of the middle mouse button in DVI; -document the corresponding and latex; -document from & Kile; open and speckled to the respective row. for this you have to define & Kile; in & Oct.; set as text editor (Setting Settings... Editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">If there is no error when using the & DVI; -viewer, an error may be present. if there is an error, it will be displayed in the logging file or in the message window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The log file causes the source of error in the source code. in the editor, the causes Previous LaTeX errors and NÃ ¤chster LaTeX errors can be used between errors. the logging file always specifies the line in which the error appears. in order to view the error line, the error in logging must be clicked and & Kile; jump to the wrong line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Once you click on the corresponding button on the toolbar, a window will appear to select the template you want to use for the document. the default options are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When choosing empty documents, a document can either be rewritten from scratch or used to quickly create a new document. more information can be found in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Hands-free users of & latex; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents. templates can be created in & Kile; created, saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / latex; file must be opened or a new file will be created. & Kile; can create a new template by opening an existing document and selecting file template from document... Create.</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a template using File New, some strings are replaced by other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables can be set in Settings box...</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template, it is therefore necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is replaced by entering into document class. typically, it is used as follows:\\ 'documentclass [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {Item}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The easiest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor. once the document has been created this way, the following steps must be performed:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, your own template can then be selected instead of the default ones.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any and latex; files can be created. if an easy way to create a template is required, you should search for a template found on the Internet and the steps described below.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& Kate; used & kate; as an internal editor. & kate; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and highlighting of many different types of text files (including and latex; and & bibtex;). many settings for & kate; can be done in the Tools directly from & Kile; out.</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more about & kate; and its options should be consulted from the manual to Kate. users of & Kile; can start there directly with reading the chapter works with the editor of & kate; begin.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& Kile; provides a very practical & latex; command reference that can be called over the Mention Help LaTeX reference. it contains an exceptional description of almost all commands which can be found in & latex; use as well as their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Double-click with the pressing Ctrl key to select the & tex; this means that by clicking on\\ par of\\ par\\ bigskip only\\ par is selected.</seg>
<seg id="1812">When dragging the text with pressed left mouse button, the selected text is automatically copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key, parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& Kile; has the possibility to search through different kinds of source texts and to emphasize them. for example, the & latex works; -commands from normal text and also mathematical formulas are highlighted by a different color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many assistants can add additional jumping nets. this is a separate type of bookmark within the text. the menu items do the jump to the next or last jump brand. this is also highlighted, so that it is automatically retrieved when the first character is entered.</seg>
<seg id="1816">The Edit is probably one of the main aspects of using a program like & Kile; although & kate; already offers excellent possibilities, have been added in & Kile; important functions for writing a & latex; -source text added. & latex; notified of many environments and groups and therefore support & tipping; special commands for their selection. under Edit Selection are the following commands for text selection included:</seg>
<seg id="1817">Heals a whole paragraph (group of lines which contain a blank line on both sides). this extended meaning does not include a text with continuous lines (like in other text editors). this extended meaning includes tables, & latex; commands and all other lines of the source text. the only exploiting thing in & Kile; is that the Abyssal is separated by two empty lines.</seg>
<seg id="1818">The word is selected under the current cursor position. this selection also has an extended meaning since this command also contains & latex; -commands with a restore passage (\\) and an additional star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">To delete a part of the document, this can be selected first and removed by pressing the Delete key. & kate; provides the key Ctrl; K with which the entire line is removed. & Kile; provides with its own commands for faster possibility. under Edit, the following commands are contained to read the text:</seg>
<seg id="1820">Removes a complete paragraph. the definition for a paragraph in & Kile; is contained in the description to edit select paragraph.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already been clarified that environments play a central role in & latex; therefore, & Kile; for further orders under Edit environment for a possible simple work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">With this command, jump to the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1823">With this command, jump to the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the command to lieutenant in the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor is before or within the command\\ begin {ambient}, jump to the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering many nested surrounding commands, the track view can be lost quickly. this command closes the last opened environment so that the nested surrounding structure is not destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& Kile; also offers special commands for the & latex; groups that are defined by braces {...}. under Edit TeX group are some important commands that correspond to those from the editing environment.</seg>
<seg id="1827">With this command, jump to the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the sharpened bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1828">With this command, jump to the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the welded clasp.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor appears before or behind the braces of a & tex; -group #, jump to the other end of the group (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">When entering many nested group brackets you can quickly lose track view over. this command closes the last opened group so that the nested structure of the & tex; groups will not be destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & latex; two simple quotes are used as a substitute. for the beneficial implementation it is used in & Kile; the sign is used for two simple quotes. & kile; knows this case and applies two closing quotes for latex; one.</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic application of double quotes can be set up under Settings box... LaTeX can be switched on and off.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Foreign specific settings (e.g. ngerman or engravings) can also be used, so that German or French suits can be used. there are also many other languages available.</seg>
<seg id="1834">Pressing Shift; Enter key for & box; an intelligent line break. if the current position is located within a list environment (e.g. enumerate or itemize), & Kile; not just a line break but at the same time the command\\ item.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Trace & dump in a table environment; the current line with\\\\ with a subsequent line break.</seg>
<seg id="1836">Even better - & Kile; is intelligent enough to support pre-set & latex; - or custom environments. these can be added under Settings box; set up... LaTeX.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Some users want to arrange the columns in spreadsheets and thereby all Et characters (amp;) among each other. & Kile; try to erase this. while holding Shift; Alt; amp; searches & Kile; after the next tabs in the adjacent line. even though this tabulator is not the added tabulator in the adjacent line.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Although & kate; already offers a good source code comprehension, it has been added in & Kile to include special commands (mostly for latex;). three of them work on demand and the other two are built for automatic comprehension. all these modes can be set up for different working modes in Settings box... complete.</seg>
<seg id="1839">At the start of a new environment using the command\\ begin {ambient}, & Kile; automatically add the command\\ end {environment} to an empty line (for the text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">When pressing the back-key, the last letter of the input is removed and it is possible to resize the complete list. on the other hand, the list can also be reduced by entering another letter.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a brief description of their parameters. alternatively, the descriptions can be removed from & Kile; alternatively, jumps can be inserted, so that a jump to these positions is possible by editing hock marks NÃ ¤th ankle and the desired parameters can then be entered.</seg>
<seg id="1842">Under Settings box; set up... boxes; all settings can be made to these lists. it can be used to choose different parts lists for & tex; - and & latex; -commands as well as the quivers of the general language use.</seg>
<seg id="1843">The command mode is not useful for the execution of environments. there are always a few letters to be entered with\\ begin and the call for complete mode will result in a large e-list with environment commands. on the other hand, the environments are so often used that & box; a special mode for the complete defense of environments.</seg>
<seg id="1844">When invoking the complete environment or key Alt + Shift key, the command to open the environment is automatically filled and it appears\\ begin {. after that, the environment can be continued in the simplest way and by pressing the input button.</seg>
<seg id="1845">Once this is complete, the environment is automatically closed again. once & Kile; recognizes that it is a list environment, even a first\\ item command is added.</seg>
<seg id="1846">Under Settings box; set up... boxes; all settings can be made to these lists. this mode uses the wish list of the complete protection mode for & tex; - and latex; -commands.</seg>
<seg id="1847">& Kile; support custom lists of header extensions which are instantly replaced by longer strings. the lists can be set up under Settings box... For example, the file example.cwl, in which for example the entry L =\\ LaTeX is included.</seg>
<seg id="1848">For example, if the letter L is entered and the word processing mode is initiated, or the key pressing Ctrl + Alt Space Bar, the letter L will be replaced by the string\\ LaTeX.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Great e wizards are not helpful for automatic resigning. however, it has been found that many offices are written more than once in a document. thus, & Kile; the completion for all already written documents.</seg>

<seg id="1934">The name and email entries are self-explanatory. nickname is the user's nickname and is used for unique identification.</seg>
<seg id="1935">One member can have multiple roles in the project, such as both team leaders and subproject leaders.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The user can select from the list of team members who he is. this happens by selecting the team member from the list and pressing the button Setze. the currently selected member (their identity) appears bold after you are: text.</seg>
<seg id="1937">Nicknames and the setting of your own identity are important with regard to messages and comments. see for further information on comments.</seg>
<seg id="1938">In addition to the overview of your team, there is another advantage by capturing the members of the team: it can be an event for information to the team leaders when something specific happens. see for further information.</seg>
<seg id="1939">Event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project. an example would be the recording of opening and closing of the project so that later can be seen how much someone worked on it, or sending a message when a file is backed up, or a script that plays a file into CVS as soon as it is added to the project & etc;</seg>

<seg id="1949">The behaviour of & quantaplus; regarding tags including car completion, can be modified.</seg>
<seg id="1950">Big / Kleinspelling of tags: large / lowercase of automatically inserted tags. normal upper / lowercase means the tags are inserted in such a way as they are described in the tagXML files.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Large / lowercase attributes: large / lowercase of automatically inserted attributes. normal upper / lowercase means the attributes are inserted in such a way as they are described in the tagXML files.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Optional tags: if checked, for tags for which the closing tag is optional, this will be added immediately after & gt; added.</seg>
<seg id="1953">Do not automatically close tags: as above for all other tags except for simple tags.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Update start and end-tag automatically: if enabled, the corresponding closing tag will be changed and vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Automatic setting of accent characters: controls the automatic conversion of accented characters into the corresponding encoding during typing.</seg>
<seg id="1956">MIME types: mimetypes for detection of different types of files. the default settings can be restored using the Default button.</seg>
<seg id="1957">Standard character encoding: the encoding of newly created or otherwise created files (where the encoding of the file can be skipped). this setting is then expelled from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD is not recognized. however, this setting is expelled from the same in the project features if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Create a backup copy: & quantaplus; create backup copies periodically so that during a power outage or crash at the next start of the program the document can be restored from this backup. this is not the same as saving the file. even for unsaved documents a backup is created regularly, according to the set time.</seg>
<seg id="1960">Preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editor area or in a separate view (or the documentation in a tab), which makes it possible to view the documentation, preview and source text at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1961">Reset the default window settings to the default when the user interface has passed through changing MDI modes and / or appending / appending views. it corresponds to the --resettag command line parameter.</seg>
<seg id="1962">The warning message field is used for controlling warnings from non-polling warnings.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The place to change the behavior of & VPL; it can set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchronization behavior of the VPL- and the source code view in divided mode.</seg>
<seg id="1964">Here the parser and the structure tree representing the figure of the parser nodes in the document can be set in details.</seg>
<seg id="1965">In the mouse click on the structure tree, it is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the Structure tree settings, the visibility of nodes in the tree can be adjusted automatically when editing and how deep in a change in the structure tree. empty nodes are the empty areas in the text, while empty groups are such where no element has been found in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The area for setting abbreviations (a type of templates) that will unfold when editing a larger text. abbreviations are divided into groups, each can be valid for multiple & DTEP; s can be valid for multiple & DTEP; this means there can be a valid group for PHP, in which the ifclause abbreviation is something else than in a group valid for Javascript.</seg>
<seg id="1968">The plug-ins can be administrated here. plug-ins are third-party node-applications, which can be reused by any part-enabled application, the most well-known & konqueror;. when inserting a plug-in, the following must be specified:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to the plugin if it is not in a standard such as $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Entry: this information will be passed to the plugin at startup, so it can open the current file, the corresponding folder (path of the current file) or the project folder.</seg>
<seg id="1971">Load the component in the read-only mode: check if the plugin refuses to load. only read-only parts usually refuse loading if this option is not selected.</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the plug-in: if this is enabled, then try & quantaplus; if the entered information is correct. then, if the plugin is not available at the moment, it will be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantaplus; from version 3.3, troubleshooting was completely new. support for the no longer necessary built-in & PHP; (3) Debugger was set, as well as support for the DBG debugger. instead, a debugger plugin concept was implemented that allows different implementations via plug-ins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently only one plugin is available, which adds support for the use of & gubed; inquantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="1975">The use of the debugger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable debugger plug-in in the project settings. with the Options button next to the debugger plug-in selector, the specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If a debugger is enabled for a project, some additional elements appear in the & quantaplus; -user interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view that displays the contents of monitored variables. usually appears in the left dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view in which all holding points are listed with line numbers and conditions. usually appears in the bottom dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view in which the output (as in HTML) of the debugger is shown. usually appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported functions of the debugger, everything or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">With this action, the connection to debugger, if required, is established, or it tells the plugin to listen to debugging requirements. this action is triggered by default when a project is opened that uses a debugger, so that in normal cases it does not have to be respected.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart to Debugging session Start the session. closes the connection to debugger or terminates the sounds according to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends an HTTP request to the server to send a debug request. this is equivalent to the use of a browser to view the current document. the output of this request is displayed in the Debugger edition view.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script and send information about the monitored variables and the current line. if this happens while the script is halted, execution continues. happens before a debug request has been started, the script starts with the request.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script without sending information to monitored variables and the current line number. if this happens while a script is halted, execution continues. if a debug request has been given, the execution starts as soon as a request is requested.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The debugger will execute the next statement in the script without entering the functions or include.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The debugger will execute the next statement in the script, and if possible, it will be corrected in functions and include.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Instructs the debugger to skip the statement and go to the next one as if there were not the current one.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Opens a dialog where a variable or expression can be entered, which is to be monitored. the monitored value appears in the variable view.</seg>
<seg id="1990">With this dialog you can enter a variable or set a new value of a variable.</seg>

<seg id="2017">All TagXML files must start with a & XML; -declaration: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be properly chained and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Whitespace do not affect anything, but pay attention to & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & lt; tooltip &gt;, & lt; whatsthis &gt;, and & lt; text &gt; will be replaced. this will not cause a rupture, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check the tag XML files, the tools dialog box at the top of the & quantaplus window is to start and check TagXML. a further dialog will appear with simple instructions to follow.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not available yet. currently, the check is performed only when loading the TagXML files in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2021">The following is an example of a family 1 tag XML file. this file describes the & lt; schema &gt; element from the & W3C; & XML; schema. the filename for this tag XML file should be schema.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2022">The following is an example of a working family 2 TagXML file. in this file, a & PHP; overload function is described. the filename of this tag XML file should be overload.tag.</seg>

<seg id="2024">The & descriptionrc; file is just as simple and there is an editor for it, accessible via DTD editing DTD settings. thus, diedescriptionrc; for a newly created & DTEP; should be created for a newly created & DTEP; should be created a simple & descriptionrc; with the following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[general] Version = User 1 for & quantaplus; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for each higher version. name = DTD. (- / / W3C; / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name will be used as a nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2026">An action can be set with settings actions... created. click New Action leads to the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">This action assigned shortcuts. by clicking the user-defined button, a keyboard shortcut can be assigned; with K1 the current keyboard shortcut can be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. a text can be entered in the detailed settings and when executing the action, this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful type of action. with the help of this action, external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited) that change the document or use as input (or parts of the document) can be started. examples from & quantaplus; even are the quick start dialog or the different See in... actions for (X) HTML DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir variable in command line such as sh% scriptdir / myScript.sh. In this way, svn: $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / scripts local script folder: $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / scripts in their path: $PATH There are other special variables that can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we are replaced with the URL of the current document. in case of a local document, file: / from the document name is removed.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: is replaced with PID of the current & quantaplus; only an instance runs, the text unique is added to the PID number. this is useful if DCOP is used to control & quantaplus; used by the external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, usually the filename of the current document, or the path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the methods listed above, a script can be entered by & quantaplus; in the input field input can be determined what is to be sent to the default input. options are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected area of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is usually only useful with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input, the output of the executed application can also be redirected. there are two types of output: normal output, written to the standard output; error messages are directed to the standard output. it can be specified what is to happen with the text written on the default output by setting the value to the output box output:</seg>
<seg id="2038">When there are many tags in the markup language, it is recommended to divide the tags in logical groups. it is necessary to create their own toolbar for each group. in the given case, it is not too many, so you can create a toolbar with the name of the markup.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a toolbar has been added, you need to add and configure actions.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are quite self-explanatory. press the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill in all required fields and add the tag to the appropriate toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete everything and, if the day has attributes and you plan their use, enable dialog "Edit Day" when available to allow an input when using the action.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is that an ugly symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? let's replace it before we have trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that better represents the action, we will use & kiconedit; choose from the & KMenu;, Graphics more programs (or where else it is located in your distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; uses 32x32 pixels by default, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit size.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created icon will not only help you remember what does the promotion, but also all other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to the fact that the day starts, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green it is usually considered useless, rigid, further interpreted), or should at least indicate a message to the user that clicking on this symbol will insert; startled; -Tag in the current document will be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol, it still has to be associated with the action. this is done via the menu with settings actions... (in & quantaplus;) and select the desired action. next to the text field is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder where the saved icon is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the Apply button and continue with other tags, so there are others, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some common & quantaplus; functions to the toolbar or it should be shared to a better overview by some separators into several groups. open the toolbar to set dialog on Settings toolbar. make sure the desired toolbar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I would like to select the separator (at the top left) for my toolbar. after selecting the element that is to be added to the toolbar, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the item to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I would like to have a quick way to preview the Konqueror. I will select it and add it to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the separator supports the grouping. someone who does not know my toolbar can believe that the & konqueror; -button is the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar has to be tested by tweaking all symbols to make sure everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">After new eXML does not exist, it will be created in the root folder, but your toolbars (s) should be stored in the right folder, but your toolbars (s) should be stored in the right folder. please adjust their descriptionrc so that their toolbars (s) will be loaded (s) when a file is opened by the corresponding type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable extension of & quantaplus; for the normal user it is possible to add documentation for the scripting language or the formatting language you like most. that's why this chapter describes how to create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before you start your own documentation, you might be able to check in & quantaplus; -Repository if someone has already done it for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to look for an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; -language. then you need to create the docrc file. we leave the first part to you, the second we will treat here.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE Configuration File [Tree] Doc dir = path, relative to this file, to the documentation HTML files e.g. php42 / # items in main index Top element = Your description for these documentation e.g. & PHP; 4.2 Documentation Section 1 = Section1.html Sec2.3 = Sec2.2.html Sec2.3 = Sec2.2.html &gt; tag 1 html tag 2 = tag2.html tag 3 = tag2.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, you can see now in the & PHP; documentation so something:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config File [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element element element = PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Contents, # Getting Started, # Language Reference Table of Contents = INx.html Getting Started = Introduction,... Basic syntax = language.basic-syntac.html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is subfolder in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the depth of chess (except through reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the table of contents is referenced directly to a file (and consequently at the top end of the tree view & mdash; folder is displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Whitespace do not affect anything, but pay attention to & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resource files will be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The content section is the area of the docrc file, which is used to create context sensitive help. for example, when writing a & PHP script, the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function is to be displayed. the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function would be displayed directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and the file connection lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of contextual elements that should be available (for & PHP; these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can easily save your docrc file to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / doc for local and global use. then create a folder (as you specified it in your docrc file) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation there.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that they are good and worth sharing, send your docrc files with a description of important information such as which documentation has been used to the & quantaplus; -Repository for use by the & quantaplus; -Repository. you will not be rich, but proud to have worked with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus; you are not alone. it is possible to share the scattered resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">Resources can be sent via email to friends, partners, or anyone else. in different places there is an email-send menu entry, such as DTD DTD package (DTEP) with email, toolbar menu of files and folders in the templates and in the script tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded into our main archive from where all other & quantaplus; -users can download them. the contributions are checked and only made available if our team considers them to be correct and useful for publication. to make a more detailed contribution, we recommend to sign the resources for which it needs a GPG / PGP key. thus, the source of resources is ensured, both for our team and for the later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading you will be asked for their passphrase for their private GPG key (the passphrase is not saved), or in the event that you have several keys, you can choose one. in the New resource dialog, the input fields must be filled (URL preview can remain empty) and clicking OK to start uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Upload can be uploaded from the DTD DTD package (DTEP), upload toolbar, and start from the context menu of files and folders in the template and script tree.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, before installation, explores & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and marking. in case of problems it warns and it can then be aborted. if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed, a message appears indicating the source of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work on XML languages currently not yet supported by & quantaplus; it is time consuming, because hundreds of tag files can be needed in tagXML format. there is the easiest way to convert DTD into a DTEP package automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD menu and converting a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description which is to be used. after that the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Destination directory name: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name to the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">Doctype Definitions line: the string that appears in! Doctype tag, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / loose.dtd</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of the DTEP after conversion: if enabled, brings & quantaplus; after converting the & descriptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus; there are some key concepts. to understand them and to draw full benefit from & quantaplus, one must first familiarize oneself with these fundamental concepts. this chapter tries to explain these concepts to them precisely without their understanding and quantaplus; little benefit.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus; the working area is divided into three areas: global, local and project-related. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for everyone who uses & quantaplus; everything that is marked as global is stored in the shared folder structure of & quantaplus; this allows the group of administrators to secure different toolbars, actions and patterns in the global tree that are then available to everyone in a multi-user environment on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user's directory, so that they can only use that user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are available only within a particular project. this can be anything from & CSS; patterns to toolbars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project. simply, this is the most limited size. all elements are placed in the folder tree of the project, which embodies the common use of special tools and samples from all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of several main areas: the editor window, the construction supervisors, the tabs with information and the toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the tab with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document, recharge, delete or upload the document, jump to a bookmark or run CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right-click in the editor pane will lead to a further context menu with regard to the edited document content, such as basic editing steps (cut / copy / paste), editing the text under the mouse-cursor, or opening the file, if the string is called a file under the mouse pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top of the editor window are the editors of the editor. currently, & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional is the standard for which a set of toolbars is shown. in the course of further expansion of & quantaplus, the toolbars are adapted to the new functions and associated user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of tool bars is really easy. if you want to insert a single day, e.g. & lt; paste into your document, then click on the icon that the tag represents. now you can paste the data for this just inserted tag. if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes (such as anchors), you can fill in a dialog with different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The installation views (QIT;) allow you to navigate in the information to & quantaplus; to navigate, open it and strip them. in the presentation with tabs available for files, project, sample templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation tree views.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool that & quantaplus; provides. this view displays all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by right clicking. actions such as adding, removing, uploading or deleting the files from the storage medium can be done using the contextual menu that appears.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another possibility of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website & etc.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories depending on what context they are used. the category depends on & quantaplus; the category depends on the & quantaplus; global templates are always available, local templates for the respective users and templates in projects can only be used in the project.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you can find information about the available scripting languages. clicking with the left mouse button will allow you to retrieve the available information about a script. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can access the available information to a script. by clicking the right mouse button, more functions are available, such as start, edit or email the script.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With this view, the internal structure of the active document is displayed. by clicking on an element the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element. by right-clicking on an element, a list of commands in relation to navigation and refresher of the tree opens.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears under the other tree views. with it, it can quickly change attributes and namespaces. the entry system aligned to the content allows the change of all available attributes with just a few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation on the web technology for your development. you can download pre-packed documentation for & quantaplus; from the quantaplus; 'documentation site, you can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project, project-specific documentation can be appended, edited and viewed.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus; two tabs at the bottom of the window, can be accessed via the useful information: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This tab displays information about each script running in Quanta. for example, the currently used DTD is displayed in the current document and all changes to the DTD.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This tab shows all errors in the markup of the current document. & quantaplus; -scripts, which are executed, give all error messages (as there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; toolbar buttons are extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they get the corresponding command. the chocolate side of the toolbar is the possibility to define your own commands as symbols in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a toolbar with EMail. & quantaplus; sends the toolbar as compressed Tar archive via & kmail;. if you receive a toolbar in an email, you can save and load them in & quantaplus; like any other tool!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the & quantaplus; files on your system. therefore, autoconf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, type. / configure --help. the options are simple to understand and not executed here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems starting & quantaplus, you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folder. also, you should make sure that is not an older version of & kde; 3 in PATH in front of her bin folder. the same goes for & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web development tool for KDE desktop. & quantaplus; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">While trying to create the best & HTML editor, developers of & quantaplus began to deal with an obvious idea: what if & quantaplus; a standalone, expandable markup language editor would? well, this would make it the absolute most powerful web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer confined to pure & HTML; limited, is & quantaplus; now well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarized: if you can define it in & XML; then, & quantaplus; for this the appropriate & IDE; be.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Well, to the above claim must be held that & quantaplus; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the whole & kde; developer community based. & quantaplus; follow, in good application of free software, the idea of why develop what someone else has developed? thanks to the & kde; scaffolding not only this is possible, but it allows users and developers to expand as they need it for their needs.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus; allows web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi-document interface (MDI;). this can dramatically increase productivity. by using self-knitted actions, scripts and toolbars, automation is almost every task possible. by using self-knitted actions, scripts and toolbars, automation can be increased almost every task. by using self-knitted actions, scripts and toolbars, automation can be expanded without having to memorize any script language syntax. (find more about it in.)</seg>
<seg id="2111">& Quanta; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it was designed for fast web development and was quickly expanded to a sophisticated editor with many powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& Quanta; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of & Quanta. the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">More detailed documentation is available with help: / Quanta (either this URL in & konqueror; enter, or khelpcenter help: / Quanta).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& Quanta; is currently being developed and supervised by Eric Laffoon Sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files that you have opened. this list changes every time you open a file that is not located on it, and the oldest entry is taken out.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code pieces and whole files as templates for later use. look in the section on templates. if you try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder, only one error is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Converts special characters to & HTML when inserting from the clipboard, so they display correctly and do not misunderstand them as formatting instructions.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Converts the text from the clipboard into & URL; -spelling which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in & URL; s. primarily to insert & URL; s used in the anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Switches the block selection to or off. this allows you to select text blocks using the & Shift key.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Go directly to a line number. this is very helpful when your PHP and PHP script prints error messages!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a kind of grep or sed with GUI and predefined expression to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message window or not. this is the window where you can see the display of the script actions and the debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Check and turn on the problem reporter at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window. the problem reporter is activated as soon as you switch to the structure tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the toolbar left from the main window. this column allows you to set bookmarks with a click of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu along with the entries Previous or Next, depending on the cursor location in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other open documents appear grouped in the menu according to the filename of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project from the hard drive. & quantaplus; -projects are stored with the file extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog for inserting files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory for new files that might be there. this allows you to copy graphics files into your project folder or subfolder and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Upload the files in your project to the server. the list of available transport methods depends on your version of & kde; and if you have downloaded more input / output modules (KIO slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings, such as & quantaplus; the project manages. in chapter & quantaplus; -projects you will find the details.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Loads a project toolbar. these are kept in project / toolbars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to save your toolbar. allows you to select the type of toolbar: local or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens a dialog to add a new toolbar. this only creates the name. actions must be saved by setting actions... Save operations by means of toolbar tool bars or you will be asked if you want to save the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removes a toolbar from the field of view. this does not delete them from the disk. if you haven't saved the toolbar, you'll be asked if you want to do that.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send your own toolbar to someone (perhaps to the & quantaplus; team so that the toolbar is present in the next release). the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as an attachment.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Enables uploading of tool bars to the main server, where everyone else can access it.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Load a & DTD; you or anyone else has made and convert to the & quantaplus; own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Load / refresh the entities from the & DTD; it makes sense if the entities from the & DTEP need to be refreshed without renewing the whole & DTEP; if this is global and a write permission is not present in the global KDE folder, the load fails.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags available in the currently loaded toolbar. if the standard (HTML;) toolbar is loaded, there is a submenu item in the Tags menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current day preferences dialog when there is one. this entry is always present in the Tags menu, followed by & DTD; -specific sub-menus.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Active or deactivates the intelligent insertion of tags. currently, this only works with (X) HTML DTDs. intelligent inserting means that & quantaplus; inserting using toolbar until this day contradicts the rules.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plug-in menu, the available plugins are listed under the above-mentioned menu items. click on it. click on an activated plug-in deactivates it.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Selects the syntax highlighting mode for the current file. the list of available highlighting schemes depends on the kate; -version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Choose the type of line end identifier. very useful when you know people using other OS platforms to develop. choose Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Checks the syntax of the current document using the selected & DTD; using the external application tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Immediate switching between the different types of user interface. by some limitations in the KDE libraries, switching can sometimes take time or cause unnice graphics. recommended is the card map mode, which is also the default setting, or the subwindow mode that corresponds to the display in & quantaplus; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu contains an entry for each open subwindow. selecting an entry will activate the corresponding subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Enables the status bar to be displayed at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window on or off.</seg>
<seg id="2150">Changes in this dialog will affect any application that uses the KHTML part, including the & konqueror; web browser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Defines the behavior of the editor window. in the documentation of & kate; find details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears where you can delete entries from the toolbar or add which ones and change the sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should generate a help in line with the mouse pointer environment, but is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantaplus; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed, but as with any open source project developers can always use help. if you want to support & quantaplus; development in financial form, you can find the way here.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should preferably be filled from top to bottom, since the entire directory structure for the rest of the project is completed automatically after filling the project name. all of these paths and author information fields can later be set using Shift; F7 Project Properties.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project, for example foo. when entering the name, file will be filled in automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaplus; project file. by default it has the name of the project in lowercase and without spaces with the extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can enter the server address of the machine to which you want to access, except you edit local data. either a name (hostname.exempl.de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you leave this field blank, the default settings of the selected protocol will be used. depending on the remote host configuration, an adjustment could be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder where the templates are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and custom templates. if a common collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder where the toolbars are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and toolbars by default. if a common collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to include files from the local filesystem to the project. multiple files or whole folders can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change. for server-side scripts (e.g., PHP,, Python, & etc;) you have to proceed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Checked if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be included. if a project is started from scratch, do not tick.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option, all files and folders within the main folder will be displayed and you can make an exact selection of goodies.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of the files in the main folder. you can select the desired files by hook or by removing the tick from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be changed in the menu with project project properties in the sub-window profiles, or modified using Shift; F7.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project assistant and are described in. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of file names (placeholders possible) that are ignored in project-related operations such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Additional option to top, also files that are listed in .cvsignore are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view loaded when the project is opened. you can read more about project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">This allows you to select the desired debugger. currently only gubed is supported. more information about gubed can be found in. the Debugger plugin can be set using the Options button.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the Profiles window, upload profiles (see in) can be set, as well as displaying a tree view for the content of the server for each profile by pointing an own tree view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the sub-window team configuration, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the event configuration window, you can turn on event actions and add, change or delete actions. event actions are executed when a pre-determined event occurs, such as the saving of a file. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, & quantaplus opens; the last project that was opened. this behavior cannot be influenced at present.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open another project, select Open Project... from the Project menu or the Save Project menu from the toolbar. the Open Project dialog is displayed and allows the selection of a project. projects have .webprj as extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">When & quantaplus; closed, the project file is saved automatically. you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving when & quantaplus; changed files. the same happens when you load a new project.</seg>

<seg id="2183">The password will be kept in the core memory and forgotten at the end of the program. this option is useful when frequent uploading of files is necessary and the rather insecure password on the disk cache option does not come into question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog when you change your mind before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus; many high-load profiles can be created and thus the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded to different servers. when editing or creating a profile, this dialog is displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the server name on which the files should be copied. either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for upload. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed kio slaves. at least, you should choose from & FTP;, file (local) and nfs.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for the transfer. normally this does not have to be changed except the network administrator does not run a service on the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your anxiety shaft this is either a time-saving function or a danger. use it at your discretion. the password is stored on the disk, so that it cannot be read, but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is only one set of files and toolbars. there can be many views in a project, i.e., by simply deporting the view, various files and toolbars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be saved, opened or deleted from the Project Toolbar menu or project toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus; with which one has the most to do. this not only helps increase productivity but also allows the adaptation of & quantaplus; to the own way of working.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As already mentioned above are toolbars in & quantaplus; best customisable using the toolbar. use and add differ. adding tool bars is discussed below in the section Add of Toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbar and the symbols on it can be set either by context menu (right click on the toolbar), in which the New Action, a New toolbar can be created, other actions such as toolbars can be removed, the toolbar can be changed, where specified, which actions should be visible on this or other toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (icon) on a toolbar, the entries will be removed and action labored, which are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbar and the actions on them can be set up in the menu with Settings toolbar... and specify actions.. are set.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are basically document skeletons, code cutlets and files for linking. & quantaplus; basically uses templates like a common filesystem with extended organization and interfaces. you can copy, shift or associate any existing directory into the template tree. templates have in & quantaplus; in about the limitations you imagine for the filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; provided templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary is everything that is not pure text. it can be any file except text, i.e. images, & PDF; s, Flash files & etc; binary templates are usually included in documents using shortcuts (e.g. images with img src = / src / url). some examples can be found in the template tree among global templates.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be of any text document type. on the basis of these templates new documents can be created. usually, more specific documents can be created in appropriate subfolders. it makes a simple framework for the purpose and organizes the work in an appropriate way to be efficient. some examples may be found in the template tree among global templates. see for more information about the template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This kind of template is useful if not a new document based on a template but the same text area should be inserted into the documents again and again. you can find everything from a comment about a final note to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl basis. some examples are available in the template tree below global templates. see for more information about the template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates serve as templates for whole websites. they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure, summarized in a compressed tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Design a document structure as desired (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;.) and choose File As a template Save As Local Template....</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once this is done, notice that (even though it has been saved as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree. look in the template tree under project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click Save As a template to save your selection as a local / project template. alternatively, the selection can be simply dragged and placed on the tree view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file can only be copied to a template folder. it can be used for all file management functions, such as dragging and inserting or inserting the file tree from Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">In the file tree or in the project file, you can click a folder on the right and select site template, enter a name for the template and secure it. by default, it is backed up in the project folder, but of course it can be saved as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates allow a very goal-oriented approach. you can pretend headers and footers, or dynamically with & PHP; design, insert or associate with them. additionally, you can keep a few things in mind when using templates in projects.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the subwindow Templates is based on the files placed in $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / templates and $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / templates. each of these folders is one of four types of containers as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To set the behavior of a folder, click the folder with the right mouse button and select Properties from the context menu. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection field with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is dazzled once parental attributes are corrupted.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and fits everything except the root folders in the template list. if a regular folder is set, it would disable templates in this path except they would be explicitly enabled. in case of a normal folder, the blah would appear with something like text module. if nothing appears, you probably find yourself in a root folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows previous or imprinted text templates for templates in this folder. this could be general headers or footers for all templates for a specific project and allows you to copy content templates into a folder with custom headers / footers for a whole presentation with the appropriate headers / footers.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, by using context menu (pointing to right mouse button), you have a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and inserting templates from one location to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; provides two modes: VPL; editor and VPL; & Source editor, which can be accessed through the View menu. the first mode replaces the source text editor by the VPL; editor and the second divides the editor window into two parts: the source text editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; -page and a cursor. then you can edit and switch back to the source editor if required, in which the changes made in the VPL; editor in the source code are visible.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; -Editor in a document that & PHP; contains, a small green symbol shows the default of & PHP; source code. it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL; editor. to edit and PHP, the source text editor is still necessary. there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works just like the first one, except that at the same time the changes are visible in the source text editor and in the VPL; editor, this mode is already active, the keystroke moves the active cursor from one window to another, while maintaining the position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronization interval between the VPL; editor and the source text editor can be set up via settings Quanta. by choosing VPL; you can choose between synchronisation by one click or automatically. in principle, the time interval can be set automatically. in principle, the recommendation: a small span for fast computers and a large span for slow computers.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Assuming you want to change the title of the website, the tool is able to select document properties. this makes it possible to edit invisible tags when working with the VPL; editor. the document properties dialog is also called as soon as a new document is created using the VPL; editor. this is used to reduce the manual coding. this allows you to change the following:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allow storing information about the document itself e.g. keywords for internet search engines. meta elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below. a click on the list allows to change the content, e.g. key words on the column name and keyword key word 2 on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way of creating pages in your browser. you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons under the list. editing CSS rules is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS styling template by pressing the File Open button and selecting the appropriate file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">Using the cursor is possible as in word processing, because of moving with the arrows. under rare circumstances, the cursor behaves especial. the mark functions as usual. text can be inserted by typing and deleted by button or distance key.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Inserting tags is done in the same way via the toolbar, as in the source text editor. note that inserting tags previously already existing identical tags will not be removed e.g. when an anchor tag, surrounded by text, must be removed any other armature tag.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some toolbar buttons such as the Sheets Assistant or the Listen Assistant are disabled. you will later work in & VPL; in this release, the tables or lists need to be used toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2227">& xsldbg; is a tool for the study of style sheets. unlike other styles for style sheets, searching for certain elements is possible and the style template can be followed.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools to compare. why & kdiff3;? let me briefly explain why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated because one of the contributors had made many changes and at the same time corrected the indentation at many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result was numerous conflicts when merging.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program I used showed me only the changed lines, but I could not see what exactly happened within these lines. and there was no indication of the places where perhaps only the indentation had changed. merging these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could show differences within one line and changes to white characters. later, a lot of other useful functions have been added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to compare text quickly, simply copy it to the clipboard and insert it in one of the comparative windows.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was comparing and merging folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost into a full file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way merge is fully supported. this is useful when two people work independently of each other on a piece of code and make changes. the original file (the base) helps & kdiff3; in this editor you can even edit the result directly. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three source files when merging:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you compare and merge entire folders. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; in folder merging:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; shows the exact differences and deals with the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you frequently need to check code, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white characters and tabs are displayed visibly. if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters, you can see this at a glance at the summary in the column on the left. (no more trouble if somebody changes the indentation.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is equal and the other differs in one line then the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both are different.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name but are in different folders, then you can ease the typing work by completely writing the file name of the first file. for example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Kdiff3 folder 1 folder 2 kdiff3 folder 1 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 3 folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">The opening dialog allows manual typing of file names, selecting a file browser (file...) or selecting a last opened file from the drop-down list. the opening dialog registers your selection and displays it again next time. you do not need to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C empty, the analysis of the differences with two files is performed.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Over the button folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the comparing and merging of folders will be initiated. if a file is selected for A, for B and C a folder is then used & kdiff3; the filename from A in the other two folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">When merging is checked, the input field is activated for target and can be edited. however, it is not necessary to immediately set a output file. you can also do this step later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The Setup button opens a dialog with Settings. here you can set options before starting to merge / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to drag text parts from the clipboard into the active comparative window. the comparison begins immediately. in the Open dialog you do not need to select files, you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag and drop: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">What idea is behind it? sometimes a file contains several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar to these functions, it would be a relatively big effort. you first need to create two corresponding files, load them in & kdiff3; load them and then compare them. now you can simply copy, paste and then compare the relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently, you can't remove anything from & kdiff3; just extract the dropping of text into a comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the drawing and dropping of text into another program as cut and paste (instead of copy and paste). in such a case, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">In the upper part of each text window is the info line. the info line of the source pane contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that window C is optional.) Each Info line has a different color. (if the path is too long, leave the mouse over the line for a while. then a small auxiliary window will show the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three spring fingers are assigned the letters A, B and C. A has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these preferences can be changed via the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">If a difference is detected, one sees the color, which file differs. if both files differ, the default color for it is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files. that's good to see in the next section (merge).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In addition to the text there is the summary column. if differences are found, the color displays the corresponding color. in some programming languages where white characters are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (for C / C + +, for example, white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in rare, rare cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line separating the summary column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no lines. if the line breaks are activated, the line is dotted with broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (among the comparative windows) also has an info line with the title Output:, the filename and [changes] if you edited the result. usually it contains text, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!! until all conflicts are resolved, saving is disabled!!! (use the Jump to next resolved / unresolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparative windows are used, any difference at the same time is also a conflict that needs to be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in the assembly column in one of the windows the group belonging to the row will be selected in all windows and the first row of the group will be displayed. (this will also highlight a jump of position in the windows, where the beginning of the group would otherwise not be visible.) This group will then be highlighted with the color background color for current area and each on the left appears a black bar.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes by automatic merging or by manual editing, no further line remains in the group; then in these lines the text & lt; no row in the queue; displayed. this text appears neither in the final saved file, nor in a marker that you may copy and paste elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; merge conflict; however, appears in the clipboard if you copy such text from the result window. be careful with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: if the sources ignore the numbers or ignore Ignore C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigate up mainly with the scroll bars and the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you click in any of the windows, you can use the arrow keys left, right, high, down, side up, side from, beginning, end, Ctrl-beginning and Ctrl-end, Siv as you can also use it from other programs.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the preview window, you can also use the other buttons to edit. with the insertion button you can switch between insert and overwrite mode. (preset is the insert mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the summaries synchronizes the view of all windows at the beginning of each group (as explained in the Confusion section and the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons for navigating with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference, to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-picture Upward / Strg-picture downwards) or to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-picture Upward / Strg-picture downwards) or to the next / previous conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the marker to the clipboard, you need to press the Copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Insert). it also gives the option Selection Automatically. if this is enabled, whatever you select is automatically copied to the clipboard and the manual copy is omitted. be careful with this option, because you could accidentally override the contents of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system. Unix flavors use a line feed character\, and Win32-based systems do not use carriage return + newline feed\\ r\. KNO3 does not keep the line ending of the source files, therefore you should use & kdiff3; also not with binaries.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of the last used files will be saved automatically during the next start and restored at the next start. (menu Setting - &gt; KNO3 set up...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Select a font with fixed width. (on some systems the dialog also displays fonts with variable width to choose from, but you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you enable this option, differences are displayed in italic font. if the chosen script does not support this representation, nothing happens at all.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in their pure form, but would be rendered astert. on these systems, the button Preferences automatically introduces an odd color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">If this option is checked, the corresponding number of spaces is inserted when the Tab key is pressed. otherwise, a tab character is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">If you press Enter or Return, the indentation of the previous line will be automatically applied to the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">When this option is checked, each selection is automatically copied to the clipboard. the manual copy to the clipboard is then omitted.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which line type you prefer to save. the default value is the generally usual selection on the operating system used.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When comparing files, & kvili3; first, all completely identical lines can be found in the source files. only during this first step white characters can be ignored. the second step compares each line. in this step white characters are ignored. even when merging white characters are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a carriage return character '\\ r' and a line feed '\' at the end of a line, others save only a line feed '\'. usually ignored & kdiff3, but then files with different sizes in the side-to-side comparison will appear visible, but then they might be disabled with different sizes in the page-to-side comparison, but then this option has to be disabled. in default, this option is disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In the default, this option is deactivated. in the first part of the analysis, numbers and associated characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored. as a result, the differences are still displayed, but they are treated as white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2332">By default, this option is disabled. changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Search for even smaller differences. the option is enabled by default. it is effective for complicated and large files, but slow on very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In auto-skip mode, this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next unresolved conflict is jumped.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Automatically triggers all conflicts in white characters using the selected file as a source. (default is manual selection.) This is useful when white characters in many files are less important. if you need this only from time to time, then use better the features Choose A / B / C for all unresolved white conflicts from the merge menu. note that the automatic selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments when options ignore numbers or ignore Ignore C / C + + comments.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are discussed in the chapter on the scanning of folders and executing a merge. look for details under documentation on the directory comparison and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is saved and an older version already exists, then the original version will be appended to suffix .orig. if such a backup file exists with the suffix .orig, it will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adjust the language of the user interface. changing this option does not affect the current program. you need to change & kdiff3; exit and restart to make the change active. (this option is available in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is set global over the control center.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry. if you enable this option, the upper setting is used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">The encoding area for the encoding appears a short note of what the local coding is. (this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file encoding for source files. this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted. since encoding for each file is individually adjustable, even files with different encoding can be compared and merged.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can specify which encoding should be used for saving.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define pre-processing commands, they might not work with your codec. (for example, your files might be 16-bit unicode, but the default command can only handle 8-bit ASCII.) With this option you can set the encoding of the output of pre-processing commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn this off to suppress highlighting of changes in white characters in text or review columns. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments when options ignore numbers or ignore Ignore C / C + + comments.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences are displayed in a color coded overview column. but sometimes you may want to see only the differences between two of three files. by selecting A & lt; -gt; C or B & lt; -gt; C will appear next to the normal yet another overwiev column with the information you need.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines. just exit the less important windows. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">This can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you view the differences and then decide suddenly to merge the files. merge the current file in the merge menu, and then use the file name of the last source file as preset name for the output file. (if this function is used to restart the merge, then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file, it will first pass this external command. in & kdiff3, then the output of the command becomes visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own pre-processor that matches your needs. you can use this function, for example, to cut extraneous parts or to correct the indentation.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, it will first pass this external command. if a normal pre-processing command has been specified (see above), the output of the command is the input of this command line. you can write your own pre-processing command that corresponds exactly to your needs. each input line must have a corresponding output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind this is to allow the user more flexibility to set up the Diff results. however, an external program is needed and most users do not want to program it themselves. however, the good news is that in most cases sed or perl suffice completely.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this command line command for line abort to convert the input into uppercase letters: SED's /\\ (. *\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 / 'The\\ 1 in the replacement string refers to the found text in the first log pair. the\\ U converts the found text into uppercase.</seg>
<seg id="2353">The\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experiment with sed, you might begin to understand it and maybe you might like these regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers is actually an already built-in function in KNO3. but it is good as an example of another pre-processing command for line abutes. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Each sign between' ['and'] 'is a hit, and every hit is replaced by nothing, so it is virtually deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several replacements at once. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the replacements from each other. for example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed you can also use something else like perl -p -e's / regexp / replace / SCHALTER 'However, perl needs some details. where sed\\ (and\\) requires, perl needs only (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal preprocessor are retained for displaying and merging. the subsequent operations only change the data that the line abode algorythm sees.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases when using a normal preprocessor, the newline processor will see the output of the normal Preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function that changes text or hides differences, you may accidentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often programmers need to edit many files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare and merge entire folders recursively.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a suggestion for merging for each object; you can adjust the proposal before starting,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the merge and display the simulated changes without actually carrying out it,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... performs selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with the selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to comparing and merging individual files. you just need to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">When three folders are merged, folder 1 is used as the base. if no destination folder is specified, used & kdiff3; folder 3 as destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders starts automatically, not the merge. to start merging, you need to select the corresponding menu entry or press the F7 key. (see more details.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folder, you will inform a small news window of the current progress. if you cancel the scan of the folder, only the files that have been compared will be listed.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When scanning the folder is finished, it shows & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and folder found during the scan is shown here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually folded together. you can open a folder by double-clicking on the + / - or by double clicking on the + / - or by double-clicking the arrow keys for left / right. the directory menu contains two functions Select All subdirectories and open all subdirectories with which you can open or unfold all folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">When you double-click a file, the comparison window is started and a comparison window appears.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The name in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders, this is visible in the A / B / C columns and the details pane to the selected object. in such a case the merge action cannot be automatically selected. if the merge operation is started, you will be informed about problems of this type.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As shown in the picture above, the colors red, green, yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C.</seg>
<seg id="2376">With identical entries the color is also identical, even if the age of the entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered identically if their entire content is identical. then folders also have the same color. in folders the age is insignificant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea for this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colors reflect the colors of a leaf which is only green, then yellow and later when it is old, red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical, but not B: copy of B (or if B does not exist, erase the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical, but not C: copy C (or if C does not exist, erase the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical, but not A: copy A (or if A does not exist, erase the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same type of file (e.g. if A a folder and B is a file): errors: conflicting file types. as long as such faulty objects exist, merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B do not have the same type of file (e.g. if A a folder and B is a file): errors: conflicting file types. as long as such defective objects exist, merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The synchronizing mode is active if only two folders and no explicit target folder were specified and if the option synchronizes directories. then select & kdiff3; then select the necessary action so that both folders are identical. if for one entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist but are not identical: merge and save the result in both folders. (the user sees as visible file name for the output file only B; copied & kdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">When two folders are merged and the option New file instead of merge select (unsure) is enabled, then explores & kdiff3; the date of the files and suggests the newer file to copy. if the files are different, but the date is identical. if such errors are not removed, the merge of the folders cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">While merging, one file is processed after the other. you status column shows Fertig if the merge was successful, and accordingly other messages when something unexpected occurred. if the merge is completed, you should make a final check and check if the status is all right.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If in the setup dialog the file comparison method is selected Full Analysis, KDiff3 will display additional columns. these contain the number of unresolved, deleted, non-white and white conflicts. (the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either merge the just selected entry (file or odds), or all entries at once. if you have selected all the merge actions (also in all subfolders), you can start merging.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you have not specified a destination folder, C will be used as a destination in the three-folder merging mode. B is chosen as the target while synchronizing A and / or B as the target.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a destination folder, please check whether all entries should be in the destination folder, even in the folder structure. there are some options to skip through certain entries. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all entries: select start / continue directory merge / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (the keyboard shortcut). to only merge the current item: select action of the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If the conflicting file types still exist invalid merge actions, a message appears that indicates the defective elements. you can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you merge all entries, a dialog box will appear with the Browse options, simulating and Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select Simulate if you want to see what would happen without actually making any changes. you will then receive a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; performs certain actions with all entries. if a manual intervention is necessary (merge a single file), then a merge window opens (note the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">When you are finished with a file, select again directory merge / continue or press F7. if you haven't saved yet, a corresponding dialog will appear. then, & kde3 will continue; its work will continue with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If & kdiff3; click on a bug, a message appears and detailed status information. at the end of the list, you will see some error messages that will help you to choose the cause of the problem. if you continue to merge (F7 key), lets you choose another action for the entry or solve the problem in a different way before you proceed with merging.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries have been merged individually, these entries (in the current session) will not be merged. even if the merge has been skipped or not saved, these entries will be considered finished. only if you change the merge action, these entries will be merged.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Preferences menu from & kdiff3; (menu Setting - &gt; Set Default...) now has a section called directory merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files matching the given pattern are displayed in the element tree. you can enter multiple patterns. separate the patterns with a semicolon;. valid placeholders: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default is *. folders must not match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as a separator. valid placeholders: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as a separator. valid placeholders: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignore files that would also be ignored by CVS. many autmatically generated files are ignored by CVS. the big advantage is that this folder-specific file can be set with a .cvsignore file. (see info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some filesystems, files have a default attribute. in other file systems, a previous point marks a file than hidden. this option lets you decide if these files should be displayed in the Elemental Tree or not. this option is switched on in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">In case of links to files: if the option is switched off, symbolic links are compared. if the option is enabled, the files are compared to which the links point. this is downlighted in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">When the option is switched off, the symbolic links are compared. if the option is turned on, the links will be treated as normal folders and recursively scanned. (note that & kdiff3, which contains a link to itself, would result in an infinite loop and & kdiff3; crashes.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Performs a complete analysis of each file and displays the statistic columns. (the number of deleted, unresolved, non- white and white conflicts.) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower when applied to files that do not contain any text. (enter a corresponding anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders over a slow network, it may be faster to compare only the modification date and file size. however, this speed advantage will cost you a certain amount of security. please use caution with caution. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to the date of change. there is no real comparison. the files are considered identical if they are equal to size. this can be useful, for example, when copying the modification date. please use caution with caution. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Enables synchronizing mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder is specified. in this mode, the suggestions for merging are selected so that afterwards both folders are identical. also the results of merging files are stored in both folders. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, the copying of the newer file is suggested as an action. (this is considered unsafe because it is assumed that the other file has not been modified too. you should check this in any case.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another, then the original version will be renamed and the extension .orig. If an old backup file with the .orig extension already exists, it will be deleted without further backup. this also applies to the normal merging of single files, not just the merging of entire folders. this option is turned on in default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally, the folder merging view remains visible during the merge of single files; you can move the window divider with the mouse. if you do not want it, you can switch off the window divider with the mouse. if you do not want this, you can switch off main window in the window menu and switch between the directory & text window between the two views.</seg>
<seg id="2415">You can also merge a single file directly without having to start the folder merging. you can also merge a single file directly without having to start the folder merging. as soon as you save the result, the status will be saved and the file will not be merged once you start the folder merging.</seg>
<seg id="2416">However, this status is lost when you re-read the directory: directory menu: re-read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with KIO slaves. KNO3 uses this to read files and folders. in this way, you can specify files and folders to open, located on local or remote machines.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file to an FTP server. the second command line compares a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax as local files and folders. you should note a few things:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relative and. or.. contained. this is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be escaped. (# - &gt;% 23, empty string &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # has the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes because of the filesystem on the server, sometimes using the protocol. it follows a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished whether a link shows a file or folder. then a file is always assumed to be a link target. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to edit permissions or modification dates. therefore, the permissions or the modification date deviate from the original. (please refer to the Confidential of the size.) (This is possible only for local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose of use is currently the differences viewer in KDEVELOP. KDEVELOP always starts the built-in difference viewer. to start KDE3, press the right mouse button above the Different Viewer and then select In KDef3Part from the contextual menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Usually requires & kdiff3; two complete input files. if it is used as a node, & kdiff3; specify the name of the original files from the patch file. at least one of the files must exist. at least one of the files must exist. then starts & kdiff3; the patch program to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Konqueror you can click on a patch file and select it from the context menu Preview in - KDiff3Part. please note that this does not work unless the original files have changed since the patch file was created.</seg>
<seg id="2428">When & kdiff3; executed as part, it only supports comparing two files, a very small toolbar and menu. merging or comparing folders is not supported in the node mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and KDef2 (now called pare) already exist. furthermore, the name KNO3 already indicates that it can merge as the program diff3 from the Diff Tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I have been using GPL programs for a long time and learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs. this is my thank you to all programmers who have gone this way or they will go that way.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You compiled the program from the sources and probably didn't tell the configure script to KDE. in default configure installed configure in / usr / local, but then KDE installs the resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find more information on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters varies, the lines will first be treated as identical, but if only a non-white character is different, the line will be treated as not identical. iF similar lines are next to each other, this is the right purpose. this is often the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor notes for any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends. this is necessary to easily resolve a conflict by clicking in the source text and selecting the button A / B / C. this important information is lost though the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to create extra a separate file format that could store this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort required was so far too big. you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C. in order to process larger amounts of text another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text is suddenly healed; no src sweeps; appeared and the text cannot be deleted. what does it mean and how can that be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; used already many colors to highlight differences. even more emphasis would be confusing and missing the purpose. please use another editor.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all functions of & kdef3; you need to use & kde; 3.1 or later.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information on how to use KDef3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">A list of recent changes can be found under http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net or ChangeLog or in the file ChangeLog in the source package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile and install on a system with & kde; use the following command in the base folder of the & kdiff3; distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir returns the folder in your system where KDE is installed. if you are unsure, you will find more details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Da & kdiff3; autoconf and automake used, you should not have problems when compiling. however, if difficulties occur, please report to the & kde; -mailinglists of it.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut (Ctrl-X or Shift) copies to the clipboard and deletes the selected text. insert (Ctrl-V or Shift-Insert) paste the text from the clipboard at the current cursor position respectively replaces the current selection.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Show only differences: files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure, and therefore not in the destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, you need to re-read the folder with the refresh function after changes to these options.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">There are only entries showing differences. this also causes identical files to be copied to the destination folder when merging. if the destination folder does not already contain these files, they will be missing after merging. (the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons to select the source using the A, B and C label below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the rows from the corresponding window will be appended to the end of the selected group in the results window (if they are not already present). if the rows are already present, they will be removed by clicking on the button.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In default, this option is disabled. differences in individual characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated as differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & Kpager; shows a mini preview of all virtual desktops. it is quite practical to see the running programs on the work surfaces, change their size, finish them or shift them. this works both within a desktop and several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & Kpager; it can display all virtual desktops as well as the applications running in it. applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button, windows can be moved inside & pager; moving is possible both within a desktop and on other work surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked: if on the empty background of & Kpager; when clicked, the context menu has only the two entries Pager to set up... and exit. if, however, click on an application within & Kpager; clicking on an application within & Kpager; if however, click on an application within & Kpager; additionally, the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries Minimize, Maximize, On Desktop and Finish.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window to the full size of the desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to the selected virtual desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is selected, windows can be moved within the & Kpager; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other areas of work.</seg>
<seg id="2457">When this field is selected, the names of the virtual desktops will be displayed in & Kpager.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Tick this field lets the & Kpager; display the numbers of the virtual desktops. if it is checked together with the name, the names are provided with folder numbers, & eg; 1. desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2459">If this field is selected, the background of each desktop will also be displayed as background in & Kpager.</seg>
<seg id="2460">When this field is selected, the running programs are displayed as small windows in & Kpager; otherwise, only empty spaces are displayed to enable their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window is selected. the window with its default symbol and pixel map shows a small view of the actual program window. note: Pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the arrangement of the & Kpager; main window can be determined: classically lets & Kpager; in a 2xN Grid appear, as is known from Pager applications in some other Windows managers; horizontal indicates all virtual desktops in a horizontal and vertical row, which is very good for viewing at the side on the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & Kpager; can be used as an alternative to the Pager mini program in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size, displaying and moving the windows as symbols or with their contents. furthermore, it runs outside the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Right-click within & Kpager; and then set up selector switch... allows the dialog to appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">At the moment, this cannot be changed in the Settings dialog. but you can do this manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc with any text editor such as & kedit; or vi.If you do not have a write permission for the file, you must log in as user root or contact your system administrator. in this file you have to enter the key windowTransparentMode and assign a value to it. possible values are:</seg>

<seg id="2480">& knot; is a screen loupe. you can use & knot; enlarge a part of the screen, as if you read a magnifying glass for the print or the exact viewing of a photo. this application is interesting for different users: these include artists, web designers and people with visual impairment. this documentation should be a complete manual for the use of & k.a</seg>
<seg id="2481">& knot; is a very powerful application that is constantly expanded with new functions. it is optimized for use on low-performance computers.</seg>
<seg id="2482">If you like & knot; start, a window appears as shown above. the main window of & knot; shows the enlarged area of the screen. in the following, this window is called magnifying window. the image that is displayed in the magnifying window is an enlarged area of the screen and is listed below as a selection window.</seg>
<seg id="2483">In the default setting, & knot; the range around the mouse pointer is like a moving magnifying glass. alternatively you can drag & knot; this causes a selected screen area in the magnifying window (selection window mode) or the surroundings of the mouse pointer at the edge of the screen (eg; on the left side of the screen).</seg>
<seg id="2484">If you want to avoid that the mouse pointer is displayed in the enlarged window, select the setting of the mouse cursor. please note that & knot; currently not able to recognize the shape of the mouse pointer. this is always the default kde; / Qt; mouse pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2485">In the drop-down mode, you can adjust the selection window to your own needs. you can move it with the arrow keys and mouse buttons and change its size. this can be done in the following way:</seg>
<seg id="2486">Move the mouse cursor in the magnifying window and hold the left mouse button down so you can capture and move the content of the magnifier window. this also works with the arrow keys.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If you additionally press the & Shift key, or use the & MMB; you can move the selection window.</seg>
<seg id="2488">This combination allows you to change the size of the selection window. note that the top left corner of the selection window remains fixed and only the lower right corner is to be moved.</seg>
<seg id="2489">& knot; has a lot of functions. you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer, save it into a file, copy it to the clipboard (to insert it later into other applications), rotate the image and much more.</seg>
<seg id="2490">Stopping or stopping the ad update. stopping the update will cause the needed CPU time to go against 0.</seg>
<seg id="2491">Select the refresh rate (Very low, Gering, Medium, High, Very high). the higher the refresh rate, the more CPU time is needed.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In this mode, a selection box is displayed. the selected area is displayed in a window.</seg>
<seg id="2493">& knot; automatically uses your set shortcuts to save files, open a new window, print, reloads (recharge the document in & konqueror;), zoom in and down, etc;.</seg>
<seg id="2494">May also be known as & kmagnifier; is a screen loupe. you can magnify & kmagnifier; use a magnifier to view the small print in a newspaper or photo. this application is useful for different people: from research or artist to web designer or visually impaired.</seg>

<seg id="2497">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click as soon as the mouse pointer resides for a while in the same place. it is intended to help people suffering from RSI's syndrome (Repetitive-Strain-Injury Syndrome) and which every mouse click causes pain.</seg>
<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click as soon as the mouse pointer resides in the same place. it is intended to help people who suffer from the Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) syndrome and which every mouse click causes pain. besides, it can emulate the pulling with the mouse. this requires a little practice though.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can circumvent the pain created when you click the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without any pain. unfortunately, you may experience pain caused by using your computer, you should consult a doctor if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To make it clear even once: even if & kmousetool; avoid pain caused by mouse clicks, it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse. and as with all ergonomic aids, the result can be different for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movement and performs a mouse click as soon as you pause the movement briefly.</seg>
<seg id="2502">Is the intelligent shift enabled, makes & kmousetool; a pause after pressing the mouse button. move the mouse, wait until the end of the movement until releasing the mouse button. in this way, you can perform a little exercise, but you get used to it quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This residence time must be cached after the end of the mouse movement before & kmousetool; a click of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If Intelligentes Move enabled, the shooting time is activated (1 / 10 s). here the time is set, the & kmousetool; after pressing down the mouse button waits before releasing the mouse button again if no moving of the mouse takes place.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; now supports clicking through mouse shift. if this function is enabled, a slow moving to the left and back leads to a double click. these movements are stored in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool _ strokes.txt, when & kmousetool; the first time is started, but they can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">If the sound is delayed, you can drag & kde to shorten the response time. go to Sound & Multimedia, select Sound System and here the General tab. there's a slider sound buffer that lets you adjust to a lower value to shorten response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is checked, & kmousetool will be launched at every start. this function is currently only available under & kde; this function is currently only available under & kde; at GNOME or other window environments, please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Reset all settings to the values set when the dialog opens. if you have already pressed the Apply button, the settings are reset to the stand after the last pressing of the user.</seg>
<seg id="2509">The best use is & kmousetool; first of all, with the default settings. in particular, the intelligent shifting should be switched off initially. if you then get used to the automatic mouse click, you can later accept the intelligent moving.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click it may be necessary to reduce the response times of & kde; for sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First, you should be aware of what places a mouse click without effect: clicking on the neutral components of windows or places in the browser window that does not represent a link does not lead to unwanted reactions. you can therefore park your mouse in such places until you want to use it again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">When your mouse bucks, you should clean your mouse. this is usually quite simple. the trick is that you do not only clean the mouse ball, but also the rollers that come into contact with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First you need to take out the mouse ball. how this happens is different from mouse to mouse. however, it should be clear when you look at the bottom of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the rolls. these are located on the sides of the hole into which the ball was inserted. the dirt and the dirt can easily scrape with a flat blade or the fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations the operating system interrupts the execution of & kmousetool; if you are using the intelligent moving, this means that & kmousetool; the operation is no longer able to stop the operation by releasing the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; using another window manager and moving a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution to this problem is that you make a click of the mouse. this will reset the status of & kmousetool, and you can continue working as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, try & kmousetool; continue to execute mouse clicks and put the cursor to another place.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor to where you want it. but use the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop when you want to have a keyboard input. secure zones for the mouse pointer are & eg; the gray surfaces around the toolbar and menus and the front rows of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with the intelligent moving, but I don't manage to edit lyrics.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The intelligent moving is an advanced feature of & kmousetool; and it takes its time before you can handle it. it is very well possible to select text to copy it into the clipboard and insert it again or execute any other action where you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use the smart move if you just start using & kmousetool; instead, press a mouse click at the end of the text area and hold the Shift key while moving the mouse cursor to the other end of the text and click the mouse button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. this always plays when & kmousetool; the mouse button plays a sound like a mouse click. so you know exactly when the move time begins with the intelligent moving. later you can use the intelligent moving without the mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To use & kmousetool; be able to use the XTest extension for & X Window; this should be the case on most system.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the mouse click is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers and these are correctly set up.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; press the mouse button as soon as the mouse pointer resides briefly. this program has been developed for people who suffer from RSI syndrome and those affected by the cracking of the mouse buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool; can also be configured to start a drawing process before releasing the mouse button. in this way, drag and drop can be done with the mouse.</seg>

<seg id="2531">With the program & kmouth, silent users can let the computer speak for themselves. the user can select phrases that are to be spoken again from a list with the conversation history.</seg>
<seg id="2532">On the first page of the wizard (left screen shot) enter the command that will be used later for the speech output of text. for more details, see the description of the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2533">On the second page you can choose the standard text entry book. from the text passages you can often choose text passages without having to type them. the text passages can of course be edited.</seg>
<seg id="2534">On the third page (right screen shot) you determine the dictionary for the word completion. & kmouth; reads the KDE documentation of the selected language to determine the frequency of individual words. in addition, you can synchronize the word lists with an OpenOffice.org dictionary, so that only correctly spelled words can be added to the word extension.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The main window of & kmouth; is clear and contains essentially an input field for the keyboard input of your propositions (the lower white field in the screenshot) and a delay memory of the already spoken sentences (the upper white field in the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2536">If you have set correctly, you can enter the phrases you want to hear in the input field. each spoken proposition is attached to the expiration memory. you can select sets which are to be spoken again.</seg>
<seg id="2537">With the menu entry Settings kmouth; set up... open the Settings dialog from & kmouth;. this dialog contains two flashcards, voice output and settings, page wortercurrent as well as the KTTSD language service page.</seg>
<seg id="2538">In the input field of the box speech output you enter the command to call the voice generator. in the box under the input field, specify the character encoding that will be passed on to the voice generator.</seg>
<seg id="2539">& kmouth; knows two ways to pass the text. select the check box if the text should be passed on as standard input to the voice generator.</seg>
<seg id="2540">If the check box is not selected, the text will be passed as a parameter. you can use the following wildcards:</seg>
<seg id="2541">Of course, the command to voice output depends on your language generator. you will find this command in the documentation for your language generator. examples for this are found in the appendix.</seg>
<seg id="2542">With Possible kttsd as a language service is used & kmouth; first try to pass the text to KTTSD language service. if this is successful, the other settings on this page are ignored. kttsd language service is a & kde; -daemon, the & kde; -applications a standardized interface for voice output is available and which is currently being developed in the SVN. the choice of this option is useful even if KTTSD is not installed.</seg>
<seg id="2543">The first selection field action after selecting a text passage tells you which action is triggered by the shortcut or by choosing a text passage in the Text passage book or in the bar for text passages.</seg>
<seg id="2544">With the selection of Sofort he will speak the selected passage directly and additionally inserted into the expiry date. with the selection of Add to the input field, the selected passage is entered only in the input field.</seg>
<seg id="2545">With the second selector closing of the editing window for text entry book, you can specify whether the text entry book should be saved automatically when the editing window is closed.</seg>
<seg id="2546">When you choose to make changes, the textbook book will not be saved. if you select to make changes, then the text entry book will not be saved. if you ask before saving, you will ask & kmouth; ask if the text entry script is to be saved.</seg>
<seg id="2547">The Wortercurrent page contains a list of dictionaries for word completion. in the main window next to the input field, & kmouth; a selection field, if this list contains more than one dictionary. with this selection box, you can select the currently used dictionary for word completion.</seg>
<seg id="2548">With buttons on the right of the page you can delete or add dictionaries, change the order of the books, or export them to a file. below the list, you can specify the name and the language for the dictionary in the input field.</seg>
<seg id="2549">Select the desired language for this source; & kmouth; then reads & kde; documentation. the frequency of each word is simply by counting the occurrence. in addition, you can compare the wordlist with an OpenOffice.org Dictionary to insert only properly written words into the new dictionary.</seg>
<seg id="2550">With this option you can merge the available dictionaries. & kmouth; then asks which dictionaries are merged, and how these dictionaries are to be weighted.</seg>
<seg id="2551">With this option, you create a new, empty dictionary with no entries. da & kmouth; automatically insert words entered into the dictionary, create a dictionary with your vocabulary in the course of time.</seg>

<seg id="2620">Filters are one of the advanced capabilities of & ktts; for normal work with & ktts; filters are not required.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In filters text is processed before it is sent to speech-Dispatchers. they are useful for improving pronunciation, to replace misspoken words or abbreviations, select a suitable language and speaker or to avoid certain deficiencies of speech synthesizers and their voices.</seg>
<seg id="2622">To understand the working method of filters, it is important to know how the 'speech-Dispatcher' program works with a text. & ktts; distinguishes four types of texts.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The output of screen readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and stops these jobs. if the output of the screen reader is read, the continued orders are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warning has the next priority. this level is important news as eg; processor is reserved to hot. a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders are resumed after issuing the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">News have the next highest priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that uses messages. while you can read a long text on a website, you can start with & kmouth; anyone who just enters the room. & kde; -alerts are also news.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text orders. each order you receive from the card card orders is a text order. KSayit is an example of an application that uses text orders. text orders are intended for the output of longer texts, which do not have any special urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four order cards are processed in queues, except for the output of screen readers. when an application sends the output of a screen reader, while & ktts; just one of them reads, this output is halted and ended.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen readers. they are applied to normal warnings, messages and text orders as well as on & kde; -messages.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filter the text and pass it on to the next filter. currently there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are designed as modules. in the future there may be further types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Strings replacing parts of a text by other text. you can specify the parts to be replaced either as words or as regular expressions. & ktts; it is delivered with predefined string sets which allow the creation of chat-emoticons such as: -) by text or for reformatting messages from & conversation; or & kmail; in a better intelligible form.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; converters use an XSLT file (XML; Style Language - Transforms) to convert from one format to another format. included in & ktts; are some XSLT files to translate & XHTML; contained in SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With subscriber selection filters you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to & ktts; sent to a speaker. for example, if you have set a female voice on the card board speaker, you can read the text from KDE messages about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these filters has adjustable rules, after which it is applied to a speech output. if the filter determines that its rules do not apply, the text will remain unchanged to the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">When a text order, a message, warning or a & kde; notification to & ktts; sent, it is processed by all activated filters that have been set up on the bottom. the processing by the filters is done in the order in the list from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2636">This shows the list of normal filters. if a filter is not checked, it is not activated and is not used. filters are processed from the top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2637">Click here to insert a new filter. select the type of filter and the following guidelines will be displayed below.</seg>
<seg id="2638">For setting string offset filters you have to enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparison patterns. if these patterns are found in the text, then the text is exchanged for the corresponding replacement text.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Enter a name for your filter. you can choose this name arbitrarily, it only needs to be distinguished from the names of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with the strings in the column and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column annotation. the list is executed in the order from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2641">Click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2642">With these buttons you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file, save or delete the current list. load a list from a file, the entries from the file are appended to the existing list.</seg>
<seg id="2643">If a language is entered here, the filter will only be applied if the spokesperson for the text order speaks one of the languages mentioned here. click the button to view a list of languages. you can also select multiple languages if you press the & Ctrl + key at the click of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2644">If a value is entered here, the filter will only be applied if the text comes from one of the specified applications. you can enter several programs separated by commas. example: conversation, kmail</seg>
<seg id="2645">The application ID of running programs is available with the program qdbus;. the & dbus; numbers must be omitted. if, for example, & qdbus; the application ID copy-3432 indicates, you may only enter copies.</seg>
<seg id="2646">The string replacement filter is only applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Diesen filter if all input fields are empty, the filter is applied to all texts.</seg>
<seg id="2647">When comparing words, the string replacement filter uses regular expressions in the form\\ s word\\. so words must be limited on both sides by separators (spaces).</seg>
<seg id="2648">In this manual you will find no instructions for writing regular expressions. if you have installed the & kde; -Editor & # 160; for & # 160; Regular & # 160; Regular & # 160; Regular & # 160; Regular & # 160; Expressions you can find in the package ambiguity.</seg>
<seg id="2649">XML; transformers translate & XML; using XSLT files from one format to another format. XSLT (XML; Style Language - Transforms) is a W3C standard for such transformations. it can only be applied to well-formed XML. it can only be applied to well-formed XML. the xsltproc utility program must be installed on your system.</seg>
<seg id="2650">Enter the path for the program xsltproc. if xsltproc can be reached via the PATH environment variable, xsltproc suffices.</seg>
<seg id="2651">With the spokesman selection filter, you can send texts to a particular speaker, which is set on the card box speaker, or to a speaker with specific features. you can, for example, specify that texts should be read by kmail from a female voice. see.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Before & tts; a text is passed to the filter, it looks for a speaker for the text. the speaker is selected based on the speaker properties that specify the program that sends the text to & ktts; sends, and the properties of the speakers equipped on the card card speaker. with the speaker selection filter, you can override the selected speaker.</seg>
<seg id="2653">If a value is entered here, the filter is applied if the text contains the entered regular expression. is installed on your system of the & kde; -Editor & # 160; for & # 160; Regular & # 160; Regents installed, you can call it by clicking on the button to get help when entering.</seg>
<seg id="2654">In order to achieve faster processing, you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string, i.e., start the regular expression with &lt;! [CDATA [^]] &gt;.</seg>
<seg id="2655">Specify the characteristics of the speaker you want. if the text meets the filter conditions shown above, the speaker is selected to match the desired requirements. click on the button on the right to display the dialog box selection dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Use these buttons to save or load your microphone settings or delete all settings.</seg>
<seg id="2657">The speaker output filter is only applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Diesen filter if applicable. you must enter at least one condition.</seg>

<seg id="2677">Speech-Dispatcher's program uses an adaptable module architecture for voice synthesizers. if you want to expand & tt for using a different synthesizer, contact the developer team.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The xsltproc utility is used for the support of SSML and for the & XML; conversion filter, but is not mandatory. Debian users can install xsltproc with the apt-get install xsltproc command.</seg>
<seg id="2679">To compile and run, you need a current KDE development environment (version 3.4 or later) including the kdelibs package and the developer files for the 'speech-Dispatcher' program.</seg>
<seg id="2680">If you have the source code from & ktts; from the source code archive for caching, or have downloaded the tarball that you created all night, compile and install the program using the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2681">Before you use & ktts; check first whether speech-Dispatcher works correctly with your voice synthesizer. you can use the shell script spd-conf to do so.</seg>
<seg id="2682">& ktts; in & kde; 4.4 is the first version of & ktts; the program kttmsgr should be developed in such a way that the setup of speech discards is possible and the script spd-conf is no longer needed.</seg>
<seg id="2683">A long text is broken down into individual sentences. the user can go back, repeat, stop or cancel instructions or paragraph style.</seg>
<seg id="2684">If an application provides text to & ktts, it can specify the properties of the preferred speaker for the output. if you have set up a speaker whose language English and its gender is female, this will be used, otherwise the best suitable speaker is chosen. if you want to know more about how & tts; select a speaker, you will see in.</seg>
<seg id="2685">If you click on Add button on the tab card and in order to add a speaker to the list or click Edit, the box for speaker placement will be displayed. for example, the module for Festival Interactive is shown below.</seg>
<seg id="2686">Enter the path to the festival program executable. if the path to Festival is included in PATH, you only need to enter the festival.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Select the character encoding for text submitted to the festival. in the case of voices, the & ktts; this setting is done automatically. in general, Western languages use ISO 8859-1, Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2688">These sliders allow you to adjust volume, speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language. if you cannot select some control and display this grey, the voice you choose doesn't allow these settings to be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Several voices like multi-syn voices require several seconds to be loaded because of their size. when you mark this check box, these voices are already loaded at the start of KTTLED, so that (with bigger memory consumption) the first set is synthesized faster.</seg>
<seg id="2690">If this check box cannot be selected, you have not yet set up a speaker (or click on user to click).</seg>
<seg id="2691">If this check box is selected, the program window is displayed at the start of a tmgr. otherwise, after the start, only the symbol tmgr in the system section is visible, but not the program window. click the icon in the system section to display the program window.</seg>
<seg id="2692">If this check box is marked and ttsmgr doesn't run yet, it appears in the system area as soon as KTTSD reads a text. this allows you to stop or otherwise control the reading.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Here are all orders listed in the queue, along with the application that has set the order, the current status of the order, the number of sets and the currently processed set. the speaker ID corresponds to the column ID on the card box speaker.</seg>
<seg id="2694">With the buttons in this series, you can move forward or backward in the order selected in the list below. (but not every job consists of several sets).</seg>
<seg id="2695">By clicking on OK, all changes in the settings (also on the other card cards) are taken over and ttmgr will be reduced to the icon in the system section. then click on this icon to view the program window again.</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and propositional filters (SDB filters). thus, SBDs can begin to divide words into individual sentences. this way, you can start or stop or pause and stop assignments on the card card, even if the voice synthesizer doesn't support this directly.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you see the propositional marker filter. at the first start of & ktts, a set limit identifier is automatically set up. you can change its settings or add other propositional filters, but beginners will not be discouraged.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The easiest way to learn how to set up the speaker selection by checking out. turn off the speaker selection and enter text to read. if you switch the speaker selection again, change some properties and check the selection of the speaker. of course, you need to have more than one speaker set up, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktts; then faster with pre-reading, since only the first set needs to be processed and not the whole text block, which can last very long,</seg>
<seg id="2731">You can pause or cancel text orders on the card card even if the voice synthesizer doesn't support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal propositional code detection filter is automatically set up when you start ttsmgr for the first time. it can not be switched off, only removed. do not change anything at this filter unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Propositional code filters compare text with a regular expression for punctual ends and add a tab character (decimal code 8) to the set limits (tabs are removed from the text in front of the filter). note that the default set constraint detection filter maintains the punctuation.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filters are never applied to & kde; -messages (knotify), warnings, messages or the output of screen readers.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed the normal propositional code filter, you can insert it again by loading the file standard _ sbdrc included in & tts.</seg>
<seg id="2736">On the tab card selection you can overwrite the speech settings for the application.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Use of the standard speaker (the top one on the card card speaker). in other words: no speaker properties are specified.</seg>
<seg id="2738">Use of the most appropriate speaker, which has all the characteristics of an equipped speaker. if you do not delete or edit the speaker's settings, select & ktts; this speaker. otherwise select & ktts; the speaker that best matches the originally set characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Select the method to input the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Select the characteristics of the desired speaker. if this feature does not matter, enter nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Select this check box if the property is to take precedence over other properties. you can also set several markers here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">As the language is a critical factor when understanding the output, it is always treated as a primary feature. you will rarely use this feature. the only case you may want to specify the attribute language is when you know that a particular application text is sent in another language than the one in the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To delete all the features in the Speaker area, which is best suited to the following, click on the Standard Speaker button and then use a speaker that is most likely to follow the following.</seg>

<seg id="2751">On the map audio card there is a setting speed. to make this work, the program needs to be installed sox and can be discoverable via the PATH environment variable. some synthesizer moduls such as Festival Interactive even offer a setting for speed on the card box for subscriber setup. depending on the selected voice, this is active or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">The chat speed settings are ignored when & tts; & HTML. (this is because the HTML is converted into SSML.) or, if you are quite brave, change the .xsl file of the & HTML; -after-SSML remodel filter, and set up the speech speed.</seg>

<seg id="2798">This manual explains the installation and use of & knetworkconf;, a module for the & kcontrolcenter; which allows the administration of network interfaces, routing and DNS settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolcenter; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a uniform, integrated interface. the & kcontrolcenter; can be called by selecting K menu kcontrolcenter.</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf; -package is designed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the & kcontrolcenter; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation, a new module network settings in the & kcontrolcenter will be displayed. the network settings module (knetworkconf;) can be started by selecting kcontrolcenter; Internet & Network network settings in & KMenu.</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetworkconf; network hardware cannot install. physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured to allow & knetworkconf; the device at all displays and allows setting the network properties.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and installed when installing & linux. if network devices are added later, the drivers need to be loaded by adjusting the following files, according to the kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The network settings module is loaded when the network settings option is selected in the & kcontrolcenter; -Index. when starting the module network settings, this will automatically detect the used platform on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be recognized, the manual selection is offered. it is the platform from the list to choose which corresponds to the distribution and the release process. by marking the setting No-again-questions, the definition can be made permanently. when starting the network settings, this selection is automatically pre-set.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings is possible only in the system management mode. before, all options are shown in grey, which means, the settings can only be viewed, the change is not possible. in the system management mode, click the button system management mode at the right lower end of the module. it is necessary to enter the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">The overall functionality of the module is available in the system management mode. this is divided into three tabs:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The network interfaces can be used to manage the network devices of the system. all available network devices are displayed. the following tasks can be performed by the network interfaces:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The settings of displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button interface... in the Settings dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. click the Advanced Settings button displays the dialog with further options.</seg>
<seg id="2811">With the option Automatically, the TCP / IP settings are fetched from a DHCP server or BOOTP server. in automatic mode, the TCP / IP settings for the system are carried out simultaneously with the start of the system services. DHCP or BOOTP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information at each system start, so no further setting is required. in the selective list, either DHCP or BOOTP, according to the system, can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2812">Using Manually, the TCP / IP configuration can be configured without DHCP or BOOTP. in the input field IP address, the desired TCP / IP address must be specified.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this setting is selected, the system initializes the network interface when booting. if the initialization is undesirable, this option should not be enabled.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address on the network is not already used. entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict. with ping in the & Console, you can determine if the desired address is already in use. in case of doubt, the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices can be activated or switched off, depending on your needs. switching a switched network device is done by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface....</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network devices can be activated or disabled according to your needs. disabling an activated network device can be deactivated by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface....</seg>
<seg id="2818">Specifies the IP address of the host in the local subnet which communicates the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other subnets.</seg>
<seg id="2819">If there is more than one network interface on the computer, the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is located.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A computer with DNS support replaces a full domain name by the corresponding IP address. this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses. if the host http: / / www.einedomain.org, DNS dissolves this name into an IP address like 123.45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The name resolution calculator section of the Reider name resolution allows easy management of this list. entries can be added, removed, or changed. DNS records can be added by selecting an entry or downgrading in the list with the buttons Hindered or Herunter in priority.</seg>
<seg id="2822">By clicking the button Add... from the group machine to name resolution a DNS server can be added. it will be displayed in the New Name Server dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2823">First you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button. the entry will then be inserted in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2824">From the group computer to name resolution select one entry and then click on the Edit button.... The Edit dialog will display.</seg>
<seg id="2825">The list of names, known by name, describes the hostname-to-IP address reference for the TCP / IP subsystem. it is primarily used when booting when no DNS servers are available. in small, closed networks, it can replace DNS servers.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Usually the list of names contains some entries, the & apos; localhostapos; and some special IPv6 addresses. this version of IP still being tested will replace version 4 in the future.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Enter the IP address of the known computer and click Add... Adding New Alias dialog will be shown.</seg>
<seg id="2828">Enter the name of the known machine and click the Add button. if the well-known machine has multiple alias names, press the Add button several times and enter the other alias names.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Select an entry of a named hostname from the list and select Edit.... The dialog Modified Calculator will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2830">It can be done one of the following tasks, then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The settings made in the module network settings are not immediately effective in the system. to enable the changes, the following command must be set in a & Console.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The homepage of & knetworkconf; is http: / / knetworkconf.sourceforge.net, from which you can download the latest version of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For installation of binary distributions (usually rpm packages) it is enough if & kde; and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Installation of the pre-compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a & console; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a graphical user interface can be used as a kpackage or the installation tool of your distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2836">For this case the installation of Qt and & kde is enough; not, but additionally the development packages are needed with libraries and other things.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended only to experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile & knetwork.conf. the following commands should do this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information about basic network technology is given, in the second all of the configuration files are discussed in & knetworkconf.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This section cannot replace further knowledge about IP networks. in this appendix only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small (home) network is communicated.</seg>
<seg id="2840">There are currently IP networks operated with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv5 has never been widely distributed. IPv6 is expected to continue in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is knowing which IP address of a network interface is to be assigned. in external networks, at the & eg; workplace, the network administrator is the point of contact with a valid IP address or if available, DHCP can be used. in any case, the IP address can not be chosen arbitrarily!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up an own small (home) network, the IP address should be selected from a particular area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet, therefore any use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet can be enabled for such machines by setting a gateway.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, usually addresses are used in the range from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254. the area is big enough for networks up to 250 machines.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0, so that all hosts are nodes in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second is the loopback address (localhost = your own calculator). the default route is required for the IP forwarding.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The network address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine. normally, the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to its own so-called loopback interface, which operates like a closed circle.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& kdat; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar. it offers the possibility to store several archives on a tape. the first was to create a surface for tar, which additionally offered the ability of dds2tar for fast, selective unpacking. the second goal was to answer a question my wife asked: how much longer does it take when you secure?</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a band can be used, it must be bound by & dat; this can happen in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat; RST the tape back and read the pre-tensioning information of the tape. recognize & dat; the preload on the tape is not, you will be asked if the tape is to be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Recognizes & dat; the pre-tensioner, searches for the right index on your disk. if this cannot be found, you will be asked if the tape index is to be recreated.</seg>
<seg id="2897">When everything goes smoothly, the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape has been integrated. in the status bar, a corresponding message appears. the contents of the tape can now be browsed by folding the entry for the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before ejecting the tape, the integration must first be solved. there are three methods to accomplish this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& dat; indicates by changing the symbol for the band that the integration for the band has been solved and shows in the status bar a corresponding message. the band can now be ejected without danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a band of & dat; can be used, it must be formatted by & dat.</seg>
<seg id="2901">A bandage must be formatted before you can use to store data. this process does not correspond to the formatting in & dat; this process does not correspond to the formatting in & dat; this process does not correspond to the formatting in & dat; this process does not correspond to formatting in & dat; if your tape drive requires formatting before use, this must happen before you can be formatted before using. floppy tape drives usually require a formatting of the tape, but DAT drives do not.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the band name and the capacity, & dat saves; with the formatting of the tape. all data on the tape is lost! after completion of the formatting process, the tape is automatically mounted and ready for use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you initiate the backup process, you need to select the files to be secured. this can happen in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. only this file or folder will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Select a backup job in the tree. only the files specified in the profile will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Select files in the local file tree with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Right-click on the local file tree and select in the Save menu...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup has been started, the dialog opens Settings for Backup. in this dialog you can check once again the selected files and change the settings for backup.</seg>
<seg id="2909">If you have confirmed the settings dialog box will appear. the dialog shows the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the archives in the record for the drive. it will only check the selected file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders are checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Right-click in one of the archives and select the menu item...</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the test procedure has been started, the dialog box will appear for review. in this dialog you can review your selection and change the working folder for the review.</seg>
<seg id="2914">If you have confirmed the settings for the review, the dialog box will appear. this dialog shows the progress of the audit process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you can initiate the restore, the files that need to be restored must be selected. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives belonging to the record for the tape drive. it will only restore the selected file or subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Right-click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Restore....</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the restore process has been started, the Settings dialog appears. in this dialog you can review your selection and change the working folder for recovery.</seg>
<seg id="2920">When you confirm the restore settings, the Restore dialog appears. this dialog shows the progress of the restore process as well as the throughput and remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it is necessary to recreate the tape index file by means of the tape content. this process deletes all existing index files for this band. you can create the index on two types of the volume:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This will create a security profile with the currently selected files and the default settings. you can make the following settings for a backup job:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current job folder where the backup should take place. the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the selected workbook.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders that are listed under backup files, only the files located in the same file system are protected as the folder. folders that are on other filesystems can be entered separately under backup files. each entry is considered by tar independent of the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform an incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files that have changed since then are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Delete the snapshot file before the tar call. this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the buttons files & gt; & lt; files were not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">The settings can be set up from the menu item KDat... in the Settings menu. you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to the device file for the tape drive (normally / dev / tape). this path must point to the non-winding version of the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2931">This setting is active, conveys & dat; before the tape is mounted, the command mt load to the drive. in some drives this is necessary before reading or write operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is switched on, try & dat; to lock the ejection during tape drive. possibly this setting does not work on all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is turned on, if you want to connect & dat, the tape is automatically ejected. do not use this option with Floppy Streamers.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is turned on, try & dat; the hardware-sided block size for the tape drive. not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter if this setting is active or not, you must & kdat; in any case, share the block size for your tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & dat; a tape is formatted, it writes a file at the beginning of the tape. this file should only cover a memory block on the tape. the content of the file is composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n byte) The band ID. the format of this string is machine name: seconds, where hostname is the complete name of the system on which the tape was formatted. seconds is the number of seconds passed since the period in which the tape was formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the file $HOME / .kdat /.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The rest of the files on the tape are plain tar archives, which can be managed directly with & GNU; - tar. even other tar versions should work as long as they are not incremental backups.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the contents of a backup tape. this icon is only active when a band is involved.</seg>
<seg id="2940">& ksystemlogue; is a & kde; viewer for system logs. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system provides the various protocol files. furthermore, & ksystemlogue; experienced users can quickly access, for example, information on problems that occur on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlogue; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background. the task of & ksystemlogue; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system leaves the various protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & ksystemlogue; experienced users can quickly access, for example, information on problems that occur on their server. & kSystemlog; therefore attempts to provide some advanced features that can be filtered and evaluated by the protocol files of certain programs.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 has & ksystemlogue; a number of useful functions. this includes:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the Syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the other chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you see in the following screenshot, & ksystemlogue provides functions that can easily filter and sort the single protocol lines of a log file. the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the startup tries & ksystemlogue; first the most important log file of the system - the system protocol - to open. if you do not see it, and it opens up instead of it a small message window, you have usually not started with system administrator rights. the protocol files are usually found under Linux in the / var / log folder, for which normal users usually do not have permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter strip to filter by a selected criterion or by setting the string. in the default setting, the selection box next to the filter will display the entry All. in the default setting, the selection box next to the filter will show the entry All. then a protocol line will only be displayed if the string of the filter search term is contained in one of the columns.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select another entry at this point. the string of the filter search term will then only be compared to the entries in the selected column. for example, in the protocol file system log, select the process column process, and in addition, select the name of a process in the protocol file system log; all protocol lines indicate which were sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines. protocol lines of level errors are displayed with a more conspicuous color as a level critic. the color display of protocol lines can be switched off setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you only want to display a specific process (for example, in the system protocol or in the Cron protocol), you can show the process identification (PID) in the process column. this can be useful, for example, if you want to examine the output of a certain command such as the Samba server start. in this case, you can use filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can activate the option to new lines in the main window context menu to display all the new protocol lines that are added.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlogue; allows you to display multiple log files in separate subwindows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional subwindows. once you have selected a subwindow, select a log in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemloader; has its own website at http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org Dort you will find more current information about the sources of & ksystemlogue.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlogue; also find in the following folder of the & kde; -Subversion archive: ksystemlog; im & kde; -archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and in the following also named) as & ksysv; This section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The system V Init is quickly becoming the standard for controlling the program starts when the system starts up in the & Linux world. it is because it is easier to use, more powerful, and more flexible than the traditional BSD-Init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go into historical aspects here (e.g. because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binary file is under / bin and not under / etc. this is important because maybe someone might try to switch a machine to System V Init without needing to reinstall and reformat. therefore, you need to make sure that the old Init was removed from there if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init also differs from the BSD Init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc instead of directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.sysinit and the following additional folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a lot of scripts. basically you need a script for each system service you want to run when you start the system or when you switch to another run level. system services do not contain such things as Network, NFS, & Sendmail; or httpd & etc; system services do not contain such things as setserial, which is only started once. such calls are according rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be under / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if there is not much use for it. you can also create a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run a serial port on the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel scans in different places after the program init and starts the first one it finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default Runlevel is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line in the initial range as the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point, you can take a look into the second column and probably notice that the default Runlevel 3 is. if you want to change this, you can edit / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. if you have messed up something, then you can repair it by restarting the system and running the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start all the correct scripts? if you enter ls -l in rc3.d then you probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no real files in this folder. instead, each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How does and stop init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument such as start and stop. you can actually start these scripts by hand on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if it contains a K, the script will be invoked with the argument stop. if it contains an S, the script will be called with the argument start.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could & eg; have a server running level that only runs httpd, & Sendmail;, Network & etc. in addition, I could also have a user runtime, that & eg; & kdm;, network & etc; starts.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you will learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Using & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointing device is simple to not say trivial: just drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six Runlevel to start it at this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between runleveln or change the position within a level by dragging it somewhere else. this happens only if they pull out an entry from the range of available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are moved if you drag them into a new section. to copy them only to a new Runlevel, you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert it into the target area -- even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before attempting to insert the system service again.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: currently there is no way to restore items thrown in the recycle bin. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the Tab key to activate the different working ranges (Verfügbare Systemdienste, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection top or below the previous one.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry to another runlevel, move it with cut into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and insert it into the desired Runlevel with insert (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually, press the Enter key to switch the Properties dialog. use the Tab key to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the Enter key to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the File menu require a confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. presets are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise, they are restored by & ksysv; changes to the default settings are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimented with the standard runleveln, and now the machine is constantly restarting. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO prompt linux single and press the Enter key to start in single-use mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default runtime level to a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services with & ksysv; provided under Runlevel X but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using & SuSE; or Delix (DLD) then you need to edit additional files in / etc that exist only in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way system services are started in these distributions simplifies configuration for the proprietary alignment programs of these distributions, but unfortunately does not conform to any standard. the authors of & ksysv are planning an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using a different distribution: please check if all configuration files are available that are required by the respective system service (and whether they are in the right directory). some services (such as eg; Apache or httpd) simply terminate without notice if their configuration files are not present or wrongly set up.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The meaning of the & Linux; runtime varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you are using a different distribution please send me information about the runtime to be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To begin with & kuser; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of & kuser; to read.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you have made changes, you need to save it. either you use the appropriate icon of the toolbar or the Save in the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two cards, the user and the user group list. to edit, select the desired user or the desired group with a double click on the entry.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some cards are displayed only if you have advanced system settings. only if you have limited space restrictions (quota) for users, a card card is created on which you can make individual settings. other cards appear, if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The card password management appears, if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card only appears if space restriction (quota) is activated and initialized for at least one embedded file system (quota user / quota group on the filesystem). here, parameters can be changed for each user, where the limited space limitations are in KB:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each filesystem. the current filesystem is selected using the field file system with restricted space limitation</seg>
<seg id="2997">The group of cards informs about the group affiliations of the selected user. the standard group, to which the user belongs, can be found in the Primary group. furthermore, the user can be a member of other groups by marking them in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The group dialog features a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select Add from the Users or Group menu or click the appropriate Add button on the toolbar. editing or deleting the selected user respectively the selected group works similarly.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module you can install the LILO System Manager, add, remove and change boot password, change time to boot of the default operating system, add the default operating system, remove, change operating systems, remove, change and more.</seg>
