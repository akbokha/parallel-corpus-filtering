although I had visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year , I would live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extra@@ ordinarily great .
like many of my generation , I grew up with American movies , d@@ anced to American music , read American authors and run his sport .
in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly journalist because of an American film .
as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington playing the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Peli@@ can L@@ etter , a fear@@ less journalist who , with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts , uncovered the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of an oil mag@@ n@@ ate who wanted to occupy the top federal court with judges who were inclined to his interest .
I was trapped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; free to Method Man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was , as if it is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year that I lived in Arizona was only ampli@@ fied by my admir@@ ation for the USA .
I always said : &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people .
I even had a very black@@ ish love letter written about its size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much has been written about x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me , how he is dealing with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
he never stops behind the mountain , as you say so nicely .
he says exactly what he thinks , how a former colleague expressed it , and publicly declares his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , African @-@ Americans and women .
nevertheless , the people responded to his statements and tuned in dro@@ ves for him .
the 13 million votes he won in the Republi@@ can election was the highest number that a candidate nominated by the party ever reached .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ ot person , I asked myself ?
I could not reconci@@ le Tr@@ ump and his voters with the people I had met in Phoenix during my time .
for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program that embra@@ ces people from all over the world , a deeply beli@@ ever person with whom I could talk about Islam and his past .
Tr@@ um@@ ps Wel@@ tan@@ schauung , too , did not agree with Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current publisher of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er . &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
Tr@@ um@@ ps Int@@ oler@@ ance is also in contrast to the gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who fought the environment for a long time , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like her son .
she still fits the dedication of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me with much patience and grace and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life .
then there were Andrew Leck@@ ey , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise counsel helped me a lot in my career .
these people and the values em@@ bodied by them deep@@ ened my love for America .
while Tr@@ ump pi@@ er@@ ced his way to the nominated Republi@@ can presidential candidate , they offered me a stop and the counter@@ part to his limited vision of America .
it turned out however that they were the exception of the rule .
on November 8 , 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly wh@@ ites , gave the pres@@ idency to a man despite - or perhaps precisely because of his cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people .
the confrontation with the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump because they either shared his rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ cism or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart .
perhaps it is unfair to design@@ ate the Tr@@ ump voters as ra@@ cists .
to classi@@ fy people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is super@@ ficial and dis@@ respect@@ ful , and implies an inability to understand those who act in a different way .
it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
could it be that these voters , most of whom are white , voted for Tr@@ ump because they want to reg@@ ain control over a country that has disappointed them ?
in other words , would they perhaps say that they are still important in this America ?
maybe . maybe .
however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comment@@ ates on the cruel decision to raise a man looking down with cont@@ emp@@ t upon those who look different from him .
this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( note , D. Ü ) : as much as &quot; rebellion of the wh@@ ites against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities . &quot; word play from white in all@@ usion to the white and whi@@ plas@@ h , as the great Van Jones described , just killed what America has done so splen@@ did@@ ly .
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality , it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which belief or background one may have , America is welcome everyone .
for this country chose as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose story as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible .
but with the election of Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps there is a huge portion of the white America of this promise , saying : to hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 the white man is again at the helm , they say .
in all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
at a rally for H@@ illary Clinton Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd .
Donald Tr@@ ump , would my son , Captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan .
the crowd responded with a loud &quot; no ! &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; the crowd ro@@ ared .
&quot; have Lat@@ inos a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they answered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do A@@ fr@@ o Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they called and their voices became lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if someone , who is not like you , would have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; NO &quot; !
Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , this is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the land for whom his son fell , sent him a message .
this is Tr@@ um@@ ps Country , said the news .
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan could find no room in this new America .
and that will break my heart .

out of misery to the stars : these Latin American children don &apos;t let their love for music spoil by rub@@ b@@ ish
the &quot; Recycl@@ ed Instruments Orchestra &quot; by C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay , during a concert in Washington DC .
image of OE@@ A @-@ O@@ AS ( CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 ) .
what has the Mexican music school of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero church in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca together with the children of the Paragu@@ ay@@ an city of C@@ ate@@ ura together ?
that the music played in both places has not only changed the lives of children , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the waste
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large land@@ fill , only 16 Kilomet@@ ers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial town which is very popular among tourists -@@ but worlds apart from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous kitchen .
for some years now La b@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( music band ) has played in the community : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which has found a way to overcome poverty surrounding it with their musical instruments .
a music school with 100 students has become a central interest to the community of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the municipality located in one of Mexico &apos;s poor@@ est provinces is known for its use of drugs and the use of gangs .
but this changed after a coinci@@ dental encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and gave the youth a rare hope of hope .
the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , the local press No@@ tici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI writes :
as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .
you are always smiling and playing with gle@@ aming eyes and playing in the bu@@ stle you can learn day by day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , o@@ bo@@ e , flute , forest horn , tim@@ pani , bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga .
music from Wa@@ ste
more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of C@@ ate@@ ur@@ ura - a village that is situated on the top of the biggest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material :
music with re@@ manufactured instruments , consisting of local solid waste materials , produced in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the recycl@@ ers under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez have begun to turn parts of the waste into instruments .
the instruments mim@@ ic viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cel@@ los , double bass , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and percussion , all of which have been made from rub@@ b@@ ish .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra etc .
in an article from the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and musician of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , re@@ members the early days :
first it was very difficult because we had no room for rehear@@ sals and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the garbage . the kids didn &apos;t know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children .
this changed as F@@ avi@@ o something he had never seen before : a violin made from waste .
today , there is a whole orchestra playing instruments of recycled material and which is called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a documentary called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; records the musical performance : &quot; &quot; &quot;
every year , the world generates approximately one billion tons of tr@@ ash .
those who live with him and from him are the poor@@ est - as the people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they turn him into something beautiful .
land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspiring spectacle of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music all around the world .
the orchestra performed his music even before Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team@@ work can successfully fight illegal fishing
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that comb@@ ats wild illegal fishing .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports about international , practical solutions for environmental issues .
the re @-@ release takes place as part of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for the shared use of content .
in West Africa it was known then that this ship had already used illegal fishing in Liberia &apos;s waters before it sought the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were so upset and reluc@@ tant to welcome a criminal of this kind on their coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ os , Moz@@ ambique and the Seych@@ elles quickly mobili@@ zed against the ship . they refused to buy one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing permit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bene@@ dict Ki@@ il@@ u , a leading employee of the Ken@@ yan fish@@ eries authority , is part of a team that discovered and tra@@ cked the ship . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : he was not able to catch fish there .
in the end , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia , because of the pl@@ under@@ ing of the country &apos;s fish stocks .
the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , founded in 2012 by NGO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Stop Il@@ legal fishing ) .
in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are the six countries who then had driven the prime ministers from their waters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded and work together . they exchange information and compete with each other where it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , Director of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , therefore it is extremely difficult to track down . thus , illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing regions .
due to the deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws by which certain habitats and species are to be protected , the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems can harm ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance .
but while actions against illegal fishing were once ham@@ pered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les , and even through the sn@@ ail , with the information between individual countries , the actions happen nowadays in real time , trac@@ eable to F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there , for example , the individual countries can exchange listings of existing licenses , news on suspi@@ cious activities or details that one notices or experienced during a port inspection .
fish @-@ i also atten@@ tively tracks the activities of ships , if they move on the open sea , via satellite data .
this makes it possible for the authorities to identify ships that fish in forbidden areas . such suspi@@ cious travel routes can also be discovered - such as those indic@@ ative that a ship loads its caught fish on the road to other ships .
ideally , such investigations show whether the participating vessels have a fishing license where they were on the way and whether they have a criminal record .
countries that are against illegal fishing can refuse to accept such ships in their ports on the basis of this information , which means that the ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced to pay pen@@ alties , as in the case of the prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then there are substantial financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is financially ir@@ relevant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and that &apos;s what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , Managing Director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting firm dedicated to the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a closed front
the so @-@ called platform was created to reg@@ ain an estimated $ 20 million in lost revenue , which the eight members of the H@@ ISH @-@ i network will lose each year because of the illegal fishermen who enter into East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fish@@ eries , which is why the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world .
their practices include actions such as sailing under false flag , counter@@ f@@ eit licensing , speci@@ fying fanta@@ sies , fishing of protected species and fishing in nature reserves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; take advantage of the lack of international cooperation and take advantage of the weaknesses of a non @-@ seamless control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , a ship could fish illegal and a country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You cannot run my port . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but another country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Come to Me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and this legal lo@@ op@@ hole tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so far the closed front works .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspi@@ cious ships .
it has uncovered criminal networks that had distributed fake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used multiple frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has tra@@ cked and found escap@@ ing ships .
due to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority to combat crime , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing across large distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organized crime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he builds a system that aims to help F@@ ISH @-@ i locate suspi@@ cious ships more precisely .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly being developed , also helps to detect the illegal vessels that are happy to hide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ g@@ g M@@ at Tracking , an NGO , who also deals with fish@@ eries data and provides F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships turn off their automatic identification systems , so they can no longer be ordered by satellites .
Cop@@ eland therefore helps to build a system that connects different levels of information . F@@ ISH @-@ i will help to find criminal operating ships with greater precision .
a model program
but can F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations really influence the undou@@ b@@ ted global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes this .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the Global Fishing Tour platform with Google and the Oce@@ ana Marine Environment Agency : a platform that provides satellite data and can be displayed anywhere in the world by means of the position of each tracking vessel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with the neighbors , to get a better picture of who is doing - that simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and to bundle their resources to investigate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust has a similar project in which a global system allows the persecution of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities not only detect criminals , but also deter them .
ships that were previously conf@@ is@@ cated without license and hardly had consequences , now know that they are being watched .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries involved at F@@ ISH @-@ i have now a 33 % increase in fisher@@ y turnover since fishing boats buy more licenses .
after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia had helped to detect Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found there on board tow@@ ing nets , whose use is prohibited .
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that other countries now also copy us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have become an object of study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa , several hundred million dollars disappear every year through illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 six countries joined together , to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they are also fighting illegal fishing , after exactly the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; With certainty , the goal is to create even more such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member country Somalia was able to announce its first big triumph : in October Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship sailing under false flag . and not only did the ship travel without licence and were used tow@@ ing nets , which are now banned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ship was also inv@@ aded into forbidden waters reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking measures against Gre@@ ko 1 is a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ber@@ gh says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ ISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time the proof that such a special , collaborative approach to protecting the oceans is actually working throughout the oceans .

their articles appear in the Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , the New York Times and the Guardian . situation in Venezuela is escal@@ ating further : demonstrations in several cities with the goal of &quot; re@@ covering the country &quot;
street movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are regarded as a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on the removal of President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .
this picture by María Ale@@ j@@ andra Mor@@ a shows a close @-@ up of the demonstration in Mar@@ ac@@ ai@@ bo in 2014 .

after the government &apos;s government rejected the opposition &apos;s request for a referendum on a referendum , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans responded , in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into the void while congreg@@ ating on the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ Dec@@ Venezuela ( for example : the refund of Venezuela ) both pictures of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them can be found .
the debate is also being conducted in other parts of the country - among others in the Bar@@ inas area , in the An@@ de@@ an regions Mé@@ ri@@ da and T@@ á@@ chir@@ a , in the central north @-@ north of the Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on the Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the country &apos;s political and economic situation is continuously wor@@ sen@@ ing what makes itself felt in the everyday life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an acute lack of food and medicines .
many representatives of the opposition saw the chance of a fundamental change in the removal of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro , but ultimately , the holding of a new election was blocked by official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , Con@@ tri@@ but@@ ors at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ ises in their latest article the context of the government decision as follows :
in the context of the social , political and economic crisis , in which the rate of inflation and violence belong to the highest in the whole world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % to the end of the year ) and in which a grave and widespread lack of food and medicine exists , the referendum was considered to be the only way to give the country the chance to rec@@ ap@@ ture its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance .
the electoral alliance Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democ@@ r@@ á@@ tica or MU@@ D ( roughly : round Table of the Democratic Unit ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups joined together , urged the demonstr@@ ators to participate in the campaign against President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro . in addition , a twelve @-@ hour strike on the Fol@@ get@@ ag and a march to Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace , the Venezu@@ el@@ an government , should continue to pers@@ ist in office .
the call was commented on Twitter , among other things , as follows :
it is as far as Venezuela : tomorrow National Assembly , Friday nationwide civilian strike and on the 3rd of November all to Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace .

&quot; the reg@@ ression of Venezuela &quot;
the first demonstration in the context of the Action Programme &quot; The Con@@ trac@@ ting of Venezuela &quot; took place on Wednesday , October 26 .
the images of the mar@@ ches published in real time testify among other things an overwhelming participation of the people in numerous areas of the country , but also confron@@ tations with polic@@ emen and supporters of the government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one of the most often shared pictures shows a demonstr@@ ator who is calling through the shiel@@ ds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you kill me because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you kill me because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cri@@ es out this Venezu@@ el@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot;

on Twitter , images accum@@ ulate from confron@@ tations , as well as reports of oppression and abuse .
especially large waves beat the news of police repression in the centrally located town of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local cathedral to protect themselves according to their own statement in front of the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government .
hours later they could safely leave the cathedral , but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop police forces , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an State T@@ á@@ chir@@ a :
the women in T@@ á@@ chir@@ a don &apos;t wear skir@@ ts , because otherwise you could see something that many National Gu@@ ards do not have !
meanwhile , an inf@@ ographic already makes the round that forms the level of repression per day :
thus the dictatorship has supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government had challenged the validity of the demand for a ten@@ ure procedure - this has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the streets .
my@@ stic &apos;s Media Lab@@ s for this :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ dado claim that 1 % of signatures are counter@@ f@@ eit .
here is your ten@@ ure of office !
on the road !
others are evaluating these protests as a further step in the fight against a government that has taken little against the disa@@ strous economic crisis and pre@@ fers to let critical voices be stopped :
they took us so much - but also fear !
the mar@@ ches are increasing in frequency and intensity .
some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported the media that they were too hungry to participate in a strike , rather than work or go shopping .

this is an adapted version of an interview by Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on August 23 , 2016 on D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argent@@ ine@@ an news page .
the interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to see the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine city of Cór@@ doba .
as an adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano now said to his father as part of the great La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera trial in the province of Cór@@ doba .
in the trial which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were being investigated that were committed during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not chosen his life .
starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father up to the brutal military operations in the prison La Per@@ la , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
for 34 years he kept his family secret .
in the situation at that time I thought that was all right .
I felt like a secret agent .
as a child with 15 years , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
at that time I could not see that my father was a th@@ ief , tor@@ turer and mur@@ derer .
Luis Alberto had no choice : his father , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano , was gendar@@ mer@@ ie . during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father was the Deputy Commander of the Intelligence Department 141 in La Per@@ la prison .

but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the oppres@@ sor , accused of kidn@@ apping in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and kidn@@ apping of a 10 @-@ year @-@ old child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os son , a man who , over the years , recognized the extent of atro@@ cities he had witnessed as a boy , and who testified before a federal court against his own father .
his story shows the great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose a way of salvation .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall with us . there I was friends with a boy who made martial arts .
all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ and @-@ white photo and asked me to identify my friend on it .
he said :
you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you have been friends with one of the ERP .

so he for@@ ba@@ de me to go back to the gymn@@ asi@@ um . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
he told me I would become a secret agent .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be ok . for so my father had educated me .
on the military base , I had to destroy papers which had belonged to the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , simply everything .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prisoners are tor@@ tured &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la - everything in 1976 .
at the first and last time he let me wait in the car at the entrance .
when he took me the second time , he told me to get off . he led me to a bar@@ rack in which cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - just everything possible - stood .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a small package wrapped in a blanket and told me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big l@@ ump of silver inside .
on that day I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks where the stolen objects were par@@ ked and kept me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
I saw in and saw a couch where people were tor@@ tured .
she looked like a field bed and metal springs .
later I found out that they attached it to the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was tied there .
they rarely tied a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , over@@ laid it with water and hun@@ ted him 220 volts in the gen@@ itals .

the sten@@ ch there was app@@ alling ... like a dirty wind .
years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room .
I recognized the smell immediately and it became clear to me that this is the smell of a body in need .
I could never forget this smell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I asked myself : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how is it possible for a person to do so much harm to another ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ i knew that these people were killed
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were bound and bound with hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
he spoke with &quot; Chu@@ bi &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilian also indic@@ ted in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background , I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked men lay down with the face down@@ wards - all were captiv@@ ated by hands and feet .
in the vicinity of the entrance , people stood still on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why do you look , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why did you bring me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed by soldiers .
I know this because my father told me about it at home .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , there were some rooms that were designated as offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rom@@ ero struck a man there and killed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( according to survivors , the Zi@@ vi@@ list Jor@@ ge Rom@@ ero , who was also indic@@ ted in the La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial , checked the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death ) .
in the following video , Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , the director of the La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former torture chambers .
the way you came here is also the way where the ab@@ duc@@ ted came here .
if you look at the map , you will see that they took approximately this path and then were tor@@ tured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ isation .
when they survived torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ bic@@ ra until the order from above came to be mis@@ placed .
this was the lie - eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of men and the dis@@ appearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; spo@@ ils of war &apos;
my father brought home all possible stolen stuff .
at that time at the age I had no idea what the &quot; boot@@ y &quot; - as they called it - was .
but when I was in the military myself later - I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that war yield is a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military signs that are taken against an enemy that was fought .

but when one walks into a house and ste@@ als the fridge , record player , clothes , painting , money ... then this is not a boot@@ y but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I have always wonder@@ ed how my father , the leader of the security forces , could participate in this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand .
I was also an officer in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never have liked to enter a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
once he called me a criminal and I answered : and you , who is driving cars on the street ?
you are not a criminal ?
he explo@@ ded with anger , struck me and cried :
if you go so far , then I will find you and kill you stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly .
we don &apos;t need anyone else to do that !
this is my father .
I have not a single good memory of him .
when I said in the process , I showed a photo of then , on which I wore a jacket and a roll collar jum@@ per of wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still brought clothes at home .
at that time , the defense of a con@@ spir@@ ator accused me of being a con@@ spir@@ ator in this crime . I replied , no problem , they can put me to the burden whatever they wanted .
I was there anyway to say .
&apos;@@ the dis@@ appearance of cor@@ p@@ ses is the last abom@@ in@@ able act &apos;
now that I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se .
I have children . once you have children , you recognize the value of a life .
one continues to develop and realize that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , you have executed people during the dictatorship , but why should the bodies disappear ?
why do children dance ?
one day my father brought a girl home , whose mother had been killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
I always asked myself the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
it would have been possible to put them in jail .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people , but why should their bodies disappear ?
did these people not even have families that could be handed over to their mortal remains ?
the dis@@ appearance of cor@@ p@@ ses is the last abom@@ in@@ able act that man can do to a human being .
my father told me when democracy was introduced again , they took machines to eliminate the mortal remains of the prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they were crushed and dispos@@ ed of somewhere - no idea where . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but something always remains forever .
&apos;@@ i &apos;ve seen how you killed people ! &apos;
just to make it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 criminals , including my father .
the idea of showing my father was born during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I made him repro@@ aches because of all the atro@@ cities I had to experience because of him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt in@@ war@@ dly rejected and asked me why all the exagger@@ ated patrio@@ tism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings , &quot; which they supposedly defended , were actually good .
then I cried out :
how can you tell me about this ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed aw@@ ful crimes and you forced me as a child to participate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he just replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , don &apos;t show me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
in 2010 I issued the first ad .
I finally realized that he was a criminal .
no one can reproach me that I am pre@@ ju@@ dic@@ ed . I have finally testified against my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest pending before the end of the trial .
he was charged with 4@@ 16 crimes , including severe , illegal de@@ priv@@ ation of liberty in 158 cases , torture in 154 cases , murder in 98 particularly severe cases , torture followed by a death sequence in five cases and a case of kidn@@ apping of a child under 10 years old .

the judgments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the magnitude of the judgment in Spanish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after four years , in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial ended due to the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 against 7@@ 16 victims finally in August .
43 Supp@@ res@@ sors were found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases , the Court sentenced to life imprisonment and in nine cases sentence pen@@ alties between 2 and 14 years . in six cases there were acqu@@ itt@@ als .
eleven of the original 54 def@@ end@@ ants died during the trial .
# La@@ Perm : murder , torture and rape by officials .
all the accused were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police officers and civilian personnel .
Pier@@ o De Monti was kidn@@ apped along with his pregnant wife in June 1976 and transferred to La Per@@ la .
he addressed the following words to the silent chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory conceived by in@@ human heads .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court ruling is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations who have worked for years on justice for the victims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , founded in 1995 , who represents the children of people murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said :
the process took more than three years , but the search for it took 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government handed over the country on which La Per@@ la was located to establish a memorial site , which is now being run by human rights organisations .

&quot; &quot; &quot; a translation error makes older people in K@@ YO@@ TO a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible car &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sign with the translation error at a center in Kyoto , in which you can extend your driving license .
the photo was spread in the social media .
editing the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can pro@@ long one &apos;s driving licence were witnesses of a very badly mis@@ interpreted translation last month .
on a sign the Japanese word was wrong@@ ly translated as &quot; older mot@@ orists &quot; - but perhaps also with malicious h@@ ind thanks &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; aw@@ ful mot@@ orists &quot; translated .
the false translation was to be read on electronic displays in the entrance area and in the building itself from 1 to 20 September .
editing the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine , which has been widely shared in the social media .
the mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a citizen of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers .
the Kyoto newspaper Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n , which has been published in Kyoto , wrote :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an insul@@ t to elderly people and in an international city like Kyoto simply unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the &quot; terrible drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; aw@@ ful drivers &quot; ) was later replaced by the appropriate , if gram@@ mati@@ cally not quite correct designation &quot; elder drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) .
the Kyoto Pre@@ f@@ ecture did not ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the translation error . furthermore , she explained that the error was already contained in the text she had received by the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported about the ap@@ ology :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are sincer@@ ely sorry that elderly people felt insul@@ ted by inadequate correction ( translation ) on our part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News dealt with the phenomenon of &quot; fear@@ ful &quot; older mot@@ orists in Japan and wrote :
the word &quot; aw@@ ful &quot; has been den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of elderly mot@@ orists . according to the police , the proportion of elderly mot@@ orists who are involved in accidents across the country is quite a matter of concern .
in the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of total 19,@@ 460 accidents were caused by sen@@ iors in 2005 . this corresponds to a proportion of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , senior citizens convic@@ ted 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents .
as a result , their share rose to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has decreased overall , the share of accidents caused by sen@@ iors has risen in the same period .
in the version of the article published on Yahoo , the particularly un@@ named repor@@ ter showed comments on light that show what prejudi@@ ces some Japanese seemingly like against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo for translation errors has among other things received the following comments :
- &quot; Is this ( &quot; aw@@ ful mot@@ orists &quot; ) about not the reality ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How bad is translation not at all , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
- &quot; I don &apos;t think that &apos;s a real translation error . &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a real treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre errors in English .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Andrew .
the reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold .
for transl@@ ating , one needs two important skills : passive language skills to understand the original text and active language skills to translate it into the target language .
the latter requires the active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . generally , the conviction is that translators in the target language - not in the original language - should be native speakers .
for example , a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French to English .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ English as their native language , which could produce translations into English . this may be due to a lack of understanding of translation , cost reasons or the relatively low number of English native speakers who learn Japanese .
some companies that do not have foreign employees leave translations within the company . then the Japanese staff , whose English skills are rated as the best , are made translators - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
machine translations are also widespread - often with funny results .
the verb@@ alized and mysterious sentences that arise through machine translation indicate that this technique cannot yet replace a human translator . this is especially true for some languages .
some of the stran@@ gest English phrases in Japan , including the mysterious prints that often ad@@ orn t @-@ shirts or bags , are used only for styli@@ stic reasons - not to be read or even understood .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless . however , by large companies or by the government who have the means to ensure higher standards , more accurate translations can be expected .
in the future , the City of Kyoto will hopefully use a more rep@@ utable source of its translations .
Venezuela : recording protests and cens@@ orship measures on the internet and television
homepage of the portal &quot; Nav@@ as@@ egar con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; ( Free surfing ) of IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , 7 April , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users announced that they had no access to Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay online .
other users later wrote that the internet presentations of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Cap@@ it@@ oli@@ o TV are no longer accessible .
other online broad@@ cast@@ ers also survived photographs of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as organized by op@@ posi@@ tional groups opposing the government of Nicol@@ ás Ma@@ du@@ ros .
the protests started in early April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself .
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author of Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ te . he pointed out that the connection was c@@ apped and advised the users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# cens@@ orship : enable your VPN .
it seems that the web pages of Venezu@@ el@@ an providers are locked again .
this is from the side of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with the Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
traditional media have been reluc@@ tant to report protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission for T@@ elecommunic@@ ations threatened them with fin@@ es and closures if they continued to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw it as a &quot; call to violence . &quot;
without cable TV and informative national TV channels , I have registered at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net again .
it is amazing that it is still cheaper than buying two litres of lem@@ on@@ ade .
the local NGO , VE@@ IT , later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible through a blocking of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online channels . this also applies to the website where the National Assembly transfers its sessions .
previous research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique through which the DNS servers respond correctly to certain domains .
if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server rep@@ lies or refuses the request when calling such a website .
we confirm a DNS @-@ lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third locked channel , the broadcast was dis@@ continued on Thursday , 6 April , when the V@@ PI@@ TV cam@@ er@@ aman El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who transferred the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as , was arrested .
Flor@@ es was beaten as he was in police custody .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went on air again .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it has also been reported that the government regul@@ ates Internet connections : this makes the Venezu@@ el@@ ans more difficult to access multimedia reporting about current events in the country .
in Paraguay , many girls become slaves to receive education
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta as a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today , T@@ ina fights for the rights of children and g@@ athers testim@@ onies of other Cri@@ adi@@ ans who have been victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated version of a report of cur@@ ative , published by Global Vo@@ ices with the kind permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Esc@@ u@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; Flying cows , falling schools &quot; ) edited and re @-@ released by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America .
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with her family who lived there .
shortly before her gradu@@ ation from university she returned to the house once more and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she , from whom something has become , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old , she began to work as a Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ adi@@ ta , in Paraguay the more than 46@@ ,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the business is quite simple : a large family with little money transfers their under@@ age son or their under@@ age daughter to another , more rich family . in exchange , the child receives food , a training and a roof over the head .
but what is not mentioned here is that children have to pay for countless days of house@@ work that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse can be - and all this within the framework of a treaty that cannot be lifted .
this practice referred to as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is widespread in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance of large parts of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organizations .
after gradu@@ ating , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a couple of years for an organization fighting for the rights of boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ ta - especially young girls are affected by the practice of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and den@@ ounced .
she tried to call things by name , because the feeling of gratitude that is in@@ oc@@ ulated to the cri@@ tically guarantees in general silence .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
on the one hand , there is the family , who have their daughter in the belief that they complete their education , improve their position in society , and &quot; make something out of themselves , &quot; to another family .
on the other hand , the family who as@@ simil@@ ates the girl and justi@@ fies her exploitation with faith is that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and perhaps even star@@ ved .
victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is ill @-@ treated , his family will learn about it many years later .
sometimes they never know about it .
in January 2016 , the previously unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the hidden in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , got a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín came to hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed traces of severe be@@ atings . shortly thereafter she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was in the household of Tom@@ ás F@@ errei@@ ra and his wife , Ram@@ ona Mel@@ gar@@ ej@@ o , who works as a civil servant in the Einwohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt .
Mar@@ ín lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
at the end of January 2016 , F@@ errei@@ ra had a stick on Mar@@ ín until she suffered fatal injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later the media reported on the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations like UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela bl@@ amed the practices of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go deeply rooted in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society for the death of the girl .
they marked the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people gathered in protest demonstrations and demanded that there should be &quot; no other Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widely used in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay , more cows are registered than children , &quot; said T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
without papers , it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of the couple and almost 60 civil society organisations called for a prompt investigation of the case .
they want Tom@@ ás F@@ errei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ gar@@ ej@@ o to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
if the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be landmark - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go will be brought to court .
the life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
the Cri@@ adi@@ ta are not only exploited as labour , they also live isolated from other girls at their age .
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ mer , in which her father worked , had to sign up bank@@ rupt@@ cy and her father lost his work .
her brothers had to work all the way and started selling sweets on the street or on the market to earn money .
but they all went to school .
only T@@ ina was sent as Cri@@ adi@@ ta to the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
in the house of her employers , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day .
she had to share the time in such a way that she still had time to learn .
she got up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared breakfast for her employer .
for example , they cleaned the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor .
when the school was over , she went home again and had time to learn .
the more she finished learning , the more free time she had .
but also this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but didn &apos;t get unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to bring more books from the library of the landlord as food out of the fridge , &quot; she re@@ members .
the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iser of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party that was in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
at some evenings the landlord Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced to stand next to him and read edi@@ tori@@ als from opposition newspapers such as &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot;
he tried to convince them not to believe in the official media reports about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he thought it intelli@@ gently but did not pause with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the host found someone who listened while talking about politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they didn &apos;t allow me to visit my family because they thought that I would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; learn bad habits &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they said that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , who belongs to the indigenous group of Guar@@ an@@ í , would return home to his mother tongue Guar@@ an@@ í . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their gent@@ leman feared that she would lose the education she had allowed her to lose , she explains .
she was fully aware that she had paid for everything she got from them with her hard work .
even at school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discrimin@@ ated against . &quot; one thing that is almost never talked about is mo@@ b@@ bing and har@@ ass@@ ment being exposed to cri@@ tically when they go to school .
because the other children have parents , they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents is a Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone home . I had no friends at school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , at the time when friend@@ ships arise , I felt particularly clear that I belonged to no group .
isolation was the worst of all , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
society Ap@@ proves the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can share job advertisements for cleaning staff and pa@@ edi@@ atri@@ cians in Paraguay .
the group &apos;s administration is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a town coun@@ cill@@ or in the As@@ unci@@ ón district .
hello ! I am looking for a little companion for my little daughter who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
to learn .
please contact me .
starting from Monday , if possible .

bill introduces Egyptian users of social media to register with the government
image of Pix@@ ab@@ ay , altered by Global Vo@@ ices .
published under Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
sixty Egyptian MPs recently agreed to draft legislation on &quot; regulating the use and use of social networks . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is accepted by the Parliament , users of social media in Egypt must register with a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law , a place would be set up , which is tas@@ ked with granting citizens a permit to use social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
within six months of adoption of the law , users on the site should register with their proper names and identity card numbers to be able to use social networks .
if it fails to do so , it could result in a penalty of up to six months &quot; imprisonment or a cash flow .
the bill , which consists of six paragra@@ phs and cur@@ ses in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; any application running across the Internet and used to communicate with others by voice , video tut@@ oring and text . &quot;
it is unclear how the law is en@@ forced when it is adopted , as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities should make registration for users . unclear is also how they should account for those who do not register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not able to ensure regulation at the level of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , MP and promot@@ er of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a username and password from the Ministry of T@@ elecommunic@@ ations to get through the fire@@ wall that blocks Facebook . &quot;
this could mean that Egypt plans to build a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . because of which it would be necessary for Egyptians and Egyptians to file information about their identity in order to access the network .
but it has not been known until now that such plans exist .
experts on site are scep@@ tical about the technical feasibility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; Senior Research Techni@@ cian &quot; ) at the Egyptian initiative for Human Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices :
I strongly doubt the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things that have to do with technology .
in my opinion , they imagine that just as they viol@@ ently control physical public and private spaces , it could also be done online .
if I take them seriously , it means they will set up a strong monitoring system to filter citizens that seek approval or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor people &apos;s activities and also to lead them to a court process .
this is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed with the legislature and the constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate .
whether its acceptance and enforcement will succeed or not , the draft &quot; stands in line with a pro @-@ military way of thinking in parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ized and assured that there is no aber@@ ration on the image surface , &quot; says Ra@@ o of .
last year , the parliamentary representative Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a bill against cy@@ ber crime in which a life @-@ long prison sentence was intended for those who were found guilty of &quot; threatening public order &quot; and &quot; to protest . &quot;
how a Kurdish natural guard protects the Persian le@@ op@@ ard in the war @-@ drawn Iraq

high up in the mountains of Kur@@ dist@@ an region in the north east of Iraq , the animal prot@@ ector H@@ ana Ah@@ med R@@ aza and her team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq are working on protecting the gh@@ ost@@ ly Persian le@@ op@@ ards .
a sub@@ species of the le@@ op@@ ards , which strike through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . in total , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are endangered due to po@@ aching , the loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat and since they find less and less loo@@ t .
why is this particular type of le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; as R@@ aza shows in the video , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Persian le@@ op@@ ard is the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ or in the Kurdish ecosystem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on a large pre@@ dat@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard in the wild bo@@ ar is low and goes against zero . as the team in the video thus determines that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera , R@@ aza stops in sheer joy .
as a trained bi@@ ologist , R@@ aza is passion@@ ately fond of another side of her country , which is not only of war and conflict .
she has been involved in field studies on wild animals and educational programs by Nature Iraq for six years .
since 2013 , it has been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group and is committed to ensuring that protected areas for wildlife in the Kur@@ dist@@ an region are established .

in early March 2017 , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , responsible for North East Japan , documented the progress achieved over the past six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the &quot; triple catastrophe &quot; of March 2011 . a massive earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an Atom@@ ic accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had caused the disaster .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , located in the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was a number of pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures in Japan &apos;s Nor@@ theast , which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were sev@@ ent@@ een ev@@ acu@@ ated because the ts@@ un@@ ami had caused whole coastal towns to disappear from the map .
in addition , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture experienced an atomic accident , already on its own account that 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o &apos;s special report shows from the local point of view what progress has been achieved for six years to rebuild the life of the local residents .
the detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority and survey results of the affected persons themselves .
the housing construction in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the scheduled spare parts ( German ) were completed in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to list the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , where 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma forms the closing light with 70 percent .
at the same time , six years after the disaster , the ev@@ acu@@ ated houses of Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ enter@@ arri@@ ste ( for the purpose of Re@@ duc@@ ting Kaz@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were to res@@ ett@@ le in final spare parts .
after the triple catastrophe , almost 80 000 people were forced to live in temporary housing .
in December 2016 , 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate lived in such homes .
almost 40 percent of those ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma in 2011 still live in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful . more than 75 percent of the ev@@ acu@@ ated who lived in homes after the disaster were res@@ ett@@ led in final homes .
for I@@ w@@ ate , the number here is 34 percent .
the state of work and everyday life in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures concerned
as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has been able to determine , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools that were affected by mis@@ fortune have re@@ opened their gates by December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later it is clear that industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is far more difficult .
while almost 100 per cent of the fishing har@@ bours in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation , only 30 per cent of the fishing ports have resum@@ ed their operations in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident have affected large @-@ scale suffering in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agricultural land .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i recovered 93 percent of its agricultural land , with only 66 percent of agricultural land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 per cent destroyed farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
it is unlikely that this is just a consequence of nuclear accident , as only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of land destroyed by Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma lie in the &quot; nuclear barrier zone . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures tourism has recovered largely , but also here Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma remains far removed .
the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are again 90 percent at the same level as before the disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can only show 75 percent .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal dw@@ ellers seem to be more difficult to earn their livel@@ ihood .
is the native population being prepared for the next major earthquake ?
in order to be able to determine an overall picture , the newspaper introduced numerous surveys among the local population and ev@@ ac@@ uation . she questioned her about the status of reconstruction and also how her feeling of feeling changed vis @-@ à @-@ vis the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in her introduction to the article K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the local population .
the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents have taken measures to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of respon@@ dents found that still not enough was done in terms of disaster prevention .
as it stands for those who had to be ev@@ acu@@ ated from the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture
in its edition of the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has also focused its attention on the situation of the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma ev@@ ac@@ uation .
Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had to witness not only the massive earthquake and the devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , but the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture was also a witness of the worst , disaster @-@ induced , nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed .
almost 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
at the beginning of 2016 , more than 23@@ ,000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , had been reloc@@ ated to permanent spare parts .
as of 2017 , there are still 40,000 residents living outside of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma outside of their home pre@@ f@@ ecture .
in the disaster areas most of the ev@@ acu@@ ates are older than 50 years old . they are well known because the efforts to rebuild Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma have to compete with massive construction projects . these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo in 2020 .
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when people meet people from other countries who speak a different language , the differences seem to be greater than the simil@@ arities .
after a while , however , one often recognizes that more than it seems at first sight .
these global connections are important as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look closely at these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep pod@@ cast we deal with issues that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment when they have felt very strongly connected to someone over language and country borders .
Ver@@ oni@@ ki Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the simil@@ arities between Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ ini explains how a migration has strengthened its affection for Iranian culture ; Adri@@ ana M@@ aci@@ as talks about the time when she worked with people from all over the world in London ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences that he has collected in a small village in Madagascar .

this week , a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was sent to the intensive care unit : last Friday , a police officer had hit him with a stroke against the head during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia . millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest march across the country .
Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva , who studies social sciences at the Federal University of Go@@ i@@ ás has suffered a skull @-@ brain trauma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors operated him on this Saturday and moved him into an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
the local photo@@ journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days .
on the pictures is also the face of the police officer , who attacked with a stroke . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police were known in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended until the conclusion of the investigation into the incident of active service .
the pictures show the police officer how he hits the face of the student Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a police officer beaten up a demonstr@@ ator and land on the intensive care unit , his face would be on television for six months and the entire repression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ kt@@ ali@@ z@@ ador , &quot; a media channel by media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , shared the video recorded by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z on the net in which you can see how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several param@@ ters are rus@@ hing to him shortly .
another video with the same scenes , but filmed from a different perspective , is also immersed in social networks .
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state , Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazilian Re@@ ais ( approximately 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and enable his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia while lying in the hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás :
Go@@ i@@ ás is witness@@ ing a wave of political violence : here , the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me Irish was murdered by his father because he attended the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . here , the military police of a W@@ hat@@ s@@ App group were assigned to de@@ crimin@@ alize the Occup@@ y movement , after being attacked by a police officer , who attacked him with a stroke .
police Hand@@ les
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil , in which there was brutal police operations against demonstr@@ ators last Friday .
police officers set up rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas at protests in the center of Rio de Janeiro , where prot@@ esters had set up a stage for speakers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Socialist and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to refra@@ in from violence against demonstr@@ ators via loudspeaker announcements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this also includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the country .
once again , the Brazilian media have shifted street protests by focusing on another unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window pane .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo deliberately reported a broken glass window to illustrate their front pages with a photo .
on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o fav@@ ored a cover story with a bus set in fire .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window pane than about the protests thousands of thousands of people serving the defense of a specific cause .
this must also be recognised if one is strictly against any form of property damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; here too the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gets absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate importance , and the typical acts of violence of the military police are obsc@@ ured by head@@ lines with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; demonstr@@ ators on the confrontation course with the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Un@@ indu@@ str@@ alization For@@ gotten Vill@@ ages in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , nearly hundreds of sugar cane factories all over Cuba closed the doors ( Photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the community of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cuban province of May@@ ab@@ que , is generally known as El Central - on Spanish sugar mill - despite the fact that there is no appreci@@ able sugar harvest on site .
it was two years ago when the activities were paraly@@ zed in the sugar cane factories .
after the fall , the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory lost after and after its facilities , until only the framework of steel and concrete remained .
approximately 27@@ 2 workers had to re@@ inv@@ ent themselves .
some changed the work .
others res@@ ig@@ ned daily to the factories that still gr@@ ind .
N@@ ene , a veter@@ an veter@@ an who rose every day at 4 : 00 o &apos;clock in the morning , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not depri@@ ve him of his sleep .
he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region , which are in operation after a long in@@ active period , because they have been preserved .
that was something he didn &apos;t expect .
N@@ ene rec@@ alls that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry already resist@@ ed pl@@ agues , the fall of socialism , low market prices , in@@ efficiency , bad management decisions and climate change .
in 2016 production was 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the quantity produced in 1910 .
the news would have been a motive for concern for the country several decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are no longer a news .
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off ?
the old platform of the church already saw better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity . the 155 sugar cane factories were technically out@@ dated and hardly competitive for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production objective was 4 million tons .
they left only the factories that could produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0,@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution to unemployment ?
the motives leading to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
nevertheless , the sugar price rose again about a decade ago .
from 2017 to 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the report published in 2016 by the OECD and FA@@ O , the Agriculture and Food Organization of the United Nations .
if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , raw sugar exports would generate around 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will certainly go into history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was the first words of Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from then on , the process of restructuring began in the sugar industry .
in the following years the de@@ commissioning of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people received their full salary for further training .
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on May 14 , 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez has worked in the factory since 1967 .
when N@@ ene , as known as a soldier , speaks about the closure of the factory , the word he repe@@ ats most is &quot; sc@@ am . &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents said : not one of them informed that the factory was shut down .
in order for the place to be preserved , they formed a full @-@ time working group .
before the first anniversary of the Jubilee , the first letters began to come .
these were officially written documents , which were distinguished only with regard to the parts that would be removed , the address and date .
all were signed by U@@ li@@ ses Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal .
from then on , the respon@@ s@@ ability was postpon@@ ed and the letters became more and more frequent .
Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was responsible for the abandoned factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane factories which were still in use , &quot; he ass@@ ures .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years old , wa@@ its for retirement in another facility , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was involved against his will at the shut@@ down of the factory in which he helped to build .
with every part he removed , he disman@@ tled one of his 31 working years .
the most developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important work bench was extingu@@ ished .
in many cases , there were no alternatives for the jobs and services generated by the facilities in the municipalities where they were located .
we will never know if during the mamm@@ oth speech of 21 October 2002 , the former president looked into the eyes of the persons present , when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would go well .
the price of the population for the closure of the sugar cane factories
since 2004 sugar cane is extracted only high by grinding .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
after two years the community of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory closed , or better said than they began to contam@@ inate it , they also stopped bit@@ ing the road , which also dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms .
without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look for other factories .
they became spare parts .
without a promising perspective , many young people left the region .
a food factory was created in the area , the production of which is not even used for the supply of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
at the end of 2016 N@@ ene came back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work .
nin@@ ety @-@ nine harv@@ ests bring to the old soldier a pension of two thousand peso a month to spend the years retired in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin colour , small , with a few teeth and clear voice , is not a suppor@@ tive person , yet he does not forgive the lies he told him .
they have been tor@@ turing him for ten years .
N@@ ene is in retirement for 65 years , not because it lacks force , but because he is bitter .

first Nations Children use Hip @-@ Hop to express themselves and preserve their own culture
&quot; &quot; &quot; recording of a song by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Home to Me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo used with approval by N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an .
young@@ sters of the First Nations communities across Canada are dealing with topics that are important to them . they do this using Hip @-@ Hop , thanks to a series of hiking workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an tour , workshop leaders have been bringing mobile recording studios to schools and youth centres for youth groups to teach song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were conducted by the educ@@ ator David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked in North Que@@ bec with ten Cre@@ e @-@ communities and then with the Cre@@ e Hip @-@ Hop Group The Nor@@ th@@ stars .
the workshop thus emphas@@ ises that the young participants encounter themes such as &quot; cultural identity , language , conflict , love , self acceptance , &quot; or whatever comes to mind .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the U.S. state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the territory of the tribal head of the Kit@@ um@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia tells of example the history of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a section in West Can@@ ada where nearly two dozen mostly indigenous young women were disappeared or murdered .
the cases were largely un@@ explained .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important it is to preserve traditional customs and customs despite the influences of global@@ isation .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people do not always master the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation have recorded , the refra@@ in is sung at Cre@@ e .
the young people involved got some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the Nor@@ th@@ stars hip @-@ hop band who gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e dialect .
on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an the verse is available , as well as a translation into English , which is translated into German :
sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me
but I try to continue my days on Earth
this is the day when you will hear our cry
because as a youth we have lost our way in life

in Japan , one can see plastic dishes almost every restaurant .
to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu , in the vicinity of the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( we introduce the &quot; Plasma Elec@@ tions of the Cour@@ ts &quot; ) from every dish that is served in this restaurant .
customers can see these plastic dishes and decide whether they will enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes .
in the Tokyo district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi there are a large number of these small companies producing plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented over 20 years ago in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a .
for most Japanese these plastic dishes are so common that they don &apos;t even notice them anymore . however , a new trend is turning them into show@@ y cell phone accessories and other gad@@ gets today .
at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the B@@ logger it@@ ini@@ i published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
now in special sale : new plastic rib@@ bons , decorated with plastic rib@@ bons , as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these artificial foods have been turned into kit@@ sch@@ y collective items , as in this case , fridge mag@@ nets :
here are a few Sho@@ ku@@ hin refriger@@ ators mag@@ nets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom in food production is becoming more and more complex .
in this case an ka@@ isen @-@ don ( a popular rice dish with seafood ) was transformed into a cell phone stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a cell phone stand .
we also made this part of the exhibition at the Tokyo station .
and here is an apple that holds your cell phone :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is a great design .
and that is only the beginning of an increasing flight into the com@@ ic .
some mobile phone stands and mobile phone designers allow you to produce your own artwork . in this case i@@ kur@@ a and laughter are used , a popular t@@ opping that is served with white rice .
some users had their doubts on Twitter :
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is someone who would say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now I can decorate my cell phone with laughter ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
this interest in plastic courts can also take on a less appeti@@ zing form , for example to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant .
our latest mobile phone stand has the form of mel@@ ted ice .
in addition , there are also rice balls ( O@@ ni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and hand@@ y@@ bands made of dried salmon .
for more bizarre plastic dishes , please refer to : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow us on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # .
if you would like to learn more about the origins of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , which is dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually produced .
a Mexican project tells the stories of the survivors of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of the fight against drug dealers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in reports of domestic and foreign media about the not@@ orious &quot; Fi@@ ght Against Drug Tra@@ ffi@@ cking &quot; in Mexico , the mis@@ si@@ sts and killed regularly appear only in statistics , but these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle ent@@ ails .
reporting on drugs bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the leader of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background .
the day after a violent incident nobody looks at the mour@@ ners or the churches who have learned to live with the pain .
there are behind every body , behind every bone find in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of inn@@ um@@ erable parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never heal .
that is why the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico has launched the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; living with the drug traffi@@ cking &quot; ) , telling these victims a voice and telling stories of people who were in the fight between the law enforcement agencies and cart@@ els .
animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project like this :
organized crime not only makes us afraid of our lives .
the effects are much more profound .
for example , when shops close because they are threatened by drug dealers and entire communities therefore have to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk .
the pain of the victims
a video titled &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; how fear changes &quot; ) tells exactly these stories .
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father looking for secret tom@@ bs every weekend to his son .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews , on only one day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; priests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as every Sunday we prepare for the task that we have set ourselves to go and search for tom@@ bs , according to the people we have loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electrical business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on October 13 he left the house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on October 15th , he should be back , but he never returned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need training . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is also my mother , who is here with me too .
at the moment she has no income .
you are the insurance of my father , but she doesn &apos;t pay them out because they require a death certificate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; where shall we get them ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of A@@ pr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co explain why the project is so important :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must not only show the faces of those who fear . we have to show the international community the conflicts , frag@@ ility , and leadership . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader of Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this article from Tax@@ co , in the State of Gu@@ err@@ ero in Central Mexico .
your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal , no matter what form it occurs :
I have known disease and sensation@@ alism for several years now .
I pass every day at the newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the front pages with pictures , which can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from files of specialists .
it brings me out of the frame .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be indiffer@@ ent or consider this as normal .
she continues writing :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old cous@@ in thinks he wants to become a Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealer ) when he is big . and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic deeds &quot; of offen@@ ders when they go through the streets .
for me it &apos;s as if they are scor@@ ing those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something has happened to them .
I see our weakness if stories become mere numbers in a statisti@@ c .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the in@@ fu@@ tility of the people is incredible to me when the death of six people and the en@@ forced dis@@ appearance of 43 students in a neighbouring village are justified by the fact that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so@@ aked &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think they try to convince themselves that they remain unaffected by such trage@@ dies if they do not stir and remain silent .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution &quot; Four months of black@@ mail in the Capital District : how a family was pl@@ under@@ ed with threats . &quot; it describes how armed criminals squee@@ zed money from their business for month until they destroyed not only the business , but also torn down their family .
you think of everything you &apos;ve lost and how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain never passes away , the trauma remains , the fear comes up again when you are alone .
habits have changed , telephone numbers too .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the far@@ ther we are from each other , the better .
she concluded with the words :
we want the others to be arrested because you don &apos;t know when they will kidn@@ ap or kill you .
I asked myself in these terrible days whether weeping would dissolve my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I have to learn to live with the pain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The For@@ gotten Children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a Generation of Viol@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime ?
what is it like to grow in a settlement on the edge of Mexico &apos;s most dangerous city ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care for them .
Br@@ yan is a orph@@ an and he tells that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , make potatoes , tor@@ till@@ as warm and make &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for preparing the bottles with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every year of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for whom the whole life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood was past two years before , when he was only a few blocks away from his home , seeing the bloody cor@@ p@@ se of his father who had been shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 , when violence was mixed by organized crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders according to the Civil Council for Public Security and the Government of the United States Government .
in 2010 alone the prosec@@ utor numbered 3@@ 103 mur@@ ders . this equ@@ ates to 8.5 mur@@ ders per day .
these are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and inv@@ ade the soul of the country .
only a few stories continue to live in the face of new head@@ lines . but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico has launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose aim is to portra@@ y the complex information behind the failed fight against drug traffi@@ cking , which has tor@@ mented the country over the last four decades .
if a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ UNG : this article and the pages to which it links , contain images on which violence is depicted .
the factor check is important at a moment when it comes to picking up a rum@@ or or expos@@ ing a fal@@ si@@ fication .
but how is the year after something has appeared for the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to continue to exist .
let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
since its first publication , it has been mis@@ leading to portra@@ y trage@@ dies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false coupling of image and event - &quot; wrong description &quot; or &quot; wrong context &quot; in terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is plenty of careful coverage of events in DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions about our desire for pictures to messages .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 , a tan@@ ker crossed the town of S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , til@@ ted around and explo@@ ded . 230 people died .
after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country had been neglected for years and devast@@ ated . roads in the region became dangerous paths full of po@@ thol@@ es that were difficult to drive .
tra@@ gically , it fell victim to the tank truck .
government officials described a fire@@ ball , which envel@@ op@@ ed dozens of houses including a movie theater near which was full of people watching the World Cup Championship .
houses scattered and cab@@ led cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned for lack of knowledge .
a picture with the title &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur user My@@ sti@@ cal Mon@@ key , January 12 , 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al pictures of the incident are depicting the horri@@ ble scenes of this day .
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of char@@ red bodies that are str@@ ung on the ground while people look at them .
but here the story does not end .
over the years the same photo was taken up several times on social media , blo@@ gs and other platforms and wrong@@ ly attributed to real trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , milit@@ ants from the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
e@@ ye@@ witnesses dras@@ tically reported atro@@ cities before they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody left to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many were dis@@ member@@ ed , shot or burned .
only on the basis of satellite images the follow @-@ up time could be visu@@ alized .
the occasion for the attack was also unclear , but the army base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt of B@@ oko Har@@ am to win country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture from the DR Kongo turned over again when it was fal@@ sely presented as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack :
this is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this mis@@ use of the image from the DR Kongo is only one in a number of abor@@ tions ; Africa Check has documented assignments on Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases the image was presented as a test@@ ament to mass kill@@ ings .
one step further , personal comments such as this example fal@@ sely relate to the image from the DR Kongo with sources of mass media in order to provide arguments .
the image from S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a report published by the United Nations , those who could flee were beaten , rape and several dead , some by burning .
while others reported about the violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts like the following came up , who brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news page , which fal@@ sely claimed that Myanmar &apos;s Th@@ an Being , monks and politicians had taken part in the assass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from the DR Congo to paint this information .
the original contribution , which was last accessed on April 26 , 2017 , can be accessed here .
other news organizations , who called AF@@ P as their source , also wrong@@ ly attributed to Th@@ ein being that statement , but did not have the picture taken from the DR Congo .
the global reach of false data
traces of these false cros@@ stal@@ ks reach back to the years 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; using an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reverse image search &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can see how far information can cross borders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an inver@@ ted image search with the search engine Tin@@ eye has found 3@@ 44 pictures under 18.@@ 8 billion images ( as of 3 May 2017 ) , which are very similar to the said picture from DR Congo .
they come from a mixed mas@@ h of private sites , social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have re@@ directed false reports , some have tried to expose fal@@ si@@ fications .
we have del@@ ine@@ ated examples of ab@@ u@@ sive usage and linked them to the respective countries , on the basis of which they were published . thus , we want to represent the reach more clearly than by language alone .
several examples of abuse can be used from the countries listed below ( which in some cases have been linked to each other ) .
here are some cases that can be r@@ ins@@ ed up now ( on the map in orange ) :
card : News frames .
country examples of false coupl@@ ers of the image from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange countries point to pages or servers that are still available through the examples of fal@@ si@@ fications or fal@@ si@@ fications .
the Coun@@ tries in Gra@@ y are examples which , according to the metadata and information available via Tin@@ eye , are probably also examples of fal@@ si@@ fication examples .
as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeri@@ ans and interested Arabs ) as part of a Th@@ reads to the &quot; War of the Budd@@ hi@@ sts Against Muslims . &quot;

Canada , 2015 .
in this article , a blo@@ gger from Que@@ bec City also disc@@ usses the mis@@ information , but also disc@@ usses the mis@@ use of the image from the DR Congo in connection with Nigeria and further questions about the intentions of the persons and the trage@@ dies involved in it ( in DR Congo and beyond ) .

Iran , 2012 .
a college of students of the@@ ology ( mul@@ l@@ ahs ) in Islamic countries published an open letter to support Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims across the news agency N@@ asi@@ m and used to illustrate the image of the DR Congo .

a resident of the district of P@@ ie@@ di@@ ca@@ stell@@ o from Tren@@ to posted this news on his side to express his solidarity with the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre in 2015 .
Nigeria , 2012 .
even within Nigeria the photo from the DR Congo became a proof of the bombar@@ d@@ ments of the B@@ oko Har@@ am in K@@ ano in public discussion forums .
Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme example of mis@@ use of the image from the DR Kongo on the one hand , expressing sympathy with the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre and on the other hand an attempt by a blo@@ gger , the claims that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are persecuted , too delicate , since the photos were used impro@@ per@@ ly .
Myanmar , 2017 .
the Myanmar government published a brief@@ ing on what it meant as &quot; deliberately disgu@@ ised news and photos that came to international media , international human rights organisations and governments in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings in terms of Myanmar . &quot;
this judgment , which has been published exclusively in English , also refers to counter@@ f@@ eit images of od@@ ors that are used by H@@ ate Spe@@ ech and used by extrem@@ ist groups to demonstrate that Muslims exter@@ min@@ ate Budd@@ hi@@ sts and vice versa ( which is often spread by Burma nation@@ alists ) .

this post pointing to the members of the Russian Orthodox community clearly states that the image of the DR Congo does NOT show Muslims who kill Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page wrong@@ ly claimed that the President of Myanmar demonstrated his 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought together the story with the image from S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and , at the time of publication , the picture is still contained in it .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article of 2014 about students , who had been killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the recently deleted , the Catholic close to the news page , An@@ á@@ li@@ sis Digital , has expressly declared that the image does not come from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that there is a &quot; similar d@@ schi@@ coup attack . &quot;
when the picture was subsequently circul@@ ated in connection with the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre of 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there were connections to Nigeria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Turkey , 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ Dün@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Nigeria burns , the world is sleeping ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the image of the DR Congo , provided with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , triggered a discussion among Muslims after the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted their communities to pay greater attention to these events , presum@@ ed in the name of Islam .
United States , 2015 .
the image was weather@@ ed as evidence of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times ) . but the messages associated with it were not taken up in any religious context .
instead , the aim was to pay attention to the relative number of deaths and comparing media coverage in comparison with Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( German ) , 2014 .
after a message that was allegedly written by a &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; on the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussion forums like this on Vietnam@@ ese and declared it to be un@@ registered .
from the embassy in which the image from the DR Congo was included , the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ in@@ mission@@ aries and Fr . Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos dist@@ anced themselves .
there are further confirmed examples of incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and pages in the following countries ( on the Gra@@ y folder ) also exhibit inks , but are no longer fully trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the craw@@ ler and occasionally have image file names associated with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all of these cases , which appeared clearly after the original item of 2010 , the picture may eventually have a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and images
there are two strong themes or frames that let these posts go through . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photograph was used in relation to greater discussion of the silence in connection with the kill@@ ings of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the kill@@ ings of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fr@@ aming uses the picture to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued compared to a European or French life .
understanding religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth examining how images are used in connection with these efforts .
a deeper question , however , is what happens when readers no longer believe these images .
with social media , there are tens of people who in@@ ad@@ vert@@ ently share the water around a tragedy .
does this sen@@ timent of false and fal@@ seh@@ ood suggest that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and dimin@@ ish the actual horror of what has actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the spread of violent images has already been extensively deb@@ ated ( for example ) .
one argument is that the retention of images of a refusal is equivalent to acknowled@@ ging the tragedy . sometimes , these images are even required by the victims themselves .
at the same time , the concern is that forci@@ ble images are des@@ ensi@@ ti@@ zing readers and viewers and the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which investigated how violent media act on helping others ) .
while there is a lot to discuss in the news media with regard to violence , the fact is that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting .
technologi@@ sts are experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; fake news . &quot; they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something that can actually be used either from context or completely ab@@ u@@ sive way .
however , any investigation of incorrect supplements should also take into account how international they can be .

such words exist in every language : they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific .
some of these irre@@ plac@@ eable words are already well @-@ known today ( like the famous Portuguese Sau@@ da@@ de ) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture ( such as the Spanish Sob@@ ota ) .
but everyone stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly resist any attempt of a simple translation .
a word or expression is not enough , which is why a full explanation and sometimes a context are needed to understand exactly what is meant by this one word .
these unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list .
most of these lists deal with Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages .
in the blog you can find , for example , words from the VAT @-@ cla@@ p language of Van@@ u@@ at@@ u , such as :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - get your parents in recognition of the way around you in your younger years .
and words in the Hun@@ sr@@ l language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The comfort or la@@ z@@ iness that you feel after getting war@@ med in the sun during cold days .
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog about :
they un@@ veil other cultures , reveal other thoughts and awaken our curiosity .
sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this site want to publish more of these &quot; irre@@ plac@@ eable &quot; words and show how different , valuable , and impres@@ sively these little languages are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; speakers of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Treas@@ ure Languages &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which are highly appreciated by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able are invited to upload their favorite locations here . &quot; &quot; &quot;

how Sri Lanka ren@@ ders with the worst floo@@ ding catastrophe of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood and land@@ slide catastrophe in this decade .
triggered by the mon@@ soon , which usually ends at the end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , N@@ il@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ alu O@@ ya have stepped over the banks in 15 districts in the south and west of the country .
following an opinion from the Sri L@@ ank@@ an cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ al centre from May 28 , 2017 , 126 people were killed and almost 100 people are missed due to the floods and slu@@ dge win@@ ches .
over 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and around 100 000 people were brought to 304 safe places of residence .
the rainf@@ alls continued on Saturday ( 27 May ) and the water levels in some areas were slowly returning .
health and hygiene conditions of the population are a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following images and videos convey an impression of the scale of the flood disaster :
floo@@ d@@ water in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water stands of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et deliver regular updates to the high water situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the scale of the disaster .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floods are wor@@ sen@@ ing the Den@@ gue crisis , Save the Children , after further rainf@@ alls are already on their way .
this morning , the N@@ elu@@ va bus stood in the high water , water level up to 6 meters . village of Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle also floo@@ ded due to the water p@@ eg@@ ger of Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da El@@ a .
the Air Force has provided five planes for rescue operations and further five are being dispat@@ ched for the transportation of emergency supplies to the inhabitants locked in their floo@@ ded villages .
various organizations and startups have also agreed to help .
Facebook pages like Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information about flood situations and humanitarian aid .
if any search and rescue teams need dr@@ ones for their operations , please call 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 .
for those who want to don@@ ate dry food and essential goods for flood victims -
we are now in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ hal@@ ana .
please call today the number 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 8@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if animals in this area need help .
the taxi call app Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks concerned people to share their location data with the help of the app , so that the data centre is informed .
last year after the disaster of the tropical storm Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ ens introduced a &quot; flood relief &quot; button that allowed users to call a vehicle to pick up assistance and donations . these were then sent for free to the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Red Cross .
they also introduced a &quot; S@@ OS &quot; key , which resulted in more than a thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for people included in flood and land@@ slide .
the combined efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , bring people in need for security and provide assistance .
this has prevented the loss of other human lives , and Sri Lanka &apos;s population now has the long way to restore norm@@ ality .
Muslims that cannot be seen
the Women &apos;s March on January 21 , 2017 in San Francisco .
photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and a dear friend .
I confi@@ de in her four years old daughter ; she tru@@ sts in me her children ; she is my rock in the surf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in one minute we call for slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the next one , we get the rights for trans@@ gender . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are in a sea of umbrellas and people , some hold the icon@@ ographic image of a woman with sc@@ arf up , bound from an American flag , others can@@ on@@ ade slo@@ gans against anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; These things do not concern you , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslim ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already taken this conversation .
people with whom I work or people who have known me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar who know them - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims &quot; that has built up in their conception .
they have had to kidn@@ ap me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not all look alike .
we practice our religion differently .
we identify ourselves with being Muslim in different ways . but somehow we all are put in the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims , who do not fit into it , are being de@@ mi@@ zed .
need to be de@@ bu@@ z@@ zed
I &apos;m not alone .
this even happened to the poet whose poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i .
which images come to mind when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
when Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Quran and Prophet Muhammad were the center of his poetry until the day he died .
but in the western show , the religion of Rum@@ is was er@@ ased , just like the most popular translations of its poetry .
this del@@ eting constitutes a large part of the history of the 1,7 billion Muslims in this world .
another exists in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims who have been col@@ oni@@ alizing Western books for centuries .
this temp@@ ting language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the ground @-@ breaking Palestinian scientist Edward S@@ aid tore the story behind these images in the 1970s .
but these pictures still prot@@ ru@@ de today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to ste@@ er them .
I worked for thir@@ teen years in the news industry and I saw how these powerful , flaw@@ ed narr@@ atives dominate our news@@ feeds .
this narrative over@@ shadows the reality that has led nine Muslim women to their countries over the past three decades , while the United States could not even choose their first female presidential candidate in 2016 .
this Nar@@ r@@ ative fails to recognize that when French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head@@ sc@@ arf in public buildings , and Saudi Arabian , Muslim women by their government are forced to cover their entire body , which are both sides of the same coin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group exercises its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this strong narrative weak@@ ens Muslim women who lead movements for change .
it is clear that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans who had been brought here with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of Qu@@ eer Muslims .
this narrative has cast down our collective imagination so deeply and flaw@@ ed that Si@@ kh men and children often become the goal of anti @-@ Muslim attacks and har@@ ass@@ ment .
because of these stories , which we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not only fear of Islam , religion , but fear of the &quot; other . &quot;
to the 1,7 billion belong
in the news industry , we are more than just telling stories that are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create narr@@ atives that help us to understand the world .
and my industry failed to capture the narrative of 1.7 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed to see where seven million Muslims make up the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious group in America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a third of the entire Muslim population is African @-@ speaking Americans .
six out of ten American Muslims are among the first @-@ generation immigrants coming from 77 countries .

four decades ago , my immig@@ rated parents came to New York to live their American dream .
my mother laid her first jewellery design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in New York sky@@ scra@@ pers ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ ker from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
back then , when Khan was re@@ inv@@ enting the world &apos;s sky@@ lines , my parents were absent Muslims and Americans .
but am I now a Muslim and American ?
sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of extrac@@ ting my Muslim recipes or my handy hand@@ ker@@ chief , which all Muslims carry with them - &quot; out of respect for Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
I jo@@ king , we don &apos;t carry all the hand@@ ker@@ chiefs with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t have to be the@@ ological experts to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or to be selected for additional safety checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists trying to fight widespread lies about Islam .
these lies are produced by the running volume of a well @-@ forged Islam@@ opho@@ bia machine with don@@ ors , think tanks and experts for false information which have manipul@@ ated our already er@@ ron@@ eous picture of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is .
due to the stories we tell and because of the way in which we tell them , anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility lies in more than just a foreig@@ ner who tears the veil of a woman .
or as the frigh@@ tening card of attacks on mos@@ ques across the USA , see below .

Islam@@ opho@@ bia in its ug@@ ly forms attacks our affili@@ ation .
it attacks our identity , which is so far @-@ reaching , so versatile and complex that it is impossible to fit into a drawer .

I would like to explain this .
I was born as a Muslim but a Muslim was only born into my imagination when I was four years old , in a provisional Mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ tery Church in New York .
when social scientists describe religious life , they refer back to the following terms : belief , behaviour and belonging .
my Muslim faith and behaviour may not always be visible , but they are there .
perhaps my girlfriend , my neighbor , my rock in the surf , would see that I am Muslims when they could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the evening ritual with my daughter if I kept her in my arms and whis@@ per the Arabic verses to protect the Qur &apos;@@ an and called Q@@ ul@@ s .
each of them I repeat three times .
I ask that they are protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see .
my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim nationality is always part of my shadow .

belonging to my grand@@ mother &apos;s mat@@ ernal side with her sisters ; how she gained a competition of art of flower arran@@ ging in Kar@@ achi for decades .
it is the picture of her that I see at this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by her perf@@ ected and un@@ finished paintings of painted Su@@ fi saints ; and a Qur &apos;@@ an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen captains , which she can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze .
to be Muslim means to speak the prayers they told me when I have a bad day .
to be Muslims is how they taught me to refer to God : Allah Me , what God means , my only Lord .
for a people who - for centuries - was colon@@ ized by an &quot; empire , &quot; which a company founded with the name of hon@@ orable Bri@@ tische Ost@@ ini@@ dien @-@ Company , it has a profound meaning to name God , my only Lord .
the author in 1987 with her grandfather .
application approved .
belonging means growing up and hearing that men do not cry , but at the same time to see that my immig@@ rant grandfather cri@@ es .
in between , while he writes books on modern Islam and about the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir@@ s , N@@ ana J@@ aan wept for his family in K@@ ash@@ mir , family ruled by India , which he could not close in his arms in half a century .
belonging to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians , whose families , like my grandfather , were torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who shared the Muslim world as at stake .
to be Muslims means knowing that in the last two centuries Europeans have &quot; col@@ oni@@ alized &quot; all to four Muslim countries .
it means to know that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of the story was dropped from a century ago over a Muslim country .
it means to know that at the same time the grandfather of my grand@@ mother , an Indian , c@@ ash@@ mir@@ i subject of the British empire , was lab@@ eled as &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time because he led the first mos@@ que in England .
before there were planes , he travelled to more parts of the world than I have ever been and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice .

belonging to my Muslim tribe of 1.7 billion goes deep into our unforgettable family trees ; our un@@ acknowledged history .
it means remember@@ ing that fourteen years ago the most powerful military in the world , with troops scattered across every continent , apart from Antar@@ c@@ tica , went to Iraq to pursue weapons of mass destruction that did not exist .
it means knowing that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is are buried beneath the ruins of the war .
to be an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means knowing that when a tragedy hits the US and susp@@ ects a Muslim name , history is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in .
it means to know that four hundred years ago the first call of prayer , the Az@@ aan , was called by a liber@@ ated black slaves named Bil@@ al .
it means to know that two hundred years ago an African schol@@ ar called Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this country .
it means to call Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people crowded the airports to fight against Muslim B@@ an .
it is the hope that I feel when we get up for our dreams and when we say black life .
being an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a K@@ ash@@ mir@@ i , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Muslim , and a journalist signi@@ fies the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple lines , but fail to communicate them to others .
the narrative of the 1,7 billion has more possibilities than a magic cube , but is represented in reducing doubt &quot; we &quot; against &quot; it . &quot;
being a mother means caring for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged individuals are building structural anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility .
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in the Muslim regimes that began with President Bush and wi@@ dened under President Obama .
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it exists in the immigration officer who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it is in a country that exclu@@ des its borders with people from just the countries it bom@@ bed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no @-@ fly @-@ list &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is largely aimed at Arabs and Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the wars that we carry and the bombs we throw on Muslim countries .
because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today .
in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists from the Nor@@ th@@ western University showed a scientifically correct image and asked them to evaluate groups on a scale of 1 to 100 regarding evolution .
Muslims received the lowest score .
the conversation we have to lead
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are too deeply dar@@ ing to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enth@@ use &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have decades back to recognize the roots of our fears , and the flaw@@ ed and dangerous ima@@ gery that we ste@@ er in our news editorial .
at least there is a growing movement led by American Muslims in the media industry trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history .
the Pod@@ cast Sea Som@@ e@@ thing , S@@ ay Som@@ e@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the Pod@@ cast # Good@@ wood Muslim ; the viral video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Sap@@ el@@ o Square on black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Schu@@ ster Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to print more Muslim authors and Ms Mar@@ vel , the PA@@ K@@ IS@@ TA@@ N@@ IS@@ CH , Muslim , American Super@@ hero@@ ine - all this makes me hope .
screen@@ shots of media initiatives that want to show the complexity and inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of Muslim American lives .
col@@ lage of the author .
but I am app@@ reh@@ ensive because of this difficult global timing in which we are .
and this moment has consequences beyond the 1.7 billion .
there is one reason that conspiracy the@@ orists who existed in the dark corners of the internet now lead the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; different &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; other . &quot;
a few years earlier , they had not yet given them ; now they have ma@@ stered large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the realities and the history that I was not aware of when I was as old as now my daughter , but who made me a Muslim Muslim today .
things that I left in my speech like a bread@@ cr@@ umb line .
things that may spark memories , as in all the inter@@ sections that constitute our humanity , a story may l@@ ur@@ k where someone is made to a &quot; other . &quot;
right now , on the other side of the Berkeley bridge in Berkeley , con@@ vers@@ ations take place within the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
more than a hundred ac@@ adem@@ ics talk about our problems with the &quot; other , &quot; &quot; structural rac@@ ism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot;
but these are not concepts that we usually throw in our schools around us or which we read in our newspapers .

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
why do I tell this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars will be fought and people are re@@ comp@@ lied with by creating the &quot; other &quot; in the public imagination , four decades ago was a scientific assistant at Stan@@ ford .
we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of being conscious and un@@ aware of the &quot; other . &quot; as my girlfriend and I imagine in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the occupation we have no president , the chocolate cake , while he already bom@@ bed some broken countries and &quot; other made &quot; people goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion .
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for narrative art aims to preserve urban language diversity
story telling , by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ user Daniele Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be a way to contact someone here and now despite a language barrier ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling initiative ( T@@ LS ) , telling stories in their original language is a possible answer .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the un@@ sur@@ pass@@ able blog .
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written word but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and honor the multitude of languages of big cities .
in fact , urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin lie in Australia or O@@ ak@@ land in the United States where T@@ LS has already held events since 2015 , the risk that small and not so small languages are not passed on to the children born there .
the following applies to the feasibility of the project :
the mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that embrace diversity - safe spaces where residents do not have to forget who they are to belong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening to it often involves understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these events instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening to ass@@ essing , feeling , feeling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , stor@@ y@@ t@@ ellers put their story first in their own language and then translate or explain them in English .
even though the participants are not a professional story t@@ eller , their devotion and their representation make it possible for the audience to listen to it .
they evo@@ ke laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows , for example , a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language of D@@ af@@ ing . during this turn , the stor@@ y@@ t@@ eller R@@ assi@@ du@@ ou Kon@@ ate sei@@ zes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of stor@@ y@@ telling .
in another event , John Ny@@ amus@@ ara tells the f@@ able of the rab@@ bit and the Bab@@ oon in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
after explaining the meaning of his be@@ ak , John Ny@@ amus@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is it to speak to an audience that does not understand your language ? &quot; with a wide gr@@ in , he shares his sense of inclu@@ si@@ veness :
you have listened !
they were attentive ...
they were with me !
until now , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and the organizers hope to extend this . anyone who is inspired by the project can get in touch with T@@ LS to organize their own story t@@ eller shows .
Puerto Rico ur@@ ges the US to re @-@ establish public debt
with the aim of a re @-@ examination of Puerto Rico &apos;s public debt , which amounts to 72 million US dollars , various religious and civil organizations took part in a mass demonstration on 3 April 2017 ; the march started with the African Cap@@ it@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went to Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ an .
it was proclaimed by the group@@ ing &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da . &quot;
the advoc@@ ates of the re@@ constitution of debt have also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their requirement :
the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos are calling for politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies responsible for the debt to be held accoun@@ table for their corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for a financial audit and a management committee without personal interests in public debt , with fixed , working conditions corresponding remuneration that acts in favor of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are black@@ ma@@ iled and oppressed .
the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos are ref@@ using to pay a debt that is not thei@@ rs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not find themselves tied with falling pension payments .
we demand immediate action .
the island - not in the United States - is suffering from a severe financial crisis .
hence , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; an non @-@ profit non @-@ profit organization without a party affili@@ ation with a focus on soci@@ o@@ economic development , proposes a law on state responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state supervision .
these are their reasons :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Ri@@ cos demands extensive restructuring of the state infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
measures imposed on the outside will be je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed without the participation and conviction of citizens to be rejected by the people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the demonstration wore the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Night Vi@@ gi@@ l for Light and Truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here are some impressions :

the Syri@@ ac @-@ Palestinian web developer Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and supporters continue the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he made for an open network .
at this year &apos;s re : Publi@@ ca , the annual conference on digital culture , which is hosted in Berlin , an event dedicated to the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign .
Mé@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of the CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , managing director of Book Spr@@ ints , a publishing house produced by so @-@ called &apos; Book Spr@@ ints &apos; completed books within three to five days , read extracts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Coll@@ ective In@@ quiry ( The cost of freedom : a collective research ) .
the book published last year and is available here ro@@ yalty @-@ free contains a series of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression .
it is a tribute to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it reads :
this book seeks to discuss how movements are built for free knowledge and what the true costs are with which this is connected .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movement for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news@@ feeds and to create some sense of our various experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ m , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15 , 2012 .
his name was removed from the directory of the A@@ dra prison , in which he sat on 3 October 2015 .
since then , we have no information about its present state or place of residence .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book titled Coll@@ ective Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce gives his friends and his family a voice that is pushing for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom , instantly .
seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for its participation in a free culture has led many of us to think about their own dest@@ ini@@ es , deeds and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what did we choose for ?
what have we given up in this process of temporary extreme beliefs ?
the web developer for open source and digital assets has been in the detention of Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution , to an unknown place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Military Police Bass@@ el &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had taken part of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strictly secret &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; command of the military court from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by people on 12 November 2015 who accused himself of being an inside of the Assad government and notified them of an alleged death sentence against her husband .
however , his place of residence and condition remains unknown .
a pioneer of creative comm@@ ons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist , and currently managing director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Bas@@ sels &apos;s cultural prototypes was more pre@@ ten@@ tious than the work he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross@@ roads of numerous civili@@ zations , and here Greek @-@ Roman architectural styles merge with local traditions and Persian influences .
at that time , Bass@@ el was not able to know that ten years after he started working , the IS would do everything to em@@ body this architecture , which em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Syria but the world .
this expedition into digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule which will be inv@@ alu@@ able to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
tra@@ gically , Bass@@ el could not finish this project yet .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i also contributed to the book and writes about her husband &apos;s passion to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison :
I spent my entire life dre@@ aming of freedom and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el taught me English , even when he was already in jail .
I have learned to read , write and speak English well .
he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who has asked . he has taught others to read , write and speak English .
Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he taught me the internet .
he also taught other prisoners how to use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without actually holding one in their hands .
G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a commission that she wrote in 2012 and 2015 to her husband when he was in custody .
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together on the book for one year .
she s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ed the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated it from Arabic into English .
the book is available without licence .
book cover by Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
here is an excer@@ pt from the book of Nor@@ a titled &quot; It happens &quot; :
it happens at every visit ,
that I sink in the world of your beautiful eyes ,
that I lose my mind at the moment in which we embrace ,
that each of the dangers doesn &apos;t care for me ,
each of the f@@ ences , fet@@ ters and guar@@ dians
I forget the cr@@ ush of the prison
and I enter every detail of your voice and words
which I carry with passion with me ,
when your eyes say good@@ bye
and I will leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I quickly return to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to bring back all those moments ,
and to we@@ ep and smile at your absence .
I testify to myself that I will return soon ...

Bas@@ sels History is not unique in Syria .
since the start of the protests in 2011 against Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) .
those who were arrested or disappeared under the regime of violence were tor@@ tured or even executed .
until 2016 , according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ ne@@ sty International , at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians have died in jail since 2011 .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
today , we reiter@@ ate our demand in the hope that we have to do this for the last time .
Moz@@ ambique : back on previous post , due to corruption @-@ induced governor
Moz@@ ambique re@@ acted to a corruption case in which a member of the government returned to the workplace in the state machine after half of his prison sentence where corruption was committed .
it was Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other def@@ end@@ ants on account of an em@@ be@@ zz@@ lement of 54 million Me@@ tics ( around 800 000 Euro ) .
the money came from public funds of the airports of Moz@@ ambique , whose council managed Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 for good guidance and immediately called for its re @-@ adjustment to the company , which took place on April 19 .
in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic requ@@ esting the motion , there would be no reason for Cam@@ ba@@ za to return to its old position , since the company did not undergo disciplinary proceedings following its imprisonment .
however , many inhabitants don &apos;t like the action well .
the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ bli@@ ca , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution committed to public transparency , condemned the decision of the company to re @-@ establish the director in an interview with Deutsche Welle :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and clari@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a step backward in terms of the efforts of our legal system , such as C@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we are aware of is that the company should have initiated disciplinary proceedings against the offen@@ ding one .
however , the company apparently remained silent and did not take appropriate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Moz@@ ambi@@ can social media , also re@@ jects this behavior and considers the case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contradictory &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Cam@@ ba@@ za was a competent person , he would be counsel@@ or after he was sentenced to prison and half of which had been cut off .
he could keep paying lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish his image .
but since he is in@@ competent he cons@@ ented to be integrated into the company , which he helped to inflic@@ t damage .
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za will gladly pay for its silence .
un@@ disgu@@ sted !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Moz@@ ambique and student of political science in Brazil says that the director has no mor@@ als :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was rewarded by the state because he offen@@ ded him I cannot believe that someone was rewarded in such a way that the state has already so mas@@ sively insul@@ ted the state .
Cam@@ ba@@ za lacks the moral to return and serve the state , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead only served himself by the state .
Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself has become tired of this man who was pre@@ charged and eventually sentenced to a long prison term .
to be honest , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te pre@@ fers to remind the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , that a th@@ ief belongs to prison :
thi@@ eves are part of Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el &apos;s prison will not only be remembered by the Moz@@ ambi@@ ans as the first independent president , but also as a sharp , single @-@ ed@@ ged and - by the way - proph@@ etic speakers .
one of his most famous oral portra@@ y@@ als was when he strongly affir@@ med that &quot; an ambitious person is capable of anything , even the fa@@ ther@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest , to sell . &quot;
Sam@@ ora also said : &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious person changes , my experience shows that it is not so . he changes tactics , but he does not turn away from his ambi@@ tions .
an ambitious person is criminal at the same time . &quot;
in Twitter , the reactions were also negative :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison ; he sat for 10 years and was free .
and today the company , with which he rep@@ ut@@ ates money , uses him again under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ O@@ M@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - blu@@ ei@@ dos@@ ys@@ ses ( @ az@@ mal _ Ra@@ fik ) May 12 , 2017

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ors many users un@@ ju@@ stly
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as or spl@@ its b@@ asses .
photo by San@@ j@@ ay A@@ char@@ ya , Wikipedia Comm@@ ons , Creative Comm@@ ons Attri@@ bution @-@ Share A@@ like 3.0 Un@@ ported
according to information from Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their posts from the network because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although the origin of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin , or generally used as an ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot;
Facebook cens@@ ors the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; or as a part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network .
in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely depreci@@ atory conn@@ ot@@ ation .
in particular , it is a word commonly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims who represent a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; may be associated with rac@@ ism today , but the word itself does not automatically appeal to hate speech .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that even posts in which they have discussed the use of the word have been cens@@ ored in order to express their use .
in addition there are several Bur@@ m@@ ical words with basic mean@@ ings that have the same sequence of letters as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , it is written on Bur@@ mes@@ isch also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( spi@@ der b@@ se ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( Kam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ cra@@ cker A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post from one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends in a wit@@ ty way whether they knew how to allevi@@ ate his back pain by making a pu@@ n .
the proposition of ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ isch - resembles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different .
there were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
Z@@ in Win H@@ tet is of the opinion that she will reduce hate speech by radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook needs to be more analytical before del@@ eting all posts suspected of spreading rac@@ ism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook does not delete the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it filters the word automatically .
automati@@ sm will not understand what you write on fac@@ t@@ hook .
what it should do instead is to carefully analyze the mail and control it by checking the words next door .
for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e . &quot;
the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists , who spread hate speech , get a pretty good lesson .
now it is time to circumc@@ ise their nation@@ alism .
while the action may send a strong signal to everyone who dis@@ semin@@ ates hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long .
the experiences of social networks in China , such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat , have proven that the cens@@ orship of cat@@ ch@@ words is often a cat and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or an alternative sp@@ elling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook started del@@ eting his posts after he just wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was banned from the social network :
... when I became aware of this new directive from Facebook , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to read , post and share content for 24 hours because the post &quot; denied the Facebook community standards . &quot;
Facebook has removed a multip@@ licity of posts from people who have no negative intentions or simply try to show their opinions to the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed , which has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
in the post , the author expressed his opinion on why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more prior to the beginning of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community asking for advice :
Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma by its platform , but it does not work .
to cens@@ or such words will bring even more hatred within the different communities .
in addition , it seems as if they have started this without a local context or technical support and have banned words such as &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; pe@@ as curr@@ y . &quot;
even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the fal@@ sely deleted posts .
if they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a great deal of turnover , that would be great .
Facebook &apos;s automatic cens@@ orship has provided a lot of ridi@@ cu@@ le among users .
instead of taking it seriously , users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; in the context of hate speech , to see if their posts are taken off the grid .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts , which contained no hate speech but were removed :
used with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads : &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ as curr@@ y and watch an Indian movie .
just to try out if Facebook removes the mail containing the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the post says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , do you then heal people ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
over the past five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists who have used social networks to expand their voices and influence have increased .
among other things , hate speech in social networks is to additionally heat the violence in the communities in Myanmar , especially in the Rak@@ h@@ ine area , where there were thousands of confron@@ tations between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised for his failure to control the ev@@ asive hate speech on his Bur@@ m@@ ese sides .
but instead of simply cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have looked better on context than code @-@ focused initiatives and learned from them .
Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago concludes with the chil@@ dr@@ ens &apos; marriage
a wedding ring in the sand .
photo by Der@@ ek Gav@@ ey , CC B@@ Y 2.0 .
it is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament unanim@@ ously approved a law to prohi@@ bit this practice , so that the age @-@ bearing age is now at 18 .
before this change of the married couple , some members of Hin@@ du and Muslim religious communities held their practice , and in May 2016 , Brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ sad Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the Inter @-@ Religi@@ ous Organization ( I@@ RO ) , a group representing representatives of the various religious groups in the country , said that the state should not interfere since that , age does not occupy the maturity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is a contractual partner of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child , the min@@ ors as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; defined &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every man under the age of 18 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children who had already been married to 15 was 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and at 18 it was 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the Statisti@@ cal Central Office of the country confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 young girls were married from 1997 to 2007 .
online peti@@ tions and social media movements aimed at aboli@@ shing the laws of child@@ birth followed at the foot and rejo@@ iced with great support . undoubtedly , they helped to bring about this outcome .
nevertheless , everything went smoothly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Hin@@ du leader , for example , had no hes@@ itation in saying to the critics of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; child marriage &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; they should take care of their own affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of religious opposition spark@@ ed tensions in this really un@@ complicated matter , and at some point doubts arose whether the opposition would agree with the draft bill .
yet at the beginning of 2017 , the bill against child marriage was decided - in spite of 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent one who ab@@ stained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law .
now only the president of the country must agree and declare the law .
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators gave a status update on Facebook , which Les@@ lie @-@ An@@ n Bo@@ is@@ elle again posted on Inst@@ ag@@ ram :
Mr. Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against child marriage was voted in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives with 35 votes and no one against it .
having been decided beforehand in the Senate , the draft can now become a law .
the majority of social media users were thri@@ lled because the laws of child@@ birth have finally been changed .
Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who is a minist@@ erial office in the Ministry of Education , said :
it took too much time and unnecessary talk that concealed the heart of the matter , but do you know what ? the wo@@ e is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that is worth almost every price .
while Abel Jackson was of the opinion , it was definitely long enough to aboli@@ sh the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ al @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day had finally come :
public Status Update on Facebook from L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : News !
the law has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , Vo@@ ices - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
behind Mut@@ ota , affiliated with the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group , who openly spoke about the importance of the adoption of the law , noted :
the marriage age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
the amend@@ ment to the amend@@ ment to the married couple was adopted today , 9 June 2017 .
there are 41 de@@ pu@@ ties in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives and 35 of them were present at the vote .
all members agreed to vote have voted for the law .
the pedi@@ atri@@ cian is no longer permitted in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long fight ( ... )
many thanks to all the activists who fought for him .
congratulations .
a thanks to our MEPs .
but a possible hook comes in the form of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary General of the San@@ atan D@@ har@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hin@@ du organisation in the country .
a few months before Mahar@@ aj announced his intention to take legal action , the law was to be passed , and he seems to deliver his promise .
during the General At@@ tor@@ ney General , Paris Al ra@@ wi , an advoc@@ ate of the law , said it was quite legitimate if Mahar@@ aj wanted to go against the law , most social media users would like to address the debate on the subject differently .
Patri@@ cia Wor@@ rel@@ l proposed :
dear sat , instead of holding the discussion so general , in a way that can only evo@@ ke panic and dis@@ grace , instead of talking about the problem that we are ab@@ using the state in our bedrooms , &quot; would you be ready to continue the discussion ?
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
but whether it comes to a court action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - but there are still places in the world where children are legal or still the norm , even though there are laws that they prohi@@ bit .

by mirr@@ oring web pages Turkish users can view Wikipedia content again
the Wikipedia page was published on 18 January 2012 , contrary to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright legislation in the USA , internationally obsc@@ ured .
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
for more than a month , Turkey has been blocking the popular and crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based on en@@ cyclo@@ pedia Wikipedia .
day by day it becomes clearer how important the platform for users is to find and share helpful and reliable information .
both students and repor@@ ters and fans of TV series fight against the block@@ ade .
although many techni@@ c@@ ite Internet users are used to using b@@ yp@@ assing tools for blocked web pages ( a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN pre@@ val@@ ence in the world ) , most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey since 2008 locked Article from Wikipedia , as recently described in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ages of the Internet have been held since 2007 after the Internet Law ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted .
after China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia .
while the platform remains locked , there are now several mirrors ( pages that mirror the content of Wikipedia and are often updated ) .
one solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform put all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centralized pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network ( i.e. computer calcul@@ ator ) , which is not based on the system of domain names and therefore makes a complete cens@@ orship quite difficult .
the content is , in spite of legal prohibition , can be called upon .
in a blog post , IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
once we &apos;ve heard the news ( about the locking of Wikipedia ) , we put everything on taking snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , there is the possibility to read the content in distributed and distributed fashion .
this can help users to at least view all Wikipedia content even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org themselves .
IP@@ FS also stated that this step was done independently of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is merely screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock .
Cris@@ tian Con@@ son@@ ni from Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Italy has brought both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ cyclo@@ pedi@@ .org , a mirror site from Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mirrors when locked in the respective country Wikipedia .

it is not a complete copy of a proxy address , a mirror .
you access another URL that is not the original . that what you see is from Wikipedia .
in essence , the server direc@@ ts the request to the correct Wikipedia page so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia , even if they are locked in Turkey .

a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for nature conservation
a su@@ h@@ len@@ ght Rhin@@ o , Ch@@ it@@ wan .
photo by Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
used with permission .
Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him . they were blur@@ ry with badly positioned motifs and washed colours .
this motivated him to carry a camera with him and try to strai@@ gh@@ ten the situation .
back then he was a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar tries to bring Nepal wildlife to the international stage .
and his home location next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw attention to Nepal &apos;s wildlife .
he described on Facebook how this first @-@ class location helps him :
I live on the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! !
I just rested at home when I suddenly called in Navar@@ re ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida ) . he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rap@@ ti river a le@@ op@@ ard would be .
the dam is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father had watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the le@@ op@@ ard was and I immediately began to kne@@ el pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar stri@@ ves to cooperate with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for N@@ ept@@ une &apos;s nature and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as frigh@@ tening as they look .
and he ought to know &#91; it &#93; , for he had already face to face to tig@@ ers face to face ,
a tiger can &apos;t distur@@ b the mind of the sheep during sleep ! !
late at night . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
also I was on the way home because of the darkness , when suddenly the king of the bu@@ si@@ est appeared . he sets out immediately , we look at us and he star@@ es me through the S@@ al trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals Sag@@ ar places the logo &quot; I click for conservation &quot; ( ite . : I click for environmental protection ) on its photos .
however , his passion for the promotion of Nepal and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days , mostly living in a tent to shoot at the Bar@@ dia National Park recordings from Ot@@ tern . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodations .
see below some of these photos .

this post was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India .
a revised version has been re @-@ published as part of a content sharing agreement .
in many parts of India , women avoid addressing the names of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
instead they use a pron@@ o@@ uns or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h , women admit that they respect the husband because of social pressure , as well as fear of the consequences they should dis@@ regard the norm .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was condemned from the Indian state of O@@ dish@@ a by a pseu@@ do court and rejected by her family and the village community after she had addressed a married family with her name .
the tradition of nam@@ ing their wives also is common among men . however , they have far fewer rights to fear if at all they should not follow this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the P@@ une district , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health staff and house@@ wives , joined a unique club and became the main topic of the city &apos;s main topic .
it is a place only for them alone , where they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
as one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states , he is part of the # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al campaign run by the Community Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and campaig@@ ning for the exploitation of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
for seven years Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was has been working with the help of their video camera to discover practices such as children &apos;s marriage , HIV and AIDS patients , and leads these clubs .
she tells us how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambass@@ adors for change .
the first video , which Roh@@ ini showed in her discussion , was about women who don &apos;t call their hus@@ bands by name .
she chose this topic because she wanted to open the conversation about the patri@@ archy with a problem with which women can easily identify .
not to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands lou@@ dly , is a custom that they all uph@@ old and never questioned .
raw ini means :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not consider this is regarded as dec@@ eit@@ ful , as a woman without morality .
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this discussion .
at the beginning Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband , wanted to try out at home as it runs .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini re@@ counts :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video ended .
Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said I should call him by his name from now on .
with this confidence in the luggage , Roh@@ ini started their first discussion club .
many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ archy &quot; before . some believed it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise .
Roh@@ ini asked each participant to tell her husband &apos;s name with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then she asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us what they want , does it mean they don &apos;t respect us ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; should it not be equivalent ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their hus@@ bands over their lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra about breaking a centuries @-@ old tradition in which married women can never speak the name of their hus@@ bands .
Roh@@ ini re@@ counts :
a woman was so intim@@ id@@ ated that during the whole exercise she was ch@@ asing herself ; another decided to release the whole pent @-@ up fru@@ stration towards him and his family by escap@@ ing him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I &apos;ll never forget it again .
even in the rush of adren@@ aline about having broken with an ancient tradition , the women decided that they would actually try to call their hus@@ bands by name .
and they kept their word .
in the next few days Roh@@ ini received a large number of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put the women up@@ side down : his wife could not stop saying his name .
another club member decided to do it at dinner in front of the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her , she got sc@@ ared and said that it was a mistake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rou@@ tes thought I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation was in force .
Roh@@ ini reports how women tried to stop other practices such as wearing the carcin@@ no@@ ber@@ red dot on the forehead that shows the sp@@ ital status :
why do women only need to show that they are married ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said to my husband that I would bear the zin@@ er@@ red dot if he did . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he only laugh@@ ed and I stopped carrying him .
the other women have not completely stopped doing so , but think they are in a better position to choose themselves , not to wear it on some days .
for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange opinions and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make an excursion with each discussion club . &quot; &quot; &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry about who could hear what , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last few months they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes for the first time in their lives ; they d@@ anced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before .
raw ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never spoken so hon@@ estly about some things , for example , how our identi@@ ties are tied to our hus@@ bands .
it feels great to be able to say certain things , no matter how small they are .
in a discussion , we talked about the concept of honour and how it is connected to clothing .
some women in the group have been wearing sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most it &apos;s okay , but some wanted to wear a sal@@ ine kur@@ t , a wide shirt over a trousers ; they didn &apos;t dare .
after many arguments and discussions about the advantages of their own dress code , mor@@ als linked to the sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ed their own pair of Kur@@ tas ( upper shirts ) into a discussion round , so that women could wear them .
next they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a where they can wear je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini are sure they &apos;ll manage it .
on the question of whether something has changed in the five months since their first discussion club , Roh@@ ini confirmed that things are slowly rolling out :
we have only made small steps so far .
some women tried it a few times , but then stopped to say the name of her husband .
some , including me , still do it , but only if they are alone and not with other family members .
only one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear vermi@@ lion on their foreh@@ e@@ ads .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the viol@@ a for more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothes - lie at the end of a difficult @-@ to @-@ navigate river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they become aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
as explained in Roh@@ ini :
each of us is a victim of the patri@@ archy .
I am also .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing .
we all sit in the same boat .

the first Japan visit to the popular band The Beat@@ les is celebrated with a commemor@@ ative day
the Beat@@ les at their landing in Japan .
screen@@ shot from the official YouTube channel of the Beat@@ les .
on June 29th of this year , the h@@ ash@@ tag was to be found in the Japanese Twitter trend , where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les .
the visit of the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is regarded as a turning point in the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war period .
the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ i@@ ko , who was exclusively inter@@ viewed by the Beat@@ les in London in 1964 , noticed in 2016 on the occasion of the 50@@ th anniversary of his first visit :
for just under five days the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese go through .
people here have quite quickly realized that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many known Japanese sizes had reached its zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the music of the cult band is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , president of the retail@@ er Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review online magazine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
good morning ! for today , the Beat@@ les Memorial Day is in Japan . for the first 51 years ago , they were here in Tokyo .
even today , songs from the Beat@@ les are sung in Japanese kar@@ aoke bars and in English classes at Japanese center schools .
the Beat@@ les kit@@ sch survived all this .
today is Beat@@ les commem@@ oration day .
we all love The Beat@@ les in our house .
I don &apos;t know if this &quot; W@@ inn@@ ie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; doll is supposed to be John L@@ enn@@ on or not .
and as it is for fans , Japanese make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the familiar places that are connected with the band .
if you love the Beat@@ les , these are your 5 places that you absolutely must visit .
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Math@@ ew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fields ( New York Memorial )
4 ) P@@ enny Lan@@ e
5 ) ( From the link ) The Beat@@ les Story ( museum ) , Liverpool
pilgri@@ ma@@ ges can sometimes not be bizarre :
good morning together .
today is Beat@@ les commem@@ oration day .
right now in 1966 , the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time .
the characters from the movie K @-@ On ! went on a pilgrimage to London and walked over Abbey Road .
the same we did last year .
and of course some companies make use of the fan community in terms of market terms , such as this R@@ amen shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo .
good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen !
and what could that be for a day ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; today I will listen to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ ester@@ day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and eat r@@ amen no@@ od@@ les at Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is how the day is going to be .
so , we hope you &apos;re there !

bald men are ab@@ duc@@ ted and killed in Moz@@ ambique
the Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia police warned the population that bald men could be aiming for attacks in Moz@@ ambique .
photo : An@@ ders Bol@@ in / Fli@@ ck@@ r , CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0
a new system of kidn@@ apping of bald persons for organ traffi@@ cking , probably for super@@ sti@@ tious purposes , concerns the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , a province in Moz@@ ambique . the local government now called a number of operations to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometers from the shore of Malawi .
one of the victims was de@@ capit@@ ated and part of the organs had been taken .
two men were arrested and subsequently led to the use of the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi .
there is the local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a bald man could contain gold or bring wealth , the Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia police spokes@@ man explained .
it is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Moz@@ ambique .
another group , the goal of murder for obsc@@ ure purposes , is people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the fact that the UN 2016 carried out a mission in the South African country to investigate this practice .
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of Southern Africa , especially in neighbouring Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to fight this super@@ sti@@ tion and prejudi@@ ce .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who intend to travel to the country :
attention to bald men travelling to Moz@@ ambique are target ritual attacks , warned the Moz@@ ambi@@ an police according to the latest kill@@ ings of three bald men due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange where the kill@@ ings took place .
Hus@@ son Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and inhabit@@ ant of the city of In@@ ham@@ ban@@ e in the south of Moz@@ ambique , said that the local police already follows the case :
PR@@ M thinks that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of bald men .
the persecution and murder of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ ą@@ bal@@ a , Province of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , has cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans , which also indicates that a faith exists , according to which the victims in the head might have power to generate the riches .
in recent days , three men with hair loss problems have been murdered in this part of the country .
Angela F@@ errei@@ ra Sam@@ anth@@ a shared on Facebook the chron@@ ic@@ le of B@@ log@@ gers &apos; poor Sn@@ ai@@ ppa , who suggested that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Moz@@ ambique :
I M@@ Ö@@ CH@@ TE GER@@ NE E@@ IN Moz@@ ambique , TH@@ AT S@@ ICH are ashamed of a country where the people would be ashamed to seek sex against good marks , work and other achievements , a nation in which people would not hurt or even take their lives to earn their bread , a land in which neither the Al@@ bin@@ os nor bald or bald persons are hun@@ ted for super@@ sti@@ tious purposes or &quot; black magic . &quot;
despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some of the opportunity for mac@@ ab@@ re hum@@ our could not be missed .
Zen@@ aida GI@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Moz@@ ambique and enthusiastic Twitter farmers , twe@@ et@@ ete that both the chief of the Mur@@ rum@@ bal@@ a district , Pedro S@@ ange and the Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zi@@ as police spokes@@ man , In@@ á@@ cio D@@ ina , are both plain @-@ headed :
Moz@@ ambique &apos;s authorities are very concerned about the murder of bald persons .

free Bass@@ el : N@@ eti@@ zen Under Seri@@ ous Th@@ re@@ at , December 2012 ( in English ) New international community reactions to the medical treatment of Nobel prize lau@@ re@@ ates and dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o
a photo by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , probably just recently made .
this story was originally published on 8 July 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement with Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he was hospit@@ alized due to liver cancer at the end stage .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years &quot; imprisonment for &quot; Subversion , &quot; after he participated in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o calling for democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China described Li@@ us case as &quot; an internal affair &quot; and told a spokes@@ man that he considered it &quot; not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot;
nevertheless , China continues to receive calls from the international community , the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , or to permit treatment abroad .
while some countries have critic@@ ised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others have completely wi@@ ped out the issue .
Hong Kong Free Press has summar@@ ised some of the reactions abroad .
United Nations Accor@@ ding to United Nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment on whether the United Nations should ex@@ ert pressure to allow Li@@ u to be treated abroad .
Norway from Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende refused to answer questions about Li@@ u &apos;s release .
the relationship between China and Norway was st@@ alled after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u in 2010 , although the Norwegian government announced that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations were only resum@@ ed in December last year . only in June , Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon exports to China , because exports have been largely blocked since 2010 .
after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed hope for unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo .
due to his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his prize .
during the ceremony , Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union - European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to immediately release Li@@ u and his wife from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants .
the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called on China to release Li@@ us , as announced in a statement on 30 June :
at the same time , we expect China to aboli@@ sh all restrictions of Mr. Li@@ us wife and family members .
they should meet and receive all the visits they desire and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
United States of America
us ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad told us that the Americans &quot; wish him that he has the possibility of treatment abroad , in so far as it can help him in his recovery . &quot;
a spokes@@ woman for the U.S. embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the AF@@ P news agency on 27 June that the embassy asked the Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u but also to free his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from house arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the US embassy request drew a fur@@ ious response from China , with the statement of the State Department that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country has the right to interfere and make ir@@ responsible remarks about Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pol@@ ley told that China should offer the couple the following :
protection and freedom , such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of his choice , to which they claim according to the Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international obligations .
the US sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz have also adopted a decision in Congress to urge the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condi@@ tionally .
I urge China to release the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ condi@@ tionally so that he can embar@@ k on a proper medical treatment . ht@@ t@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany Please contact us
the German government spokesperson , Steffen Sei@@ bert , wrote on July 3 , Berlin hopes that Li@@ u will receive all the medical support he needs and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot;
the Chinese President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping appeared on 7 and 8 July at the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg .
previously , diplomatic sources reported in Peking from the news agency Reu@@ ters that China had big concerns about whether the vor@@ tex of Li@@ u could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg .
Canada - Canada
on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um asked China to provide Li@@ u with appropriate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family .
Li@@ u lawyer told AF@@ P previously that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always monitored the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to talk to someone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact .
Mc@@ Call@@ um further talks :
Canada calls on China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , and to release the freedom to exercise these rights .
France and France
France &apos;s Foreign Ministry asked China to release Li@@ u on humanitarian grounds in a declaration on 29 June :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all the treatments he needs , regardless of where . furthermore , his wife and his family should have contact with him .
although the news channel France Info has already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there is no further information about whether France would eventually receive it .
Taiwan Holiday with dog
the Council of Rural Affairs in Taiwan demanded China on 27 June release Li@@ u and show a greater tolerance towards those seeking peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development .
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legislature , Yu M@@ ei @-@ n@@ u , from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party , also called on China to allow the sick intellectual Li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , expressed himself very much in an explanation on June 28 around Li@@ u and admitted that many have asked him to pray for Li@@ us well @-@ being .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for whom he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious , more stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world .
I personally felt very moved and also encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , signed the Charter 08 which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognized as an independent state on an international level .
but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore should be considered a city .
this re@@ mark has spark@@ ed a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the State of New York , the Minister stressed that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of the only political party in Singapore because it compared Singapore to other countries .
he supports Singapore to be considered a city .
... no one asked if New York was a democracy ...
this is what most people make a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o blog accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twist the logic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land , we hear that ultimately we are not a country .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a breach of duty .
Singapore , if you &apos;re not my country , whose land is it then ?
the reasons cited by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were not very no@@ bel : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in view of it , it seemed inevitably un@@ democratic .
on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently led by a party .
these cities are democratic .
as soon as one reaches the core of the subject , the good old ly@@ re pop@@ s up from the author@@ itarian rulers who pre@@ tend to be democr@@ ats , leave the twi@@ sted logic , since it fits better to their power .
in the end the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam was given answers to his American guests regarding our press , our judi@@ ci@@ ary , and our political system really non @-@ answers .
he obj@@ ected to relevant questions in a rational manner with non @-@ answers .
Rachel Z@@ eng requests Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam to clarify his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion .
personally , I find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
when Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to which country belongs our city ...
in short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very grateful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam would take the trouble to clear this point , if he was paid high to be part of the government of the City of Singapore .
by publishing his commentary on the blog , he points out to the critics that one should start reading the whole tran@@ script of the conference so that one can better understand the context of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country .
read the tran@@ script .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore is more of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore are so un@@ equal , even if we enjoy free and just choices . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Singapore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he obviously did not mean it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his disappointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , who as the leader of a growing generation , makes such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement .
I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore had said ...
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Guard I expected - I agree or not , but this is another matter .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes this , properly associates and is aware of what he is defending .
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review de@@ bits the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; did Mr Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good faith a mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian @-@ spokes@@ man ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Singapore is not a country , we are only considered an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , on which country are the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally country and city .
as he plays an important role within the Cab@@ inet , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam are of serious importance .
why do the people of Singapore afford their military service , but do they not defend their city but their country ?
who must pay our prime minister bills ?
what is the value of our pink identity card ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade is ten@@ ding to affir@@ m , Singapore is and has always been a city :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t say what I said ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sentence seems to have anno@@ yed many Singap@@ ore@@ ans ...
nobody ever said Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defense of the country &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but this is not quite correct . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather speak of the defence of the city .

global Vo@@ ices wonder@@ ed recently : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home or home country ?
your answers will be published here as part of a continuing series , with which rum@@ ors about certain parts of the world are revealed and another fac@@ et is to be shown .
the latest part of this series is written by Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
the question most asked me in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 1994 I live in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on the situation in which the conversation takes place , it is considered pol@@ ite to show interest in the conversation partner by asking personal questions .
&quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; many Can@@ adi@@ ans maybe cook inside anger when they are thought for Americans but I don &apos;t mind that .
for someone who does not know himself , there is little that is different to us Can@@ adi@@ ans of Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans get a Canadian flag visible on their ruck@@ sack when they travel .
all dear Can@@ adi@@ ans .
Americans , on the other hand ... .
so it was already when I started to travel around the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 .
Can@@ adi@@ ans have always carried little map@@ le leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free healthcare system !
there are no weapons with us !
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
all seem to think Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we obviously say very often &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is said to be the most toler@@ ant country towards ethnic groups .
we are not like these guys south of the border .
we Can@@ adi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
first , I have many American friends I admire very much .
I wouldn &apos;t mind if you were confused with Johnny from Dallas for example .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u .
but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot;
first , to be called &quot; nice &quot; means to be idle , like the ben@@ ign , gentle but tra@@ gically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; Die Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has a Canadian Doppel@@ gän@@ ger ) .
if Canada was really a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , this would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing you can encounter .
being harmless means being un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive and un@@ interesting and not paying attention .
this can be a good thing if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , away from things that happen around you .
I would even go to say that the desire to be free and alone is a major part of the Can@@ adi@@ ans .
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may be simply a cool courtesy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans often talk about the fence across the fence .
we lack the warm , open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends .
luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) Jus@@ tin Tru@@ deau entered the stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada sexy .
music video of a pop band par@@ o@@ dies Thailand &apos;s j@@ un@@ ta
a pop band , famous in Thailand , has released a music video that par@@ o@@ dies the j@@ un@@ ta , which in 2014 took power and , despite its promise to restore the civilian government , continues to rule the country .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the Band Tat@@ too Colour describes a young man who tells of what prec@@ ep@@ ts his girlfriend makes .
although not explicitly political , the music video still refers indirectly to the continued military rule of the Jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country &apos;s situation .
the video to the song was a huge success .
within the first three days , the video uploaded to Facebook was 1,@@ 25@@ 4 times shared and received 8,@@ 800 kes .
last month even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists invited the public to watch this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , particularly in relation to the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule .
take a look at these videos , which refer to some of the political issues that Thailand has persist@@ ently pursued over the past three years .
the &quot; 44 Rules of the Girls &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the provisional constitution granting absolute decision making on important national issues to the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th rule : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change your attitude &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the not@@ orious programme of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change of imagination &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people who are considered critics of the Jun@@ ta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and unclear rules are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit was set up in the army to monitor online content and to prosec@@ ute persons accused of having slan@@ dered the monarchy .
Thailand uses a strict regime against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ ority offen@@ se ) .
on 20 May 2014 , martial law was declared in Thailand .
two days later it came to a coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
one of the problems the Jun@@ ta continues to pursue is its decision to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money .
in the video it is even shown how people are thrown into a black van , before putting them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem .
some journalists are in prison because they allegedly created &quot; confusion &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened with long prison sentences , they should off@@ end the monarchy .
meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the song showed members of the band who im@@ itated the Sal@@ ute from &quot; The Hunger Games , &quot; which was already used by put@@ sch opponents during the protests in 2014 .
life continues in the ruins of the gh@@ ost towns in eastern Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia

the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ no@@ v , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with kind permission .
the post@@ war society reco@@ vers only very slowly in East @-@ East @-@ Asia , especially in the district T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
over 20 years have passed since the Geor@@ gian @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ as@@ sic war has been officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still visible in this part of the republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking images .
villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ i are located in the hydro@@ massage of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , Ab@@ a@@ ha@@ zia , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together on Soviet sites in the area .
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today , the biggest part of the Russians and the Ab@@ ch@@ asen live in the area .
such settlements are also called gh@@ ost towns in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
during the pre @-@ war period more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these gh@@ ost@@ s .
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the district amounted to 16@@ ,000 people , having hardly increased over a decade .
in 1989 about 4@@ 3.000 people lived in this district .

&quot; all this is a consequence of the war &quot;
the empty five @-@ storey building blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s , called ch@@ ry@@ os@@ h@@ kov@@ cas , are symbolic of the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are exp@@ and@@ able and very rarely inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha village I met a native older man .
he starts a conversation and it is difficult for him to end this .
&quot; all this is a consequence of the war . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is nevertheless clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
there were community centres , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens that all served the community .
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded magni@@ fic@@ ence buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union have now left the district .
in the gh@@ ost town D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , about fifty inhabitants live .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the ch@@ ry@@ th@@ ch@@ ow@@ ka , which still houses one or two families , can be seen on the balconies where washing is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover me with the camera in my hand , they withdraw immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our mother forbidden us to take pictures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she simply banned us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her friend and suddenly she leaves the destroyed building and van@@ ishes .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for personal use ) such as cattle breeding , be@@ eke@@ eping and vegetable cultivation .
it is difficult to get over the rounds .
in winter , district administration provides free candles and bread to the villages .

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build zu@@ c@@ ch@@ ini &quot;
about ten years ago an older woman named Gal@@ ina ( or a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a as she is called in the neighborhood ) moved from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in spite of her el@@ dest daughter living in France , Gal@@ ina did not leave Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia to live with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my heart will remain in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia for ever , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gal@@ ina doesn &apos;t want to receive financial aid from her daughter and insi@@ sts that she supports her young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ inas &apos;s monthly pen@@ sions are just nine dollars .
&quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; she says .
a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a tells that she and other vill@@ agers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman as well as a young family and I live in this building .
when holidays are , we visit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but we cannot do this all the time - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while she tells her story , a younger neighbour appears on the balcony .
&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; says a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a to her . &quot; they said we could build zu@@ c@@ ch@@ ini .
I have already prepared the ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we &apos;ll build zu@@ c@@ ch@@ ini . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ a &apos;s convers@@ ation@@ alist Nat@@ ascha lived together with her husband and the five common children in their home for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she reminds herself of the village life before the war .
despite the relatives living in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia simply broke away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital city in Ab@@ ch@@ sia ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but it will take some time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ ascha is awarded $ 9 child allowance for each child .
her husband is working in the coal mines .
the young family has its own farm .
near the house where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten was once there , they keep pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chi@@ ckens .
she tells us that it was a very frigh@@ tening situation when many people left the village after the war .
but over time she lost her anxi@@ ousness .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark road or the few people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
in fact , it rather has something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war there was hardly any work and all lived as it was right .
every day I remember how the city and the war were once . &quot;
when our conversation ends , a little boy conf@@ esses us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hides .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ases after him .
he plays with the ball , which then rolls down the hill .
a group of children now pursu@@ es the ball .
while they run , some of them throw stones on the fallen buildings .
these ruins are part of their childhood , which ensure lack of comfort in their lives .
they don &apos;t know it differently .

in Mexico , &quot; Mama Africa &quot; houses migrants on their long journey
Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez direc@@ ts a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala .

this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on April 19 , 2017 on the website of our partner P@@ RI@@ .org and appears here with kind permission .
on the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America , certain places for their hospitality will be known .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , located at the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is led by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink frame and golden earrings in t@@ ed@@ dy bears .
she is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is owed to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) became a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
for about $ 2.@@ 50 per night guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and metal beds .
in the vesti@@ bu@@ le there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - yet hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants come here .
sometimes , Ms Ram@@ í@@ rez nar@@ rates , the people come to full small bus@@ ses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to call : &quot; Mama Africa !
where are you from Mama Africa ? . &quot;
at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year , Ram@@ í@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have already slept on boxes outside .
she doesn &apos;t want to reject anybody .
she also helps them and brings them to the hospital if they are ill , they buy drugs that they can &apos;t pay , they massage them with a bal@@ m the feet exhausted by the long journey .
Ty@@ ch@@ que Sebas@@ ti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived recently .
I asked him if Mama Africa was an appropriate nick@@ name for Ms Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the Sebas@@ ti@@ ao family ( with their daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ che ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel it suits her , because African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebas@@ ti@@ ao travels with his sister who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children .
they have already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north@@ wards .
the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the route , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti .
he says that the Hai@@ tians and the Afri@@ cans are often traveling together and that the Afri@@ cans are already talking about W@@ hat@@ s@@ app by Ms Ram@@ í@@ rez .
like many of his companions , Michel@@ et has lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker for construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy became weaker , it began its journey to the United States .
he has been guest with Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I wonder if he will have contact with Mr@@ s Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again , &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez says that their guests often send text messages when they have gone to greet them or to report about the course of their trip .
she explains that their Christian faith is the driving force of their work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken as in Ghana .
Mr@@ s Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city leads a cu@@ l de sa@@ c to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family immig@@ rated to their small house .
he is a polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African immigrants are sold too expensive .
he has begun to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his home for a dollar the night .
at the moment there are 25 persons , mainly Hai@@ tians .
some sleep on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a kitchen area outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I experienced what they are experiencing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I crossed the border across the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . that &apos;s why I give them my support . &quot;
after living for three years , he was exp@@ elled from the United States after a raid on his job .
the majority of migrants traveling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , other residents also open doors to their homes for them .
José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ é@@ n@@ dez tells me that he has fled to Honduras with his wife and three children from people who wanted to black@@ mail him without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown person , a single educ@@ ator , offered him a roof .
a few months later the family still lives there and tries to decide where the next step is to go .
back in the house of Mama Afrika everything is full of guests .
in the cor@@ rid@@ ors , travelers consult their phones cal@@ m@@ ly .
a mini@@ bus arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , a large part of Somalia .
Mr@@ s Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic because of those who have gone away .
like a proud grand@@ mother she leaves in her album with numerous photos .
there is one of her daughter with African hair pla@@ ys she has made a female client , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old .
she laughs sadly , while she introduces her to me .
Ya se fu@@ er@@ on , repe@@ ats it every time . &quot; you have gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a monitoring app on their mobile phones .
a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang from Twitter users .
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minorities area in western China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phones .
on July 10 , the mobile phone users in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an district of Ur@@ um@@ qi received a mobile notification in which they instruc@@ t the district government to install a monitoring app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Clean &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the announcement , it is said that the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevents access to terrorist information &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the authorities appl@@ au@@ ded the app for more than fighting terrorism .
according to an exclusive report from Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ f@@ ecture because , shortly after they had installed the app , they had exchanged news with a private chat group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said that the app would identify and prosec@@ ute the sources and distribution channels of terrorists , along with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal religious &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; activities and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; harmful information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; including videos , images , e@@ Books and documents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang &apos;s website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elec@@ om .
the main feature is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic websites , from online sc@@ ams , tro@@ j@@ ans , and ph@@ ishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online , and to remotely control their home network .
this app with the min@@ ors &apos; filters will help children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even h@@ ack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate the home network of a person or steal it from it .
this introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
while messages about digital cens@@ orship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south , reality is very often glo@@ omy for those living in remote , repres@@ sed ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ content in conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme cens@@ ors and surveillance measures as well as routine internet ab@@ sten@@ tions .
the media outlet &quot; Images from mainland China &quot; ( previously published on Twitter ) , the cens@@ ored news in China , showed photos of a check@@ point where police inspec@@ tors checked in@@ discrimin@@ ately whether they had installed the monitoring app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile alert demanded that people install the app within 10 days .
if you are discovered on a check@@ point with a device without this software , you might be imprisoned for up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced people to use devices intended for older people .
this is a form of captivity by the rest @-@ growth technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from mainland China &quot; also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , from which the software can lift the password demand of a Windows operating system and thus get unlimited access to the hard drive of the computer .
after the installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic cu@@ ffs .
the J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang rules may be a response to the instructions given by the City Council to minim@@ ise the dis@@ semination of illegal content .
all government branches , authorities and institutions affiliated with the party , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office during operation of their computers and communication devices .
a recent Freedom House report , an American human rights organisation , also mentioned these new surveillance methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , on June 27 , in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi , the authorities issued an ordin@@ ance with the directive to all residents and entrepreneurs , until 1 August register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks , and media memory cards &quot; at the local police .
the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist &quot; videos . however , this action viol@@ ates the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole series of possible off@@ enses , including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages .
sleep or Death , Part 1 : everything cri@@ es after death

&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sleep or death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane described his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
far from our blue , virtual world you look at yourself and realize that you are all alone in a place where everything important has disappeared .
everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth that is clearly recognis@@ able both from inside and outside .
one that makes her name all honor .
one who has kno@@ cked down a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow met@@ aph@@ ors .
but if the reality reco@@ vers and you look behind the scenes - beyond the act@@ ress , the beautiful scenes and the actors , the characters turn into beings of flesh and blood , and everything cri@@ es after death .
all doubts arise in smoke and you will be aware of your existence , even if the earth moves on the axis of the un@@ holy . it becomes clear to you that you are trapped between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone have built stone .
they have arrested me and my father three times , but that was not enough for me to &quot; learn my lesson , &quot; as the chief of the security service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he proved his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew .
five teenagers were torn from the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest like we@@ eds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was sufficient for the city to sh@@ atter the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the neighbor@@ hoods were cov@@ eted , only my own did not .
for the first time , it was still , mo@@ tion@@ less , at the wrong time , even if I had no high demands on a city that is stu@@ ffed into the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their accompli@@ ces .
during the third night things had cal@@ med down somewhat after the power supply stopped functioning in the neighborhood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I broke the silence by scre@@ aming several times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from my house roof . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I heard my voice reson@@ ated through the silence .
a few minutes later , some of my friends felt brave enough to come together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me ; we united to a gorgeous picture that filled my expectations completely and completely .
at such a moment you are aware that you release the spirit from the lamp , but it is just not interested in the slightest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet with the military security building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he put on .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low - nothing can give you your voice return after you scre@@ amed it all the way to the security service office .
I arrived there .
the Col@@ onel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I now .
the Col@@ onel Gh@@ ass@@ an starts speaking : &quot; let me also hear how you write &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; or you are only brave enough to scre@@ am when we are not near . &quot;
his eyes filled with hatred set on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you dare to see me in my eyes and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time that I stood in front of this building .
perhaps it was in my fol@@ ly , vanity ; perhaps in the revolution .
I was so sure of my cause when I answered , &quot; I hadn &apos;t thought that you &apos;ve forgotten my voice since yesterday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I think I &apos;ve never stopped looking at you , so why should I do it now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the shortest conversation that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I regret not a word about what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put him in sol@@ itary confin@@ ement and his father with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his father is equal to it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cursed sentence lies in my nose today .
he became a &quot; syndrome , &quot; a mental torture that I had been exposed for months .
I went through the yard .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with me .
then back through the courtyard and into the second office which leads through a corridor leading to the individual cells .
I present all details exactly before I enter the room .
unlike anything else , they probably have allocated me a larger cell this time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to share it with just one more prisoner , and may set me straight away without waiting for her permission . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the officer left the cell and I grab@@ bed an old @-@ tried communication method : to beat the fist against the wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my cellular com@@ rade was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; First Pre@@ t@@ ess &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after long hes@@ itation he answered me in the end .
apparently there was in none of the surrounding cells a respected middle @-@ aged man who looks similar to me and is called &quot; the doctor . &quot;
in perfect darkness , no striking facial features can be seen on me , and doctors are not there ; we are all numbers only .
&quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds like mine ? &quot;
all the answers deny his existence .
perhaps he was moved to one of the large cells .
perhaps he will stop immediately .
the investig@@ ator assured me that they would leave him if I remained .
li@@ ars .
I would have liked to have a scar@@ ec@@ row in order to dispos@@ s@@ ess all these crow@@ s from the fruit of the garden of my head .
from a distance I still hear them scre@@ am &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar . &quot;
it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the cri@@ es rang , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black is the colour of per@@ dition until I saw the yellow light that showed us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( for example : &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; all@@ usion to the 13th pro@@ stitute of the Koran ) .
&quot; they are here to be inter@@ ro@@ gated . &quot;
thus the secret was revealed : to protect the state security from us and prevent us from expos@@ ing the tra@@ it@@ or and terrorists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dialect - so they played their denom@@ inations and betra@@ yed the narrow field of view of their world@@ view .
this is not a house here , which is not a country ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to turn the criminals of their clan into a hero .
I enter the listening room and meet me on Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he feels like that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he starts a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant conversation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; despite the facial expressions that ro@@ de him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my boy , you are young , you can start so much more important with your life than to join those Ta@@ ge@@ thi@@ eves and protest against demonstrations that will soon come to an end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not answer .
I got used to it , not to answer .
I can no longer say exactly when insul@@ ts and blows have become an ordinary communication instrument after a friendly conversation .
when and how that happened was un@@ important .
some voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished , although I had done nothing to earn this penalty .
on punishment in all its variety .
his command is to tear me as much flesh as possible from the body .
he calls the aff@@ ection@@ ate &quot; con@@ fession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe that probably comes from the clo@@ aks .
your exec@@ ution@@ er delights in your cry .
give him the pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him and you cannot hold your cry back .
my scre@@ ams didn &apos;t fall enough to him why they exchanged the tube by a cable .
at my first arrest , I asked myself whether the investig@@ ator had previously worked as a waste collector or whether it belonged to the normal work equipment .
they had inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables in order to present us the great invention of a huge cable from their point of view .
within a single hour , three of them altern@@ ated while I was still in turn .
I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I stopped scre@@ aming .
the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling down and didn &apos;t really like it , which is why he picked up an electrically charged stick .
electricity flow@@ ed all my body , enough to supply my whole area .
my half naked body stretched out to the ground was the perfect conductor .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was there again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
it must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
a few hours passed that came to me like minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fu@@ cker . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted young man : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my Father must be fear@@ ful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be quiet and walk away , you will be laid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had always left me free .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian ra@@ pper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of the LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and opposition
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time inside ; sometimes he locks to his screen , sometimes to his computer , back and again to his couch .
but what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his ni@@ cot@@ ine qu@@ aked lip .
he lives in the highest floor of his family house , which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year when Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s family was forced to escape from their village in Palestine , where they lived as fel@@ lows ( e.g. : farmers ) .
for six years now H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who faces the conservative majority and questioned their well @-@ established opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rape .
with his music , which often deals with topics such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world . all these topics are not only relevant in his home town of Am@@ man , but also in cities that range from Damascus in Syria to San@@ aa in Yemen .
with his 25 years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not limited by boundaries in his thinking and can feel with people who suffer from the disa@@ strous consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he does not openly admit it , he h@@ ates a special a@@ version to the US foreign policy .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones , have anything to do with his identity as &quot; Palestinian refugees of the second generation , &quot; he describes himself even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think so because of my own circumstances , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ da@@ i@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think so because I am a man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while he sh@@ akes in water dissolved N@@ es@@ café into two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan ; at this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the consumption of food during the Ram@@ adan is illegal .
obviously H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee on a scor@@ ching hot young day has little to do with protest against Islam .
basically the pieces of lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the che@@ ers of the K@@ ent @-@ cigarette in the nose speak primarily of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky , especially when you take a look at the neighbouring countries .
hence , it is easy to avoid basic things - as drinking in the public during the Ram@@ adan Water - in order not to land in prison .
recently , the Interior Ministry announced a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , already for the second time .
some MPs who support the Islamic Front of Action - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ exual fron@@ ts@@ man Ham@@ ed Sen@@ o , contradic@@ ts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the concert .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Euro MPs and former press spokesperson for the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert had been cancelled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the sexual orientation of the singer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many argue that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which demands the proven legitim@@ acy of author@@ itarian regimes across the region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la estimated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; who continue to choose &quot; for intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement might not simply be shallow rhet@@ oric , but actually reflect an increasingly clear @-@ cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan , which appears clearly in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s work .
in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b returned to traditional gender standards by forming his vision of the fate of Arab women who have pre@@ mar@@ ital sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an unknown woman , whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the canvas .
it is surrounded by a red sea ; perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should trust .
in recent years , the number of &quot; honorary mor@@ als &quot; has increased in Jordan - the un@@ official outside .
according to Human Rights Watch , the number of honorary mor@@ als reached its peak in 2016 ; however , it is still app@@ alling that Jordan is lacking the institutional infrastructure to support the women who have attempted murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way .
according to a law to fight crime from 1954 , women who are exposed to the risk of in@@ tra @-@ family violence can &quot; be held in prison in@@ definitely , &quot; and for their release it is often necessary to have years of bureaucratic expenditure and the family &apos;s guarantee that nothing will happen to the woman .
even H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s music enjoys great popularity and is known to not shy away from issues that were long considered tab@@ oo in his country .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b denied that his work is political , but ad@@ mits that he cannot separate his music , which is full of explicit references to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; politics has been given to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a song called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b tackl@@ ed the question of Palestinian identity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; the focus is on poverty .
the list of songs that are political in the core can be continued .
in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b released a song titled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song one verse frequently repe@@ ats itself :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the further course of the song , H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market in which one , in his words , &quot; can get what you want &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ faith , hetero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality .
he notes that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay men and les@@ bi@@ ans and that comments on gender equality between LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals have been cens@@ ored until 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya , in order to later mem@@ ori@@ ze that his comments were torn out of context , distorted and in his opinion cens@@ ored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Youtube , it was uploaded without cuts , but only a edited version , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b is campaig@@ ning openly for the Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and believes intoler@@ ance does not correspond to Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ what , a poet of the eighth century , still remembered today thanks to his homo@@ erotic poetry .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ what , who was supposed to work on behalf of the cali@@ ph , was able to write openly about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ ani@@ ans not ?
the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was canc@@ eled .
in the H@@ ash@@ em@@ ite Kingdom there is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced .
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service held several former government officials and members of the teacher association , argu@@ ing that in social media comments , they were critical of the problems related to the corruption rooted in the country .
in view of this , H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s opinion is only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans .
for him progress is a constant giving and taking . Jordan did not def@@ y M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - this is H@@ da@@ i@@ b - consists of slow , thou@@ ghtful and internal changes . he is sure that these changes take place every day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society .
in the end H@@ da@@ i@@ b dreams , like millions of other Arabs , from an Arab world without any intervention from abroad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is not only dre@@ aming of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experiencing them &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the region will be approached by music , art and literature of a genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs , cluster muni@@ tions and arti@@ fici@@ ally @-@ made demo@@ cra@@ cies . at least he hopes this .
until it is ready , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to ra@@ p and therefore resist .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
these big , extravag@@ ant war@@ d@@ olls are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
one assumes that it is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually also celebrated in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us in August . another theory states that the flo@@ ats , drums and dancing have been handed over more than one thousand years ago , in the armies of the west Japan mar@@ ched into the Nor@@ theast to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the em@@ iss@@ hi , to knees .
we are at the Neb@@ ula Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to grab some great seats , so we have a great view .
one can only imagine how large these parts are ...
a community centre in the capital city , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( wör@@ th .
I have been looking at Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two fixed cars are just to be seen .
nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend his summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and looked at the # Neb@@ uch@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 meter high car was incredible .
let us enjoy the rest of the summer !
young Peru@@ ans trade weapons against scissors and razor blades

external appearance and body care were rarely as important as in this history because they help keep the Peru@@ vian youth out of crime and promote a legitimate profession like that of the hair@@ dresser .
El Call@@ ao , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of Lima , a region with a very high crime rate , where street rau@@ b and illegal drug trade are omni@@ present .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe .
at the same time , Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - experienced an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend to copy the appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sports@@ men such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) has led to becoming more and more normal citizens into the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers who can recre@@ ate these complex hair@@ styles .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of the hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 .
there experts compete against each other to show who can create the most ec@@ centric looks , as you can see in the following video ( more videos to current cont@@ ests are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as the August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy School , located in El Call@@ ao , found an opportunity to persu@@ ade young people to swa@@ p their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and receive training in the art of hair@@ dressing , which enables them to find work .
motivated by this activity and the possibilities offered , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion .
before the school year beginning in March , the school offered special training workshops and reported some of their successes :
in 1995 , we were the only school in the community and the district , which we are very proud of because of love for the children we have built this educational community .
Colombia : love letters to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters
photo : Valent@@ ina Mon@@ sal@@ ve .
use with kind permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the following article is the edited version of the contribution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Love messages to guer@@ illa fighters &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; published by the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people we know ?
is it not even more important to accommodate people who feel exp@@ elled , affection ?
exactly this question left the young Colum@@ bian activ@@ ist Leonardo P@@ ár@@ ra@@ ga not anymore from the Bog@@ ot@@ Art Foundation and Cris@@ tian Pal@@ aci@@ os by the Young @-@ Youth Foundation and inspired them to write letters to the campaign Cart@@ as p@@ or la Rec@@ on@@ ci@@ li@@ aci@@ ón ( Let@@ ters to Rec@@ on@@ ci@@ liation ) , encouraging young people to write letters to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters .
only recently , their country was the scene of a historic event , and they wanted to contribute to it : after years of negotiations the Colom@@ bian government had signed a peace treaty with the guer@@ ri@@ lla movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary Ar@@ med Forces of Colombia ) , which forms the end of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
internationally , the signing of the Peace Treaty was so important that Colom@@ bian President José Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its .
however , in front of the Colom@@ bi@@ ans there is a long way to talk about true reconciliation and peace .
guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , who have lived in illegal camps for many years , were subjected to war rhet@@ oric and carried their weapons around the clock , must now be integrated into life as civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society , which has become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred of guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , must now take these into their ranks and support them in building a new life .
Leonardo and Cris@@ tian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bi@@ ans would join together and help the integration process .
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : up to now thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guer@@ illa fighters to welcome them back in society .
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter - who will then be handed over personally .
Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the Let@@ ters to Rec@@ on@@ ci@@ liation was created at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bog@@ ot@@ á in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cris@@ tian had the opportunity to talk briefly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ th@@ i , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love on Valentine &apos;s Day , but those who need them much more .
he plans to share his love with people that needed most urgent attention this year .
the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former F@@ ARC fighters who now find their place in society and build up a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history a common history of peace , &quot; she says .
up to now more than 2,000 letters were collected within the framework of the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities in Colombia , such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á .
&apos;@@ i never thought someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on 19 March .
a group of 40 students from the University Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Bog@@ ot@@ Art Foundation traveled to the camp to personally transfer the letters .
the members of the F@@ ARC arose as they had done earlier in order to accept the orders of their leaders .
but this time they received no orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and all that lies in between &quot; told the political scientist Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the governor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience :
after passing the letters , a former warri@@ or led me through the camp of guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters .
when I looked into one of the &quot; Cam@@ b@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the guer@@ ri@@ ll@@ as live ) I saw a guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter who wrote something .
I was afraid to go in , because next to him lay a M@@ GL gar@@ net , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I asked him anyway and asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ello , what are they doing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer a letter that someone wrote to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; never in my life someone wrote something so beautiful , so I answer it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly my tears ran over the che@@ eks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I hu@@ g@@ ged him completely and sat down beside the gar@@ net .
perhaps he was sorry for the war , it was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this warri@@ or , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything else from life than war . joining the F@@ ARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers before Hung@@ er@@ to@@ d . &quot; I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a society outside , waiting for us with open arms .
until now I have only learned how to deal with weapons .
but now where peace reig@@ ns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices and voices
at the beginning students and some of the F@@ ARC leaders met for a discussion .
the students were all grown up as already war and the F@@ ARC were already in secret .
this is why the leaders of the F@@ ARC stated the history of the organisation , its ide@@ als , and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have experienced how social injustice on the part of the state looked upon the entire Colom@@ bian people . now that we have the opportunity to develop ourselves into a political party , we can help make society more just in this country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a goal of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
to hear those people who have never found a hearing and had no right to vote , and to realize that the people I have often seen as monsters , and even hate people with beautiful feelings , which were turned around through their living circumstances and their environment , was very painful for me .
the reality in which the country lives , hur@@ ts me .
but it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and have done so much harm , can teach us something and give a smile and a hu@@ g .
many former fighters responded to the letters .
Gust@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , the camp &apos;s commander in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote the following letter to the Archbishop of Cal@@ i , the Archbishop of Cal@@ i :
the Colom@@ bi@@ ans were made aware that peace would reign after dis@@ arm@@ ament .
but this is not the case .
as long as there is ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people willing to resort to arms , raise up and protest for their rights . and that is also completely justified ( ... ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we of the F@@ ARC now rely on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is why we call all def@@ enders of peace - whatever race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices , for we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . for those of us who defend life as the basis of existence , many difficulties will be im@@ min@@ ent .

hom@@ os@@ exual and qu@@ eer people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
with terror , activists have witnessed the reporting of the last months on the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat posed as a sword of Dam@@ o@@ cles on the local LGB@@ T@@ Q community has not come into existence only overnight .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ z@@ ny who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is happening in the republic .
several months ago , the LGB@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has won international head@@ lines after reports have been published that address the deport@@ ation , torture and killing of qu@@ eer men in the Republic .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Now@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities who arrested suspi@@ cious qu@@ eer men and put them into secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; you have brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a Trans@@ woman , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny and grew up there .
since her childhood she felt that she was actually a woman .
when she grew up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , why she moved to Moscow .
after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens experienced the gender equality of their land@@ lady , the hunt for Sab@@ rina was opened .
she moved out of fear about her life in the United States .
Sab@@ rina : I worked as a volunteer in a human rights organisation .
one day I was told that someone needed my help .
it was a friend from Da@@ gest@@ an , a woman who was in trouble .
she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , someone I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it anywhere in the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent her to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no more men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya who can remove this shame ? &quot;
after that , the photos from my documents were made by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App .
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
when I was doing a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying , &quot; Here is a gift for you from your unc@@ le . &quot;
when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I didn &apos;t hurt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time in Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long will you still honor your family , you sc@@ andal ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not know the person .
I only know that it was a young man , not 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and woke up last end in the hospital .
apparently , some women had received everything and started to scre@@ am .
the man was fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I learned that I had two wounds in my right lung .
OC Media : in which cases were you laid - in which of the men or the women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are out of date , there &apos;s still my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and put me to the women .
I am very thank@@ ful for that .
when I read his name for the first time in his office , I was afraid to do it ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name .
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him for being respect@@ ful of me .
I spent more than a month in hospital .
last February I received threats .
they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives .
they demanded to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that it was all a lie .
they asked me absurd demands : some told me that I had to prove it by running through the streets up above ; others wanted me to appear on the official television in Gro@@ z@@ ny and say that I didn &apos;t change my gender , that everything was just bad , and Photos@@ hop .
I have grain size C - what would I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for them .
some older people once spoke my mother on the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They have brought a monster to the world that has not only damaged your family , but the entire Republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot;
it was too much for my mother and she put a rope around her neck .
fortunately , the neighbors came and saved them .
at that time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later , under the window was a car with dark@@ ened windows and a number plate with a 95 .
after it had happened for the third time , it became clear to me that something was la@@ zy .
my human rights friends checked the number plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you fly ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with their help I left the country , but then something incredible happened .
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived .
I bought it without registering myself , without identification , without anything .
I broke my old SIM card and threw them into the garbage .
arrived and checked in to the hotel .
the number was registered for a stranger .
I plug@@ ged the SIM card into my mobile phone .
at the moment when I wanted to call my mother via W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t believe you &apos;re in safety just because you left the country ?
our people know in which hotel you are stuck . they even know your room number .
only to prove it to you : it is the number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine that ? !
this was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
but we don &apos;t talk about the gender equality which is a tab@@ oo subject .
I still wear some traditional Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements in me .
as much as I wish , I cannot overcome this mental barrier .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her .
when we chat with camera , I really try to look at the person they remember from their past - that is , my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends do , those who have stayed there ?
Sab@@ rina : I filed a report in Washington last week .
for this I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information on the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who had imprisoned in ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
he told that no people were arrested and tor@@ tured during the Ram@@ adan , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he did not lock a new wave .
most likely they will now focus on family and relatives .
with that , I mean , they probably invite relatives , these take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end demand a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has experienced through blood satisfaction .
OC Media : are gay men still trapped in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says there are just not many .
if , above all , those who have no wealthy relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives in order to stand for Kad@@ y@@ rows &apos;s judgment .
as far as I know , they are held there so that they can present them later as terrorists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they are killed , they will show their bodies on television and claim they had attacked any village or military base . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
as if these people had not simply disappeared , they were deliberately immersed in order to radic@@ alise themselves .
OC Media : is that just a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was imprisoned in ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
he says that many people disappeared in this prison after their be@@ ard had grown .
there has been nothing new from them ever since .
they simply took them with them .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was even when these people were taken along .
up to now they were not presented as ban@@ dits , but there have been no reports so far . however , we suspect that such actions are quite possible .
why else would it not have allowed these people to shave ?
do you know whether these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people belonging to a so @-@ called &quot; non@@ traditional &quot; orientation have already occurred in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a bo@@ b .
I think already before 2003 I was already known in Gro@@ z@@ ny , when I still lived there - and I never had any problems .
in ear@@ nest !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when Sh@@ aria was considered , I had never had any problems .
on the contrary , at that time it was much safer than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia wanted to introduce us to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civili@@ sation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but eventually threw us back into the Stone Age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is it possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had tin@@ ted lashes , bore tube @-@ je@@ ans and short tops .
the Ministry of Defence of Sh@@ aria has never weakened my hair .
before the Russian Theatre in Gro@@ z@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially weekends , met a whole group of people like me .
it was a small place where several benches were standing , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there .
we have never been offen@@ ded .
in the Ch@@ echn@@ ya language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; Don &apos;t laugh at the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
it is often said to children when they are funny about sick people .
OC Media : so they shut their eyes closed because they thought you were ill ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they never insul@@ ted me , never hun@@ ted and never beaten .
OC Media : how long held this time of grace ?
Sab@@ rina : until Kad@@ y@@ rov stepped onto the plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to talk about morality on television .
he spoke not about us per se , but primarily about the behaviour of women .
nevertheless - you could feel how people started to change in the city .
those who had smil@@ ed and laugh@@ ed at once looked at you with suspicion .
in time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home , I could feel the situation in the republic steadily deteri@@ or@@ ated .
OC Media : what activity do you do now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn a lot - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US .
apart from that , I am still active as an activ@@ ist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organize tea ste@@ aks , gather@@ ings , I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food types .
I don &apos;t spend a cent for it .
I have discovered these people myself when I shut off the type of refuge .
I am Muslims and I want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you have a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that is sil@@ ly .
this is Nature , it has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens who want to white you with foam in front of the mouth that there are no bo@@ ils with them .
the Da@@ ge@@ stan@@ es have which , the cab@@ ard@@ ines have which , the Russians have also which ; on the whole planet they exist - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I come from there , so it &apos;s unpleasant for me to hear something like that .
I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us here .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the Mos@@ que and fast during Ram@@ adan - live together with men .
know , many think of Transi@@ ber@@ ty to men who love men , and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that is a fall@@ acy .
these are two different things - two different ways of feeling , to be precise , different attitudes of life .
for me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
I &apos;m sorry I &apos;m going to be so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I &apos;m not sad at all - I just know that I am myself now .
local groups warn against an increase of suicide in the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
over the past few months there has been a strong increase in suicide .
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ ra@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on 27 August drew the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi community in Iran which is shaped by poverty and unemployment , into the li@@ mel@@ i@@ ght .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the Ah@@ ra@@ z region in the southwest of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , inability to pay for his family , so Ah@@ ra@@ zi &apos;s human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ ra@@ z and remain anonymous .
a video shared on YouTube held the moments after he had ign@@ ited himself .
some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the fl@@ ames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in Ah@@ ra@@ z .
according to local sources , the burns were so strong that doctors were unable to do anything anymore .
he died short time later .
it was not the only suicide that happened in August within the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi minority , and activists on site warn that more men could take life .
the Ah@@ ra@@ zi Centre for Human Rights reported that several others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - reported this month .
their stories have one thing in common : they were all family fathers who were hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families because of the persecution on the part of the Iranian government .
Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , in which a large part of the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi community living in Iran , was shaken by a profound economic crisis , which makes it difficult for the native Arab population to deny its livel@@ ihood .
a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ la@@ vi monarchy assumed power and in 1925 under@@ took great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran , as well as some of the most profitable and valuable land for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy is still developing only slowly , and the native population has little of this wealth .
it is often the victim of un@@ treated diseases , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation .
the Iranian regime systematically refuses the Ah@@ ra@@ zi Arab@@ ians to work in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government also built a large number of dam@@ s that diver@@ t water from the Arab areas into the Persian territories , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m lie .
these dam@@ s have only led to deteri@@ or@@ ating the devast@@ ation caused in the region by dr@@ y@@ ness , and destroying local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ Fis@@ her@@ men rose to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohamed P@@ ur , the Director General of Iran for co@@ operatives , work and social welfare , reported that 5 % of Ah@@ ra@@ z@@ is , who are looking for a job , completed primary school , completed 55 % of secondary school and 45 % have a university degree .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; systematic strategy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ hi@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Sus@@ wa@@ zi human rights activ@@ ist resident in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; led to a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of suicide among young Ah@@ ra@@ zi .
the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans coming from Ah@@ ra@@ z and anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recruitment process :
since officials and institutions pre@@ fers not recru@@ iting Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi is deprived of access to work opportunities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance to young Arabs and forcing them to earn their livel@@ ihood outside their home country of Ah@@ ra@@ z .
there are people who had to change their first and last names to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ ra@@ zi , and so be hired , since even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated , let alone the pron@@ unciation of the Arabic language or the wearing of Arab clothing .
given the circumstances that the Ah@@ ra@@ zi had to endure , human rights activists attack alarm before the situation is explosive .
it remains to be seen whether the world is w@@ aking up and knowing it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why I don &apos;t identify with femin@@ ism , neither with inter @-@ sec@@ tional &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and was originally published on A@@ fro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as website . the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed .
they can be read in the comments under the original text .
when I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , many women - especially white women , who call themselves inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - react with fru@@ stration .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put well thought out scientific and soci@@ etal arguments before me , why I should be femin@@ ist and why we should be all fem@@ inists in general .
for example , despite equal education , women still earn less money than men .
that women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women encounter a glass ceiling in various areas of life sooner or later , and that discrimination based on sex is still moving across the many different countries and beliefs .
all of this is aware and known to me .
I am convinced and I suffer twice and thre@@ ef@@ old under it .
I am a black woman .
and yet , when I come to skin colour , on rac@@ ism , on black women women , on black women in the LGB@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; when I mention how we have always been ab@@ used physically , mentally and verb@@ ally , both in and out of the femin@@ ist movement , many white fem@@ inists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists decided to remain silent .
however , all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; lift up their voices and sing &quot; Kum@@ ba@@ ya , my Lord &quot; to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women .
but they do not want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexu@@ alised violence , there is a institution@@ alised form of ra@@ cial @-@ motivated violence , which we are faced with black women in tw@@ o@@ fold manner .
or that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and places of origin earn less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to the school as white girls due to obvious integration problems .
or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk to suffer domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women .
on the one hand , I want all women , all men , and all men of any skin color have the same rights ; on the other hand , I cannot join a movement in whose centre the white woman stands who refuses to take into account un@@ fair@@ ness in her thinking , which relate to the sex as well as the skin color of a person .
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my belonging to a white @-@ femin@@ ist sphere that has rejected me and countless other black women over and over again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 51 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I too refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a men@@ ial and margin@@ alised creature in historical terms . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I refuse to join groups that also absorb our customs and customs through cultural appropri@@ ation to promote their eg@@ oc@@ entri@@ c program .
I will no longer try to explain white women the importance of over@@ lap of skin color and gender . for some of them continue to mention the importance of black women for the femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to teach them a better .
although inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give a home to women of different origins and isol@@ ate themselves from white femin@@ ism , there is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in its name .
I prefer to dissolve myself completely from femin@@ ism and to join the Movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which was called to life for my dark skin and my status as a woman , rather than advoc@@ ating for a white @-@ femin@@ ist paradigm that is so stub@@ born that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a new phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever that black women define us according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us .
Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book &quot; Afri@@ cana &quot; anism : &quot; claims &quot; ( e.g. : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : as we rec@@ ap@@ ture ourselves ) speaks of defending ourselves in our own way . and not only that - black women can in this way create spaces where they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural , mental , psychological , physical and even spiritual elements can be worshipped , which make up the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists will immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of femin@@ ist movement by which the black woman is affected .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment I can lift up black women and women of other cultures , for in this paradigm I exist .
I am recognized as a part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and my being as a woman .
I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment where my life is neither ignored nor ignored , nor rejected .
p@@ add@@ ling against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
this contribution by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that focuses on international efforts to solve environmental problems .
as part of a content sharing agreement , this article will be published again .
again and again Nab@@ il Mus@@ a traveled in the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or can@@ oe - with a special concern of the Kur@@ dist@@ an region in Iraq . his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations .
in this documentary by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really wanted to do something for the river we had lost when I was still a child , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mus@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development , will lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organization Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Iraq - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance , who is committed to protecting the rivers , streams and water routes in Iraq , as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video Mus@@ a summari@@ zes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was produced , filmed and edited by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , a documentary film@@ maker and multimedia journalist based in Er@@ bil in Iraq .
the focus of their work lies on persecuted , little resp@@ ectable sub @-@ cultures , and is characterized by the use of cooperative vide@@ ography and new multimedia techniques , with their help repres@@ sed communities that can tell their stories in their own way .
Paragu@@ ays women and their tough@@ er fight against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; a group of women portra@@ ys &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crying women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to express their pain of the murder of women in the country and in the region and to show their rejection . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated and edited version of the article &quot; The Wave of Viol@@ ence Against Women in Paraguay &quot; by Elec@@ tural . the article is part of the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # wei@@ ght@@ ein@@ ef@@ rau@@ bin ) reporting about the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the affected people .
a police commission@@ er told A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ partner who had become violent .
since the end of their relationship , some time has passed and the police said their statement would be put to the files , but more could not be done .
when another woman showed Bal@@ bu@@ ena due to mal@@ treatment , the informed indication of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez also took advantage of nothing .
a few days later the second woman returned her ad .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
if women report a complaint at all , they generally do not receive any support from the State .
in many cases , women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women , who admit to be victims of violence , are at all reporting to the law enforcement authorities .
In@@ halt@@ 1 Stri@@ kes and Statistics 2 In@@ visible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a legal system that does not under@@ line Paraguay &apos;s laws : good approach , faulty implementation impacts and statistics
it is difficult to determine how many women are really ab@@ used , &quot; says Mi@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aci@@ ón y E@@ studios , a social science research institute in Paraguay . &quot; there are several indications and reports , but they do not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; she explains .
the available numbers , however , are alar@@ ming .
in 2015 , 9@@ 600 ads of domestic violence began at the District At@@ tor@@ ney &apos;s Office . 70 % of these were violence against women .
86 % of the police came from women .
there were more than 5,000 adver@@ ts due to domestic violence in the courts of peace . here again , 86 % of the ads came from women .
in the ads , 40 % of women reported that they were physically ab@@ used , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse .
these statistics , however , do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an women minister Ana Bai@@ ardi , only a few of these crimes are actually shown . &quot; to any woman who has been notified in Paraguay for psychological abuse , 9 women who do not do so .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for every woman ref@@ unded for bodily abuse , two women who do not do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she declared at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because women &apos;s murder is not a criminal off@@ ence in Paraguay , law enforcement agencies cannot adequately document how many women are murdered by their current or former partners each year .
by August 2016 alone , journalists counted at least 12 cases of suicide in the country .
the coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , in Paraguay , every ten days a woman died because of violent acts by men .

invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a judicial system that does not decline
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z became the fi@@ ery friend of Carlos Vera , he insist@@ ed that she called him the names of all her former friends .
in the beginning she didn &apos;t want to do that , but then she gave up . this should be regre@@ t@@ ted forever .
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos . but for two years she endu@@ red psych@@ ic violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most severe recognizable :
I never thought I would be victims of abuse .
when I read about it earlier , I always thought that only women who are too sub@@ mis@@ sive because they are deceived by violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report on the abuse by Carlos Vera .
without nam@@ ing names , she wrote posts on Facebook where she described his insul@@ ts and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had insul@@ ted them .
many people responded to their posts , including Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically , if he ever lifted the hand against them and refused to admit that his behavior was also a form of abuse .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she had fallen by Carlos for so long and did not leave him earlier .
it seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse would at least have a certain complic@@ ity in it .
Victoria San@@ tos , who does not come from Paraguay , fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner was ab@@ using her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Victoria is a member of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ o te Cre@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; network ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) consisting of women who are all victims of abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the group , they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the testim@@ onies of women seriously .
in Victoria &apos;s case , everything started with psychological abuse .
her aff@@ lu@@ ent partner even managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat her .
Victoria &apos;s advertisements with the authorities stayed without a result and also from their relatives , it received no support .
she conducted a trial against her former partner who developed into an un@@ man@@ a@@ geable j@@ uri@@ di@@ cal struggle between Paraguay and her home country , primarily for money , power and the influence of her former partner .
Paragu@@ ays La@@ ws : good approach , poor implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good , but not applied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the announcement of abuse is a way of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a bill was discussed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an parliament , which was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ ell@@ as ( # Du@@ el@@ as ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os movement are part of a campaign on Twitter supported by Am@@ ne@@ sty International .
the original draft of the law stipul@@ ates that fem@@ in@@ ism is to be explained and pun@@ ish@@ able by a perpet@@ ual off@@ ence , as is the case in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
so the bill was changed in some points to also win the de@@ pu@@ ties for the law which feared that the path to de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions would be denied , which is currently banned in Paraguay , and will be punished with up to five years imprisonment .
the original bill had fores@@ een that most of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) proced@@ ural costs which the victims of violence must present themselves , if they just want to refund and receive a secure accommodation , to impose the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient financial means for it :
in Paraguay , mal@@ treatment is seen as a part of inter@@ personal relationships .
here , a re@@ think must take place so that violence is no longer regarded as something normal .
whoever is silent in the face of these facts , complic@@ ates himself and contributes to the fact that the offen@@ ders get away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to report as long as mis@@ handling does not apply any more than normal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 10 November 2016 , the law was passed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . however , parts of the law had been changed before , among other things , a passage that the partners called up for reconciliation in cases of domestic violence .
opinions on the changes take place .
the section on reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
the cancellation of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political force &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law , however , is considered a great set@@ back .
this article is the abbrevi@@ ated and edited version of the article &quot; The Wave of Viol@@ ence Against Women in Paraguay &quot; by Elec@@ tural . the article is part of the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # wei@@ ght@@ ein@@ ef@@ rau@@ bin ) reporting about the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the affected people .
independent media continues to attack Oman one year after a newspaper ban
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was blocked due to a resolution of the Minister of Information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is read on the homepage of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a year ago , the Ottom@@ an authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ language journal Az@@ am@@ n because of their coverage of corruption in the sul@@ tan .
You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to be in prison where he is serving a one year prison sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and brought to trial , but later released .
Oman has been governed since 1970 by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid , who came to power after he had dismissed his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
since then , in addition to his role as the only sul@@ tan , he has held the most important positions in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Minister of Finance , Foreign Affairs , Chairman of the Supreme Council for the planning and President of the Central Bank .
the Sultan &apos;s rule is characterised by the insist@@ ent efforts of security forces , especially domestic intelligence , public liber@@ ties , including freedom of the press , restric@@ ting and incar@@ n@@ ating human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists .
the authorities are systematically restric@@ ting peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights , also campaig@@ ners to freely express their views on the public affairs of the country such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline .
the attack on Az@@ am@@ n newspaper , their closing and detention of three of their editors last year is a hard blow to the freedom of the press in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper , which has been reported since its inc@@ eption in 2007 on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , announced that an article entitled &quot; High @-@ ranking Parties bind the hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary &quot; was published in the newspaper on July 26 , 2016 .
in the report , government officials were accused of having pressur@@ ised judges of the Supreme Court in Oman to make a judgment in a her@@ edi@@ tary dispute .

on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , a member of the editorial board , was invited to the Special Department at ISS and arrested by the security forces upon his arrival .
on 9 August 2016 , ISS admitted the deputy editor @-@ in @-@ chief You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who had acted as editor @-@ in @-@ chief after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper was closed in@@ definitely after the Minister of Information had given the directive that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the publication and dis@@ semination of the newspaper is prohibited on any path , including online , from 9 August 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the first trial in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i was held before the Court in Mas@@ k@@ at .
the Court sentenced the three journalists to prison sentences and ordered the final closure of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both condemned , inter alia , to distur@@ b public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining the Pres@@ ent of the State . &quot;
in addition , Al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of the violation of a ban on publication and the slan@@ der .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years imprisonment and fin@@ es in the amount of 3,000 Yuan ( $ 7@@ 800 ) . in addition , a year @-@ old prohibition of employment was imposed on the two journalists .
al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of using &quot; an information network to spread material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
for Al @-@ Abr@@ i , a security deposit amounting to $ 5000 was fixed ( $ 13@@ ,000 ) and was released on 22 August 2016 before the pron@@ ounc@@ ement of the sentence .
the Appe@@ als Court acqu@@ itted Al @-@ Abr@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to six months in prison for a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after his six @-@ month prison sentence from the Central prison in Mas@@ k@@ at . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison where he served his one year sentence .
the Appe@@ als Court also highlighted the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper .
despite the decision of the Court to leave Az@@ am@@ n again , the newspaper continues to face attacks by the government of the Congo .
on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued an order with which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed another order in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , and with which the minister announced another time against the decision of the Appe@@ als Court to re@@ introduce the publication of the newspaper .
the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper aren &apos;t the only cases in which the freedom of the press was viol@@ ated recently in Oman .
further injuries include , for example , the closure of the site of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to cease its operation .
due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the imprisonment of the journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression arises that the om@@ echan@@ ical authorities are still not ready to put an end to the extensive violation of the freedom of the press .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls on the authorities to :
1 . to release You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condi@@ tionally ;
2. to create a safe environment for the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper , so that their journalists can follow their work ;
3. protecting the freedom of the press in the country and
4 . in all circumstances to ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman can exercise their legitimate human rights work un@@ hin@@ dered and without fear of ret@@ ali@@ ation measures , including judicial ch@@ ic@@ anes .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization that supports human rights advoc@@ ates ( including independent journalists , blo@@ ggers , lawyers etc . ) in the Gulf region and in neighbouring countries by promoting the freedom of expression and association and the right to peac@@ efully assemble , support and provide protection .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , picture takes place with his consent
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or even mentioned in the media . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out on @-@ site : on the one hand , many medicines and vacc@@ ines are missing in the supply of global health care , which cover the special medical need on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria have far more severe consequences in Africa &apos;s poor@@ est countries than elsewhere , and lack of investment in research on these diseases caused by pharmaceutical companies is a major problem .
secondly , research carried out by African researchers helps build up their own research capacities in Africa . a major role of science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is the director of the Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , CI@@ DR@@ Z ) .
he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia in the 1990s , just when the AIDS epide@@ mic revealed first serious re@@ perc@@ ussions for national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana .
as post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself resear@@ ched the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the sam@@ bic health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research .
( disc@@ laim@@ er : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ ren RW : at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ bic national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition , I am currently launching a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens .
GV : what are the most important current scientific topics in your country and Africa in general ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions developed elsewhere .
this has to change , otherwise we will always be recipients instead of being a creator himself .
the solutions we get are often not well usable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here .
GV : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are funded in different ways .
it is difficult to find people who want to come back or go here because the financing and development chances are better in other countries .
GV : what is the research infrastructure ?
what are the obstacles in your routine research work that you did not have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries .
GV : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there is already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
GV : how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it concentrate and how can we support the development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is need for special scientific training , starting at any age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , space exploration , health care ( non @-@ communic@@ able and infectious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly .
GV : can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa in comparison to Western countries , based on your experience ?
RW : often , it is the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that challenges here .
the system that journals contain articles only against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research .
from the USA to India : how &quot; Open Source &quot; seed producers change global food production
this article by Rachel C@@ ern@@ in@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mor@@ ton has been breeding in the USA since the 1980s .
his company offers 114 grades such as Out@@ red@@ dens , the first plant grown and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space .
for almost 20 years , Mor@@ ton &apos;s work was limited only by his own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question of how many sorts of let@@ tu@@ ce he can get .
but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use them further for breeding .
patents applied not only for individual varieties , but also for certain properties such as resistance to disease , a special red or green tone or cur@@ led leaves .
over the past few years , more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as grain or cart@@ ons . due to this trend , plant bree@@ ders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts provide food security for the future of food production .
Mor@@ ton continues to grow salads as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia @-@ old tradition , but it takes longer , since his work is more and more difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is as if in a river there are a b@@ oul@@ der that I have to p@@ addle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have to do it now , but it &apos;s a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think these patents go too far . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if they stand in court , no one can breed a new type of salad , because all the characteristics are already patented . &quot; thus , he continues to do as good as possible and tries to extract the characteristics he wants .
however , it is very cau@@ tious and endeav@@ ours not to use any material protected as intellectual property .
he also joined a movement that is becoming ever greater in the United States and all over the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; re@@ ins ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and ate red Rö@@ mer@@ let@@ at of the variety Out@@ skir@@ ts in the &quot; glas@@ sh@@ ouse &quot; of the station , where it is tested whether plants can be grown in space .

it is no coinci@@ dence that this name sounds as if the movement from the IT field would come from and not from the field of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( Initiative for Open Source &quot; seed ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software , which provides alternatives to copy@@ righ@@ ted software .
it was called into life to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and can be used permanently for plant bree@@ ders .
in the context of the initiative , in short O@@ ss@@ i , US bree@@ ders can commit to freely use the seeds bred by them .
however , this does not mean that they cannot continue to do business with their seed and sell it . &quot; open Source &quot; bree@@ ders only allow others who buy their seeds to breed their own varieties , and do not immediately cut out - two aspects that are forbidden or prescribed by many plant patents .
dozens of bree@@ ders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy prospects
for the Emer@@ itus Professor at University of Wisconsin @-@ Ma@@ dison and O@@ ss@@ i board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control of seeds and the opportunity to grow new plants are important for food security and environmental protection .
according to him , seed plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity , farmers &apos; rights , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bree@@ ders would try to exploit the latter not or only little by breeding seed with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg points out that the &quot; Open Source &quot; movement does not concern itself with genetically modified plants .
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , genetically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over the seed , &quot; he says and takes stock of the increasingly common mer@@ gers in the global agriculture industry , as it is offered in August and September 2016 . &quot; if you want to buy good , locally and sustain@@ ably produced vegetables , as it is offered on farmers markets , you should also know that the way in which this vegetable is grown is threatened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; food sovereignty without the sovereignty of seeds is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to ensuring that their seed continues to be freely available to others , in contrast to patented seed and plant features .
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is endangered as the available gene pool is constantly shr@@ inking due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights available on plant material , which is therefore increasingly limited .
Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of the O@@ ss@@ i , has worked in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found out that about one third of all card features are protected as intellectual property , making it impossible for plant bree@@ ders to be used either at all or at all .
there are still no such estimates for other plants , but experts like Lu@@ by suggest that vast cultivated plants such as wheat are patented in an even greater style than salad or car@@ rots .
a question of view
plants are bred in such a way that they have targeted characteristics - from those , through which their taste or colour improves up to such , because of which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
ad@@ versaries of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for bree@@ ders is decreasing by more and more patents . however , genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the changed conditions are much less predictable due to climate change .
in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to spokesperson Car@@ ly S@@ ca@@ du@@ to recognis@@ es that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the United States Ministry of Agriculture , the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity .
however , it contradic@@ ts the notion that intellectual property restric@@ ts other bree@@ ders as &quot; patents and the protection of plant diversity promote innovation . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent exp@@ ires .
often these instructions help others to come to the same result with another method .
such protection does not inhi@@ bit innovation , but encourages them by providing more material and expertise to the public . &quot;
Mor@@ ton sees it differently : 20 years waiting until a patent exp@@ ires , certainly does not promote innovation .
and if you have to wait so long to breed plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions , you would have already lost the fight .
however , the main argument for Mor@@ ton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant bree@@ ders have neither the time nor money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us .
we want farmers to make their work easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us , and it is impossible for us to continue using the best and newest genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in all , Mor@@ ton interfer@@ es with the concept of patented plant tra@@ its : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not really create the tra@@ its themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plants form them themselves and as bree@@ ders we finally have no idea how the plants do that .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for Caro@@ l Dep@@ pe , plant bree@@ der in the US state of Oregon and O@@ ss@@ i board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; whoever breeds a variety , also breeding his own values into it .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures will be required to produce massive her@@ bi@@ cides for their cultivation , who cul@@ min@@ ates in its varieties of this concept of agriculture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is exactly opposite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( those who move on international markets , but smaller than e.g. Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents , do most of the smaller seed companies to survive without patents - either they reject patents or they keep it too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both are the case .
the independent plant bree@@ der Frank Mor@@ ton is looking for salads at his breeding garden .

Mor@@ ton is also convinced that bree@@ ders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents : &quot; it looks like I &apos;m getting stronger than firms with my efforts to produce something new .
I constantly need new material for my catalogue , since I know that my competitors will sell my grades in a few years , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent it is protected for 20 years from competition , with which one makes it quite easy in my opinion . &quot; worldwide resonance
although the USA seems to be leading in the &quot; open source &quot; breeding , the concept is now spreading rapidly throughout the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , is working together with farmers and helps them grow new varieties that meet certain requirements .
it also supports them to come to &quot; open source &quot; seeds and sell their own .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German organization Agre@@ col works on an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; license which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of O@@ ss@@ i obligation for bree@@ ders in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( regulations for breeding vary from country to country , therefore the O@@ ss@@ i obligation cannot be easily adopted one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . thus , it speaks against the current practice of the European Patent Office , which allows for patents on conven@@ tionally cultivated plants .
one explanation , however , is not a law ; now it is up to the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line .
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa came together to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards the pat@@ enting of seeds .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos;s &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems , explains that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems for which scheduled next year will be the official starting signal .
a consortium of environmental and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit aid organization US@@ C Canada and the Action Group on erosion , technology and concentration ) has compiled a database on seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the global alliance for the future of food , has published a report to support organizations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others . it believes farmers have the opportunity to come to seed , exchange and improve the seed policy so that a stable supply of food can be ensured .
the report also highlights the importance of a diverse , local supply of seed for sustainable food systems - a context that Lu@@ by von O@@ ss@@ i hopes that more people will soon see him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has particularly taken care of where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role in doing so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now trying to make people clear that there is even more behind their foods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organization and blog are the newest aims of cens@@ orship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities still block content on the Internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekend of 5 August , the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents violations of human rights in Egypt and the Arab world and reported about it .
in August , the network published an opinion on Facebook , in which it sharply critici@@ zed the Egyptian authorities for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region .
the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information has remained true to its goal in defending freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world , in order to defend freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world , so it has never been as important as now . AN@@ HR@@ I confirms that all technical possibilities are exhausted to overcome the barriers and not give in . we ins@@ ist on carrying out our task .
AN@@ HR@@ I is considered to be the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organization in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 sites more than two months ago , such as the Independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arabic @-@ speaking issue of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Qatar @-@ based Al J@@ az@@ e@@ era network for alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of the wave of sei@@ s@@ mic barriers to the victim . @ an@@ hr@@ i is one of the main sources of human rights in Arab language ht@@ t@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ P@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
besides AN@@ HR@@ I , the blog of the colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher Ah@@ med Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada has no access to Egypt anymore .
Zi@@ ada took advantage of his blog for the spread of columns and articles that he wrote in Egypt not accessible websites and media .
now the blog he set up to circum@@ vent the cens@@ orship of the Egyptian government , even the target of an attack .
blo@@ gger , the provider with whom also the blog &apos;s blog is located , is more accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , reporting about the student protests and recorded a video of how the police exercised physical violence against two students .
his articles are mainly about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada expressed himself in blocking the government and reflected what this meant for him :
the blo@@ gs to lock is very old , but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ tah al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even if blocking the blo@@ gs may not be significant for the world , it is for two reasons for me :
1 ) It succeeded in giving me the feeling of a state of siege ; arrest , attempted murder , a charge at the National Security Council , blocking blo@@ gs as well as any other website I worked for .
2 ) You have proven that I did not write in vain . in other words : my words have influence , al@@ beit only to a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first I used it to post articles to circum@@ vent the cens@@ orship .
but now , after they have locked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the brave walk the way to the end .
the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) blocked Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06 August 133 websites . this resulted in technical tests on the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one and ET@@ IS@@ A@@ LA@@ T .
af@@ te also documented the blocking of providers by switching online cens@@ orship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
af@@ te reported in her research :
on Monday , June 12 we noticed how the blocking of web pages that V@@ P@@ N@@ s offer began .
such a practice points to the government &apos;s intention to further block and filter content on which Egyptian users could have access .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the situation is additionally wor@@ sen@@ ed by the fact that the cens@@ orship decisions are made behind closed doors , which means that the Egyptian population does not have a legal basis to act against these acts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the cens@@ orship and whom will it attack next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants argue .
the Brazilian army was deployed in the F@@ av@@ el@@ as in Nit@@ er@@ ó@@ i , a city in the state of Rio de Janeiro , during the government crisis .

day after day newspapers in Brazil are reporting dark head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motifs .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot in school , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every second day a police officer is murdered in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Thi@@ eves smo@@ kes pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , nav@@ y and air sea to Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the wave of violence in Rio achieved its highest level for 10 years .
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organisation Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become everyday and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; at least you will find the manager of a local newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the editorial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; known for the detailed reporting of violence in Rio on 16 August , published the editorial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is not normal &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which she announced to set up a new section called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now published there .
the newspaper explained the motives for their decision :
extra will continue to report about crimes that happen in every major city in the world such as murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sex crimes , etc . everything , however , devi@@ ates from the civili@@ zed standard and what happens only in Rio is published in the category &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four @-@ minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper , declared that this decision was not a cause for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
it is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war ru@@ bri@@ c in a country that does not recognize the war .
in the same video , a journalist from the newspaper explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 8@@ 43 areas controlled by criminal organizations .
in the editorial , the newspaper writes :
we are aware that a war discourse , if it is distorted , can also be used to cover the atro@@ cities of the police that only shoots and then asks questions .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose goal is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the Ma@@ fia and its partners .
does the term &quot; war &quot; harm more than it uses ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , the journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira argued against violence as a &quot; war . &quot; this was in their opinion a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to hold responsible for the police .
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and bad planning - as demonstrated by the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel , education and a historical and compl@@ ac@@ ent negl@@ ect of public service .
in memory , Rio de Janeiro State is bigger than its capital .

call Rio de Janeiro as &quot; the most violent place in Brazil , &quot; according to Cec@@ í@@ lia is wrong : &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to the statistics of 2015 in the north and northeast of the country .
none of these cities are located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
when we look at the Mor@@ dr@@ ates per State , Rio is ranked 16 , &quot; she writes .
in addition , Glob@@ o is one of South America &apos;s largest media enterprise , which , as Cec@@ í@@ lia emphas@@ ises , has been repe@@ ating the state &apos;s security policy for years .
these security policy measures included the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia Paci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit deployed in Rio in 2003 , whose goal is to capture a F@@ av@@ ela by deplo@@ ying a massive police station and permanently station@@ ing a unit there .
in the beginning , the U@@ PP was increasingly under fire after several reports of har@@ ass@@ ment and repression against the poor communities , which should actually protect the newly created police unit .
on his Facebook page , journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux was quoted from one of his articles in 2010 , explaining why the violence in Rio does not correspond to the criteria defined by the Geneva Con@@ ventions for the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also ent@@ ails serious consequences for people .
this requires the state to use resources and ways that are typical of a war . this includes penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; where a civilian is an un@@ as@@ sail@@ able point in the landscape and becomes an object for &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; and &quot; lost balls . &quot;
the fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ ela in Rio continue to suffer .
it is now a week that the police cl@@ apped the mountain with the fav@@ ela Jac@@ ar@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
in the midst of all this violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : an or@@ ch@@ ard died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter .

to stay alive : learn besieg@@ ed Syrians , plant mushrooms
screen@@ shot from the advertising video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ Action
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the following civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime against loyal troops .
according to victory Watch , a joint initiative of the peace organization PA@@ X and the research institute The Syria Institute , there are currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege in Damascus and surrounding , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ li@@ b .
the region of Eastern Gh@@ out@@ a , where an attack with chemical weapons on August 21 , 2013 demanded the life of hundreds of civilians .
many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition are assuming that the massacre of the Assad regime was perpet@@ rated by the United Nations and other human rights organisations .
since 2013 , these rebel controlled areas outside Damascus have been under siege , leading to the need for local residents to be purchased locally or by tunnels and control points .
due to the years of block@@ ade , traditional food like meat has become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population .
as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian workers and ac@@ adem@@ ics teach the inhabitants of Eastern Gh@@ out@@ as how they can plant their own mushrooms as &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms do not belong to the traditional food produced in Syria and are very rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their nutritional quality makes them an attractive source of food for many residents of the besieg@@ ed Eastern Gh@@ out@@ a .
the direct of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to AF@@ P , the French news agency :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we chose to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dr. Ah@@ med Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices , who has been fighting for three years to make this project known and expressed his relief that it is becoming more and more known . &quot;
to collect money for the initiative , we use the humanitarian Crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da .
it is planned to give 125 families knowledge of planting mushrooms , so Dr. Lei@@ la to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of around 12,@@ 700 euros , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ Do until Monday , 04 September 2017 .
the initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
due to the shortage of fuel , locally produced plastic fuels are used to supply the generators with the necessary energy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices that they began with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; production of fung@@ al seeds origin@@ ating from regions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then they planted a small mushroom farm in a tub . when this succeeded , they used a bigger tub . and so on .
now they have designed a &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed fung@@ i throughout Eastern Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge .
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach humans the mushroom breeding for various reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : breaking up the siege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
provision of a new food source in the market .
dis@@ semin@@ ating a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food lef@@ to@@ vers ( like paper , tea , coffee , cardboard , etc ) for the extraction of new foods .
creation of new jobs , especially for women working at home .
creating new jobs for people with disabilities who are bound to their homes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea around the world , so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and siege are visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experience to inspire people in crisis regions and we can help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese call for justice for the victims of the fires of 2017
several hundred people prot@@ ested on 21 October in many provincial capitals in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of fires that were r@@ amp@@ ant in the north of Portugal in the week before .
forty @-@ two persons died and about 70 were injured as a result of the fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
fires were also registered in the Gali@@ cia region in Spain where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire @-@ break@@ ers spreading in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , a similar tragedy occurred in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 wounded .
according to the European forest monitoring system , which monitors the forest areas via satellite images , about 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district .
so that you can get a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .

the Rem@@ edi@@ ble Trage@@ dy
the goal of the protests of Saturday was the demand for better preventive and fire fighting measures by the state .
people wonder@@ ed why civil protection was not able to cur@@ b the scale of the tragedy as far as possible .
Jo@@ ão So@@ ver@@ al from the Federation of the Far@@ mers of Portugal explained the newspaper P@@ ú@@ bli@@ co :
after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão roads and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did not do this anywhere else : there are dozens of open roads surrounded by fire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy like in June could have happened again , as the streets were closed very late . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , building permits are questioned in places with a high risk of fire .
a far @-@ reaching proposal for the reform of the forest , which the government had brought after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ected by the local authorities who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment .
&quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law , which allowed construction activity in case the applicant had funds for self @-@ defence - that was an open back door so that everything could be built , &quot; continues Jo@@ ão Sor@@ val in the same article of the P@@ ú@@ bli@@ co newspaper .
the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees made of slightly combus@@ tible wood , like in a vi@@ cious circle , continue to spread to fires of this kind .
to these problems , the website of Civil Defence of Portugal on 15 and 16 October , when inhabitants requested information or attempted to contact relatives , was offline .
it was a private initiative that provided information to the population : they used their own civil protection data using the application f@@ og@@ os.@@ ge and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ ão P@@ ina in order to simplify the work of the fire bri@@ g@@ ade and was so crucial at this fat@@ eful weekend in October that the servers did not stop the ons@@ lau@@ ght of the 400@@ ,000 users who followed fires : the website counted more than half a million hits .

in one night in the autumn of 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Tali@@ ban .
two years earlier , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n groups that had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . so Afghanistan became a country of terror and despair .
exactly at that time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati sat , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in G@@ haz@@ ni Province in central Afghanistan last time with his family at dinner .
even though his mother did not say so , she knew she would not see her son for a long time - maybe even more .
in the morning , the boy was supposed to break .
his unc@@ le would pick him up and bring him to the tu@@ gs .

Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ le party , dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been murdered by the Tali@@ ban and many of the Haz@@ ara suddenly felt def@@ en@@ sel@@ ess .
the Tali@@ ban , known for their hate , came closer and closer .
many of Haz@@ ara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found himself back in Pakistan .
for a few years he worked in a co@@ h@@ ort . the work was heavy and made him sick .
then he took what was left of his low wage , and went to Iran . once again he found himself in a foreign country along with other refugees and drag@@ ged sacks with mortar which were heavier than himself in order to earn his living .
back then , as today , the life of Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran was characterized by misery and exploitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was really hard , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said A@@ shar@@ af in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site on which we also worked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no service there and no heating . we hung nylon in front of the open windows , so that we did not freeze at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ af had left his life without papers in Iran and made himself ready for the trip to Europe .
during the dangerous crossing of the sea he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and landed on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities refused asylum , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 .
some time A@@ shar@@ af was hom@@ eless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to the needy two times a day .
it is true that because of relatively high twin @-@ quot@@ as , Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seek@@ ers . however , it is also true that the conditions that asylum seek@@ ers find in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the vast majority of asylum seek@@ ers are accommod@@ ated in the more than 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special reception centres &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; these are impro@@ vised bodies in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be assigned to an admission centre if they have officially submitted an application for asylum - which can still go for months after the filing of the asylum application .
until then , people who don &apos;t have money for accommodation depend on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
so it was also A@@ shar@@ af .
but his unconditional lifetime helped A@@ shar@@ af to get rid of these conditions soon .
after having made various works in the construction industry for several years , A@@ shar@@ af put all his savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice .
this went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast @-@ snack bar .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis &apos;s success story is now the topic of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) by director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
the film won the Venice City Award 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just a few of the obstacles .
according to un@@ official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries .
in recent years some Afgh@@ ans run companies , including tail@@ ors , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were praised even in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his Restaurant Orient Experience in which the wa@@ iters and kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy by the different Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts .
the Afgh@@ an entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari in Pa@@ dua opened the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizz@@ eria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a sus@@ hi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
but A@@ shar@@ k &apos;s goals go far beyond the Italian gastronomic industry and retail , and aim back to the country , which he had to leave as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; where there is a risk , there are also opportunities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan .
I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily if I know that my people are suffering .
I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as everyone else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af also for@@ ges plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and preservation techniques . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they can sell their crop sur@@ pl@@ uses on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the development of a successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end stability and prosperity .
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey himself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this journey .

should the law be passed , this may mean up to three years &quot; imprisonment for the convic@@ ted .
in addition , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger for many years .
a striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he photograph@@ ed Egyptian police while demonstrating violence against demonstr@@ ators who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the removal of the elected president Mohamed Mor@@ si .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sha@@ w@@ ri@@ kan waited , as more than 700 protest participants were arrested for the same incident four years in jail for a court date . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed to the 20th of May , because the prison administration , according to human rights groups , failed to bring the def@@ end@@ ant from prison to the cour@@ t@@ room .
Sha@@ w@@ kan faces the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree , including ce@@ ase@@ fire , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder .
in another case , a criminal court in G@@ iz@@ a released the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were indic@@ ted for their reporting on the pro @-@ Mor@@ si seat block@@ ade on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo .
the court also reduced the sentences of the journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa , and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested at the previous incident , from 25 years to 5 years .
Tunisi@@ an activ@@ ist inter@@ ro@@ gated to le@@ aked documents
in May Tunisi@@ an authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ ro@@ gation of Sam@@ i Ben @-@ G@@ har@@ ah , who is co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy Project .
Ben @-@ G@@ har@@ ah was chi@@ ef@@ ly inter@@ ro@@ gated to a more experienced plan of action . said plan was provided by the President of the Republic , who explicitly supports business people and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption , provided they return all un@@ lawful funds .
the document published on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at on April 21 th@@ rows a light on how the presidential plans look to the support of the legislation .
Ben @-@ G@@ har@@ ah rejected the nam@@ ing of his sources by speci@@ fying Article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an Press Code , which journalists access right to protection of their sources .
nevertheless , he appeared as a witness in the Tunis District Court on May 9th .
will China force the users of social media to submit their ID ?
according to new regulations by the Office of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China require a permit before they write or share news in social media .
it is also stated in the rules that registration will be necessary with the full real name .
analysts assume that this will allow the elimination of anonymous comments in conversations within social networks . up to now it is unclear how the authorities will apply these regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chinese citizens have proposed social media to sel@@ ectively en@@ force these rules in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and its independence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do we see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
may the state cens@@ orship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese Mess@@ aging App We@@ Chat .
according to Ros@@ kom@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat refused to register with the state government as an &quot; organis@@ er of information distribution . &quot;
this designation is part of a 2014 law , thanks to which the Russian government provides a list of online services that organize the &quot; publication of information . &quot; the law also allows the government to make ob@@ s@@ essed services responsible for the removal of content and to force it on request to susp@@ end user data .
websites such as V@@ kontakte and Od@@ no@@ stand@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the e @-@ mail service mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services .
Turkish court has ban on Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
a Turkish court ordered Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English @-@ language articles , the declar@@ ations that Turkey supports the jihadi@@ sts in Syria .
the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communications said that the site was blocked because it became &quot; a source of information that co@@ operates with groups to fom@@ ent a political de@@ fam@@ ation campaign against Turkey . &quot;
it is the first time Turkey has blocked the website completely . it is thus , besides China , one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible .
great Britain cannot stop sn@@ u@@ ff@@ ing
after this week , the UK government is in the midst of a deliber@@ ate consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and to install Backdoor programs that dec@@ r@@ yp@@ t data encryption .
the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and secret services regarding the proposal , but has left other technology companies and the civilian population on the outside .
despite all this , the consultation still runs until May 19 . reactions and proposals by members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior .

we , the members of the Chinese LGB@@ T@@ Q community , are side by side with victims of the tragedy and their families and loved ones and with all members of the worldwide LGB@@ T@@ Q community .
we mo@@ urn together with them about the loss of so many innocent lives and condemn terrorism as well as all other forms of violence committed to men due to their sexu@@ ality , gender identity and expression of sex . in China , violence against sexu@@ ality , gender identity and expression of sex occurs every day , for example through bul@@ lying of LGB@@ T@@ Q teenagers in schools , generally discrimin@@ atory treatment and in the application of therapies aimed at &quot; healing &quot; gay and bis@@ exual people .
Blu@@ ed , China &apos;s most popular dating app for homosexu@@ als , changed its charge screen , which now displays the &quot; we stand with Orlando &quot; words ( such as : page to page with Orlando ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the LGB@@ T community is part of the great family of humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will win this war through love , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the founder of Blu@@ ed on his turn@@ out account . &quot; &quot; &quot;
dozens of people gathered in Hong Kong on Monday evening to commemor@@ ate the assass@@ ination attempt .
XI J@@ in@@ ping , President of China , addressed his sympathy by telephone on Monday .
