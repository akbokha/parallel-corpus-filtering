<seg id="1">Although I had visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year, I would live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation, I grew up with American movies, danced to American music, read American authors and run his sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly journalist because of an American film.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington playing the Gray Grantham in The Pelican Letter, a fearless journalist who, with the help of Julia Roberts, uncovered the murderous conspiracy of an oil magnate who wanted to occupy the top federal court with judges who were inclined to his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was trapped.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "free to Method Man," "" "I was, as if it is the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year that I lived in Arizona was only amplified by my admiration for the USA.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said: "America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had a very blackish love letter written about its size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me, how he is dealing with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never stops behind the mountain, as you say so nicely.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thinks, how a former colleague expressed it, and publicly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, African-Americans and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, the people responded to his statements and tuned in droves for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won in the Republican election was the highest number that a candidate nominated by the party ever reached.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigot person, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not reconcile Trump and his voters with the people I had met in Phoenix during my time.</seg>
<seg id="22">For example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program that embraces people from all over the world, a deeply believer person with whom I could talk about Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Trumps Weltanschauung, too, did not agree with Peter Bhatia, the current publisher of the "Cincinnati Inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps Intolerance is also in contrast to the generosity I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who fought the environment for a long time, and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">She still fits the dedication of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with much patience and grace and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise counsel helped me a lot in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values embodied by them deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump pierced his way to the nominated Republican presidential candidate, they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">It turned out however that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On November 8, 2016 more than 50 million Americans, mostly whites, gave the presidency to a man despite - or perhaps precisely because of his contempt against non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The confrontation with the idea that people voted for Trump because they either shared his racism and fanaticism or because they were willing to overlook these things, almost broke my heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to designate the Trump voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">To classify people, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and disrespectful, and implies an inability to understand those who act in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters, most of whom are white, voted for Trump because they want to regain control over a country that has disappointed them?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, would they perhaps say that they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe. maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who commentates on the cruel decision to raise a man looking down with contempt upon those who look different from him.</seg>
<seg id="41">This "Whitelash" (note, D. Ü): as much as "rebellion of the whites against all other ethnicities." word play from white in allusion to the white and whiplash, as the great Van Jones described, just killed what America has done so splendidly.</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality, it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which belief or background one may have, America is welcome everyone.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country chose as its president, twice the son of a Kenyan, whose story as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">But with the election of Donald Trumps there is a huge portion of the white America of this promise, saying: to hell with diversity, freedom of religion and the whole concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11 the white man is again at the helm, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">In all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">At a rally for Hillary Clinton Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">Donald Trump, would my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, have a place in your America? "asked Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd responded with a loud "no!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" the crowd roared.</seg>
<seg id="52">"have Latinos a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they answered." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they called and their voices became louder." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "if someone, who is not like you, would have a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a unanimous and loud "NO"!</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan concluded with the words: "thank God, Mr. Trump, this is not your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The land for whom his son fell, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is Trumps Country, said the news.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan could find no room in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that will break my heart.</seg>

<seg id="67">The "Recycled Instruments Orchestra" by Cateura, Paraguay, during a concert in Washington DC.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of Vicente Guerrero church in the province of Oaxaca together with the children of the Paraguayan city of Cateura together?</seg>
<seg id="70">That the music played in both places has not only changed the lives of children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large landfill, only 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial town which is very popular among tourists -but worlds apart from the nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world-famous kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="73">For some years now La banda de Música (music band) has played in the community: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which has found a way to overcome poverty surrounding it with their musical instruments.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become a central interest to the community of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The municipality located in one of Mexico's poorest provinces is known for its use of drugs and the use of gangs.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a coincidental encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and gave the youth a rare hope of hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI writes:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">You are always smiling and playing with gleaming eyes and playing in the bustle you can learn day by day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timpani, bongos and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from Waste</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero play the children of Cateurura - a village that is situated on the top of the biggest garbage dump of Asunción in Paraguay's capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with remanufactured instruments, consisting of local solid waste materials, produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recyclers under the direction of Favio Chávez have begun to turn parts of the waste into instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments mimic violins, violas, cellos, double bass, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion, all of which have been made from rubbish.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article from the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez, a local ecologist and musician of the children of Cateura, remembers the early days:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no room for rehearsals and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the garbage. the kids didn't know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed as Favio something he had never seen before: a violin made from waste.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today, there is a whole orchestra playing instruments of recycled material and which is called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "a documentary called" "" "Landfill Harmonic" "" "records the musical performance:" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">Every year, the world generates approximately one billion tons of trash.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and from him are the poorest - as the people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn him into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspiring spectacle of trash-to-music all around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra performed his music even before Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and teamwork can successfully fight illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that combats wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports about international, practical solutions for environmental issues.</seg>
<seg id="99">The re-release takes place as part of an agreement with Global Voices for the shared use of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa it was known then that this ship had already used illegal fishing in Liberia's waters before it sought the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were so upset and reluctant to welcome a criminal of this kind on their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comoros, Mozambique and the Seychelles quickly mobilized against the ship. they refused to buy one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing permit.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused everything," "" "Benedict Kiilu, a leading employee of the Kenyan fisheries authority, is part of a team that discovered and tracked the ship." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: he was not able to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">In the end, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, because of the plundering of the country's fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, founded in 2012 by NGO Stop Illegal Fishing (Stop Illegal fishing).</seg>
<seg id="107">In addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the members of this network are the six countries who then had driven the prime ministers from their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "" "" "we have eight countries that are like-minded and work together. they exchange information and compete with each other where it comes to illegal fishing," "" "says Tony Long, Director of the Pew Charitable Trust project Ending Illegal Fishing." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, therefore it is extremely difficult to track down. thus, illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">Due to the deliberate disregard of existing laws by which certain habitats and species are to be protected, the illegal fishing ecosystems can harm ecosystems that have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing were once hampered by bureaucratic hurdles, and even through the snail, with the information between individual countries, the actions happen nowadays in real time, traceable to FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There, for example, the individual countries can exchange listings of existing licenses, news on suspicious activities or details that one notices or experienced during a port inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i also attentively tracks the activities of ships, if they move on the open sea, via satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This makes it possible for the authorities to identify ships that fish in forbidden areas. such suspicious travel routes can also be discovered - such as those indicative that a ship loads its caught fish on the road to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such investigations show whether the participating vessels have a fishing license where they were on the way and whether they have a criminal record.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing can refuse to accept such ships in their ports on the basis of this information, which means that the ships cannot sell their cargo. and that they can even be forced to pay penalties, as in the case of the prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "then there are substantial financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is financially irrelevant." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">"" "and that's what we want to achieve," "" "says Per Erik Bergh, Managing Director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consulting firm dedicated to the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The so-called platform was created to regain an estimated $20 million in lost revenue, which the eight members of the HISH-i network will lose each year because of the illegal fishermen who enter into East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries, which is why the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="122">Their practices include actions such as sailing under false flag, counterfeit licensing, specifying fantasies, fishing of protected species and fishing in nature reserves.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "take advantage of the lack of international cooperation and take advantage of the weaknesses of a non-seamless control system," "" "says Long." "" "in the past, a ship could fish illegal and a country could say" "" "You cannot run my port." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "but another country could say" "" "Come to Me" "" "and this legal loophole tries to close FISH-i now." ""</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspicious ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has uncovered criminal networks that had distributed fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used multiple fraudulent identities and it has tracked and found escaping ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to its cooperation with INTERPOL, the international authority to combat crime, FISH-i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing across large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organized crime," "" "said Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that aims to help FISH-i locate suspicious ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly being developed, also helps to detect the illegal vessels that are happy to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "" "" "illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position," "" "says Duncan Copeland, chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO, who also deals with fisheries data and provides FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships turn off their automatic identification systems, so they can no longer be ordered by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland therefore helps to build a system that connects different levels of information. FISH-i will help to find criminal operating ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team of African nations really influence the undoubted global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes this.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened the Global Fishing Tour platform with Google and the Oceana Marine Environment Agency: a platform that provides satellite data and can be displayed anywhere in the world by means of the position of each tracking vessel.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "together with the neighbors, to get a better picture of who is doing - that simply makes sense," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and to bundle their resources to investigate." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this at a global level." "" "Pew Charitable Trust has a similar project in which a global system allows the persecution of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities not only detect criminals, but also deter them.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that were previously confiscated without license and hardly had consequences, now know that they are being watched.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries involved at FISH-i have now a 33% increase in fishery turnover since fishing boats buy more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia had helped to detect Greko 1, the inspectors found there on board towing nets, whose use is prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "other countries also notice these successes." "" "the effect is so strong that other countries now also copy us," "" "says Kiilu." "" "we have become an object of study." "" "in West Africa, several hundred million dollars disappear every year through illegal fishing." ""</seg>
<seg id="148">"" "in 2015 six countries joined together, to the so-called West Africa Task Force. they are also fighting illegal fishing, after exactly the same model as FISH-i." "" "With certainty, the goal is to create even more such initiatives and structures in other regions," "" "says Copeland." ""</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently FISH-i's youngest member country Somalia was able to announce its first big triumph: in October Greko 1, a ship sailing under false flag. and not only did the ship travel without licence and were used towing nets, which are now banned.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the ship was also invaded into forbidden waters reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "" "taking measures against Greko 1 is a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing," "" "Bergh says." ""</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time the proof that such a special, collaborative approach to protecting the oceans is actually working throughout the oceans.

<seg id="153">Street movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They are regarded as a protest against the government's decision to stop the referendum on the removal of President Nicolás Maduro.</seg>
<seg id="155">This picture by María Alejandra Mora shows a close-up of the demonstration in Maracaibo in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="156">Published under the Creative Commons License.</seg>
<seg id="157">After the government's government rejected the opposition's request for a referendum on a referendum, the Venezuelans responded, in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into the void while congregating on the streets.</seg>
<seg id="158">Under the hashtag # LaTomaDecVenezuela (for example: the refund of Venezuela) both pictures of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them can be found.</seg>
<seg id="159">The debate is also being conducted in other parts of the country - among others in the Barinas area, in the Andean regions Mérida and Táchira, in the central north-north of the Carabobo and on the Isla Margarita in the state of Nueva Esparta.</seg>
<seg id="160">The country's political and economic situation is continuously worsening what makes itself felt in the everyday life of the Venezuelans by an acute lack of food and medicines.</seg>
<seg id="161">Many representatives of the opposition saw the chance of a fundamental change in the removal of the current President Nicolás Maduro, but ultimately, the holding of a new election was blocked by official authorities.</seg>
<seg id="162">Marianne Díaz, Contributors at Global Voices in Venezuela, summarises in their latest article the context of the government decision as follows:</seg>
<seg id="163">In the context of the social, political and economic crisis, in which the rate of inflation and violence belong to the highest in the whole world (the inflation rate is estimated at 500% to the end of the year) and in which a grave and widespread lack of food and medicine exists, the referendum was considered to be the only way to give the country the chance to recapture its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance.</seg>
<seg id="164">The electoral alliance Mesa de la Unidad Democrática or MUD (roughly: round Table of the Democratic Unit), in which the opposition parties and political groups joined together, urged the demonstrators to participate in the campaign against President Nicolás Maduro. in addition, a twelve-hour strike on the Folgetag and a march to Miraflores Palace, the Venezuelan government, should continue to persist in office.</seg>
<seg id="165">The call was commented on Twitter, among other things, as follows:</seg>
<seg id="166">It is as far as Venezuela: tomorrow National Assembly, Friday nationwide civilian strike and on the 3rd of November all to Caracas to the Miraflores Palace.</seg>
<seg id="167">Tell me more! pic.twitter.com / 9ZyVGldNry</seg>

<seg id="170">The first demonstration in the context of the Action Programme "The Contracting of Venezuela" took place on Wednesday, October 26.</seg>
<seg id="171">The images of the marches published in real time testify among other things an overwhelming participation of the people in numerous areas of the country, but also confrontations with policemen and supporters of the government.</seg>

<seg id="176">On Twitter, images accumulate from confrontations, as well as reports of oppression and abuse.</seg>
<seg id="177">Especially large waves beat the news of police repression in the centrally located town of Maracay.</seg>
<seg id="178">The demonstrators went back to the local cathedral to protect themselves according to their own statement in front of the police and armed advocates of the government.</seg>
<seg id="179">Hours later they could safely leave the cathedral, but the protests continued.</seg>
<seg id="180">In other parts of the country, some demonstrators tried to stop police forces, including this woman in the Andean State Táchira:</seg>
<seg id="181">The women in Táchira don't wear skirts, because otherwise you could see something that many National Guards do not have!</seg>
<seg id="182">Meanwhile, an infographic already makes the round that forms the level of repression per day:</seg>
<seg id="183">Thus the dictatorship has suppressed the country.</seg>
<seg id="184">Many representatives of the government had challenged the validity of the demand for a tenure procedure - this has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the streets.</seg>
<seg id="185">Mystic's Media Labs for this:</seg>
<seg id="186">Nicolás and Diosdado claim that 1% of signatures are counterfeit.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here is your tenure of office!</seg>
<seg id="188">On the road!</seg>
<seg id="189">Others are evaluating these protests as a further step in the fight against a government that has taken little against the disastrous economic crisis and prefers to let critical voices be stopped:</seg>
<seg id="190">They took us so much - but also fear!</seg>
<seg id="191">The marches are increasing in frequency and intensity.</seg>
<seg id="192">Some Venezuelans reported the media that they were too hungry to participate in a strike, rather than work or go shopping.</seg>

<seg id="197">This is an adapted version of an interview by Alejo Gómez with Luis Quijano, which was published on August 23, 2016 on Día a Día, an Argentinean news page.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to see the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentine city of Córdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">As an adult man, Quijano now said to his father as part of the great La Perla Ribera trial in the province of Córdoba.</seg>
<seg id="201">In the trial which ended on 24 August 2016, crimes were being investigated that were committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano has not chosen his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father up to the brutal military operations in the prison La Perla, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years he kept his family secret.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time I thought that was all right.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child with 15 years, one does not notice that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">At that time I could not see that my father was a thief, torturer and murderer.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis Alberto had no choice: his father, Luis Alberto Quijano, was gendarmerie. during the Argentinean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a time of state terrorism, his father was the Deputy Commander of the Intelligence Department 141 in La Perla prison.</seg>
<seg id="210">Luis Alberto Quijano.</seg>
<seg id="211">Archive recording.</seg>
<seg id="212">But this is not the story of Luis Quijano, the oppressor, accused of kidnapping in 158 cases, torture, murder in almost 100 cases and kidnapping of a 10-year-old child.</seg>
<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quijanos son, a man who, over the years, recognized the extent of atrocities he had witnessed as a boy, and who testified before a federal court against his own father.</seg>
<seg id="214">His story shows the great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose a way of salvation.</seg>
<seg id="215">From the sports hall to the military base</seg>
<seg id="216">When my father started to take me to the military base, I often went to the sports hall with us. there I was friends with a boy who made martial arts.</seg>
<seg id="217">All called him "Kent."</seg>

<seg id="347">In the Japanese city of Kyoto, customers of a newly opened centre in which one can prolong one's driving licence were witnesses of a very badly misinterpreted translation last month.</seg>
<seg id="348">On a sign the Japanese word was wrongly translated as "older motorists" - but perhaps also with malicious hind thanks & # 8212; as "awful motorists" translated.</seg>
<seg id="349">The false translation was to be read on electronic displays in the entrance area and in the building itself from 1 to 20 September.</seg>
<seg id="350">Editing the original photos by Joshua Levine, which has been widely shared in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Holmes, a citizen of Kyotos. he was also aware of the local newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="352">The Kyoto newspaper Kyoto Shimbun, which has been published in Kyoto, wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"how could it come to such an English translation?</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation corrected.</seg>

<seg id="356">The "terrible drivers" (German: "awful drivers") was later replaced by the appropriate, if grammatically not quite correct designation "elder drivers" (German: "older drivers").</seg>
<seg id="357">The Kyoto Prefecture did not apologize for the translation error. furthermore, she explained that the error was already contained in the text she had received by the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported about the apology:</seg>
<seg id="359">"" "" "" "we are sincerely sorry that elderly people felt insulted by inadequate correction (translation) on our part," "" "said the police." ""</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-Cast News dealt with the phenomenon of "fearful" older motorists in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">The word "awful" has been denounced as an inappropriate description of elderly motorists. according to the police, the proportion of elderly motorists who are involved in accidents across the country is quite a matter of concern.</seg>
<seg id="362">In the Kyoto prefecture, for example, 1,941 of total 19,460 accidents were caused by seniors in 2005. this corresponds to a proportion of 10%.</seg>
<seg id="363">Ten years later, in 2014, senior citizens convicted 1,803 of a total of 11,850 accidents.</seg>
<seg id="364">As a result, their share rose to 17.7%.</seg>
<seg id="365">While the number of accidents has decreased overall, the share of accidents caused by seniors has risen in the same period.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">For translating, one needs two important skills: passive language skills to understand the original text and active language skills to translate it into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. generally, the conviction is that translators in the target language - not in the original language - should be native speakers.</seg>
<seg id="379">For example, a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French to English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ English as their native language, which could produce translations into English. this may be due to a lack of understanding of translation, cost reasons or the relatively low number of English native speakers who learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies that do not have foreign employees leave translations within the company. then the Japanese staff, whose English skills are rated as the best, are made translators - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translations are also widespread - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The verbalized and mysterious sentences that arise through machine translation indicate that this technique cannot yet replace a human translator. this is especially true for some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangest English phrases in Japan, including the mysterious prints that often adorn t-shirts or bags, are used only for stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless. however, by large companies or by the government who have the means to ensure higher standards, more accurate translations can be expected.</seg>
<seg id="389">In the future, the City of Kyoto will hopefully use a more reputable source of its translations.</seg>

<seg id="391">Homepage of the portal "Navasegar con Libertad" (Free surfing) of IPYS (Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, Institute for Press and Society).</seg>
<seg id="392">On Friday morning, 7 April, Venezuelan Internet users announced that they had no access to Vivoplay online.</seg>
<seg id="393">Other users later wrote that the internet presentations of VPITV and El Capitolio TV are no longer accessible.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online broadcasters also survived photographs of the protests in Caracas organized by oppositional groups opposing the government of Nicolás Maduros.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests started in early April, after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament's tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos Díaz, journalist and author of Global Voices, published the results of a traceroute. he pointed out that the connection was capped and advised the users to use VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="397"># censorship: enable your VPN.</seg>
<seg id="398">It seems that the web pages of Venezuelan providers are locked again.</seg>
<seg id="399">This is from the side of @ VivoPlayNet.</seg>
<seg id="400">Offers such as Vivoplay are popular with the Venezuelans with Internet access, especially in times of unrest.</seg>
<seg id="401">Traditional media have been reluctant to report protests since 2014. at that time, the Commission for Telecommunications threatened them with fines and closures if they continued to report on the demonstrations, as the Commission saw it as a "call to violence."</seg>
<seg id="402">Without cable TV and informative national TV channels, I have registered at @ vivoplaynet again.</seg>
<seg id="403">It is amazing that it is still cheaper than buying two litres of lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO, VEIT, later confirmed that not only Vivoplay was inaccessible through a blocking of the Domain Name System (DNS), but also two other online channels. this also applies to the website where the National Assembly transfers its sessions.</seg>
<seg id="405">Previous research by the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had shown that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS. this is a technique through which the DNS servers respond correctly to certain domains.</seg>
<seg id="406">If a website is blocked by the DNS, the server replies or refuses the request when calling such a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNS-lock: @ elcapitoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">At VPITV, a third locked channel, the broadcast was discontinued on Thursday, 6 April, when the VPITV cameraman Elvis Flores, who transferred the protests in Caracas, was arrested.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was beaten as he was in police custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">Eight hours later he was released, and VPITV went on air again.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, it has also been reported that the government regulates Internet connections: this makes the Venezuelans more difficult to access multimedia reporting about current events in the country.</seg>

<seg id="417">The article is part of a series entitled "Vacas que vuelan, Escuelas que Caen" ("Flying cows, falling schools") edited and re-released by Global Voices Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with her family who lived there.</seg>
<seg id="419">Shortly before her graduation from university she returned to the house once more and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride about her. "she is like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "she, from whom something has become," "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she was ten years old, she began to work as a Criadita for the family. as Criadita, in Paraguay the more than 46,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school.</seg>
<seg id="423">The business is quite simple: a large family with little money transfers their underage son or their underage daughter to another, more rich family. in exchange, the child receives food, a training and a roof over the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">But what is not mentioned here is that children have to pay for countless days of housework that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse can be - and all this within the framework of a treaty that cannot be lifted.</seg>
<seg id="425">This practice referred to as Criadazgo is widespread in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance of large parts of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organizations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After graduating, Alvarenga worked for a couple of years for an organization fighting for the rights of boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke with Criadita - especially young girls are affected by the practice of the Criadazgo - collected testimonies, researched and denounced.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to call things by name, because the feeling of gratitude that is inoculated to the critically guarantees in general silence.</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double deception," explains Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="430">On the one hand, there is the family, who have their daughter in the belief that they complete their education, improve their position in society, and "make something out of themselves," to another family.</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family who assimilates the girl and justifies her exploitation with faith is that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and perhaps even starved.</seg>
<seg id="432">Victims of the Criadazgo</seg>
<seg id="433">When the girl is ill-treated, his family will learn about it many years later.</seg>
<seg id="434">Sometimes they never know about it.</seg>
<seg id="435">In January 2016, the previously unknown phenomenon, which takes place in the hidden in paraguayan households, got a face.</seg>
<seg id="436">When Carolina Marín came to hospital in Caaguazú, her body showed traces of severe beatings. shortly thereafter she died.</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">She was in the household of Tomás Ferreira and his wife, Ramona Melgarejo, who works as a civil servant in the Einwohnermeldeamt.</seg>
<seg id="439">Marín lived with them in their house in Vaquería, a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital Asunción.</seg>
<seg id="440">At the end of January 2016, Ferreira had a stick on Marín until she suffered fatal injuries.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">A few days later the media reported on the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was a Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organizations like UNICEF or Callescuela blamed the practices of the Criadazgo deeply rooted in the Paraguayan society for the death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="445">They marked the Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people gathered in protest demonstrations and demanded that there should be "no other Carolina" in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The girl's name and photos were widely used in social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"in Paraguay, more cows are registered than children," said Tina Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="449">Without papers, it is much easier to violate the rights of children.</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbours of the couple and almost 60 civil society organisations called for a prompt investigation of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want Tomás Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="453">If the case comes to court, the case of Carolina Marín could be landmark - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Criadazgo will be brought to court.</seg>
<seg id="454">The life of a Criadita</seg>
<seg id="455">The Criadita are not only exploited as labour, they also live isolated from other girls at their age.</seg>
<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Farmer, in which her father worked, had to sign up bankruptcy and her father lost his work.</seg>
<seg id="457">Her brothers had to work all the way and started selling sweets on the street or on the market to earn money.</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent as Criadita to the capital Asunción.</seg>
<seg id="460">In the house of her employers, Alvarenga worked between four and six hours every day.</seg>
<seg id="461">She had to share the time in such a way that she still had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">She got up every morning at five o'clock and prepared breakfast for her employer.</seg>
<seg id="463">For example, they cleaned the fridge, cleaned the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the floor.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school was over, she went home again and had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="465">The more she finished learning, the more free time she had.</seg>
<seg id="466">But also this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers.</seg>
<seg id="467">Alvarenga says she never had to starve, but didn't get unlimited food. "I was allowed to bring more books from the library of the landlord as food out of the fridge," she remembers.</seg>
<seg id="468">The library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord, a former military and sympathiser of the Partido Liberal, a liberal party that was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, who was in power from 1954 to 1989.</seg>
<seg id="469">At some evenings the landlord Alvarenga forced to stand next to him and read editorials from opposition newspapers such as "Sendero" or "El Pueblo."</seg>
<seg id="470">He tried to convince them not to believe in the official media reports about the dictator's regime.</seg>
<seg id="471">"" "he thought it intelligently but did not pause with it." "" "the host found someone who listened while talking about politics," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="472">"" "" "" "they didn't allow me to visit my family because they thought that I would" "" "learn bad habits" "" "there again." "" "so they said that Alvarenga, who belongs to the indigenous group of Guaraní, would return home to his mother tongue Guaraní." ""</seg>
<seg id="473">Their gentleman feared that she would lose the education she had allowed her to lose, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="474">She was fully aware that she had paid for everything she got from them with her hard work.</seg>
<seg id="475">Even at school, Alvarenga was discriminated against. "one thing that is almost never talked about is mobbing and harassment being exposed to critically when they go to school.</seg>
<seg id="476">Because the other children have parents, they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents is a Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="477">I couldn't invite anyone home. I had no friends at school or in the neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="478">In my youth, at the time when friendships arise, I felt particularly clear that I belonged to no group.</seg>
<seg id="479">Isolation was the worst of all, "explains Alvarenga.</seg>

<seg id="487">The ad got five "Likes" and many comments.</seg>
<seg id="488">A woman from the village Ñemby wrote that she would have a eleven-year-old girl and gave her telephone number.</seg>

<seg id="497">In the course of our history we have managed to abolish systems such as slavery, Cuñadazgo (a practice from the early history of Paraguay, where the Spanish conquerors, the conquistadores, the women of Guaraní were enslaved and Spanish indoctrination), and the system of the Mensfelt (where the workers were treated as semi-slaves) and the native population had to go to a system of slavery, in which they become light victims for abuse and exploitation.</seg>

<seg id="500">Image of Pixabay, altered by Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="501">Published under Public Domain CC0.</seg>
<seg id="502">Sixty Egyptian MPs recently agreed to draft legislation on "regulating the use and use of social networks."</seg>
<seg id="503">"" "" "" "if it is accepted by the Parliament, users of social media in Egypt must register with a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter." ""</seg>
<seg id="504">"" "" "" "on the basis of the law, a place would be set up, which is tasked with granting citizens a permit to use social media." ""</seg>
<seg id="505">Within six months of adoption of the law, users on the site should register with their proper names and identity card numbers to be able to use social networks.</seg>
<seg id="506">If it fails to do so, it could result in a penalty of up to six months "imprisonment or a cash flow.</seg>
<seg id="507">The bill, which consists of six paragraphs and curses in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as "any application running across the Internet and used to communicate with others by voice, video tutoring and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law is enforced when it is adopted, as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities should make registration for users. unclear is also how they should account for those who do not register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not able to ensure regulation at the level of social media companies.</seg>
<seg id="509">Riyad Abdul Sattar, MP and promoter of the bill, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users and users received a username and password from the Ministry of Telecommunications to get through the firewall that blocks Facebook. "</seg>
<seg id="510">This could mean that Egypt plans to build a firewall on a national level around Facebook. because of which it would be necessary for Egyptians and Egyptians to file information about their identity in order to access the network.</seg>
<seg id="511">But it has not been known until now that such plans exist.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts on site are sceptical about the technical feasibility of the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="513">Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Technologist (in German "Senior Research Technician") at the Egyptian initiative for Human Rights (EIPR, in German "Egyptian initiative for personal rights"), told Global Voices:</seg>
<seg id="514">I strongly doubt the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things that have to do with technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">In my opinion, they imagine that just as they violently control physical public and private spaces, it could also be done online.</seg>
<seg id="516">If I take them seriously, it means they will set up a strong monitoring system to filter citizens that seek approval or not. and that means a crazy system to monitor people's activities and also to lead them to a court process.</seg>
<seg id="517">This is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="518">In order to be adopted as a law, the draft must first be discussed with the legislature and the constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate.</seg>
<seg id="519">Whether its acceptance and enforcement will succeed or not, the draft "stands in line with a pro-military way of thinking in parliament, in whose sense the control is maximized and assured that there is no aberration on the image surface," says Rao of.</seg>
<seg id="520">Last year, the parliamentary representative Tamer El-Shahawy proposed a bill against cyber crime in which a life-long prison sentence was intended for those who were found guilty of "threatening public order" and "to protest."</seg>

<seg id="525">High up in the mountains of Kurdistan region in the north east of Iraq, the animal protector Hana Ahmed Raza and her team of scientists from the non-governmental organization Nature Iraq are working on protecting the ghostly Persian leopards.</seg>
<seg id="526">A subspecies of the leopards, which strike through Africa and Asia, belong to the Persian leopards (Panthera pardus saxicolor). in total, there are between 800 and 1,000 animals, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature. they are endangered due to poaching, the loss and fragmentation of their habitat and since they find less and less loot.</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this particular type of leopard so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">"" "as Raza shows in the video," "" "the Persian leopard is the only remaining predator in the Kurdish ecosystem" "" "and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on a large predator." ""</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see a Persian leopard in the wild boar is low and goes against zero. as the team in the video thus determines that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera, Raza stops in sheer joy.</seg>
<seg id="530">As a trained biologist, Raza is passionately fond of another side of her country, which is not only of war and conflict.</seg>
<seg id="531">She has been involved in field studies on wild animals and educational programs by Nature Iraq for six years.</seg>

<seg id="539">"view from Shizugawa High School at Shizugawa, Minami Sanriku (Miyagi)."</seg>
<seg id="540">Shizugawa was destroyed by the tsunami on 11 March 2011 and the region is still occupied with reconstruction.</seg>

<seg id="544">In early March 2017, the Kahoku Shimpo, responsible for North East Japan, documented the progress achieved over the past six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the "triple catastrophe" of March 2011. a massive earthquake, a tsunami and an Atomic accident in Fukushima had caused the disaster.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, located in the Prefecture of Miyagi. the Prefecture of Miyagi was a number of prefectures in Japan's Northeast, which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbouring prefectures Fukushima and Iwate were seventeen evacuated because the tsunami had caused whole coastal towns to disappear from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">In addition, Fukushima prefecture experienced an atomic accident, already on its own account that 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">The Kahoku Shimpo's special report shows from the local point of view what progress has been achieved for six years to rebuild the life of the local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics of the Japanese rebuilding authority and survey results of the affected persons themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">The housing construction in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 percent of the scheduled spare parts (German) were completed in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi was able to list the biggest success among the three prefectures, where 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima forms the closing light with 70 percent.</seg>
<seg id="554">At the same time, six years after the disaster, the evacuated houses of Behelfsenterarriste (for the purpose of Reducting Kazetsu juutaku) were to resettle in final spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the triple catastrophe, almost 80 000 people were forced to live in temporary housing.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016, 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate lived in such homes.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of those evacuated from Fukushima in 2011 still live in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful. more than 75 percent of the evacuated who lived in homes after the disaster were resettled in final homes.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate, the number here is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three prefectures concerned</seg>
<seg id="560">As the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has been able to determine, 1074 of 1100 schools that were affected by misfortune have reopened their gates by December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later it is clear that industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While almost 100 per cent of the fishing harbours in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation, only 30 per cent of the fishing ports have resumed their operations in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the nuclear accident have affected large-scale suffering in the three prefectures of agricultural land.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi recovered 93 percent of its agricultural land, with only 66 percent of agricultural land in Iwate and less than 50 per cent destroyed farmland in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is just a consequence of nuclear accident, as only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of land destroyed by Fukushima lie in the "nuclear barrier zone."</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures tourism has recovered largely, but also here Fukushima remains far removed.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are again 90 percent at the same level as before the disaster. Fukushima, on the other hand, can only show 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal dwellers seem to be more difficult to earn their livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population being prepared for the next major earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to be able to determine an overall picture, the newspaper introduced numerous surveys among the local population and evacuation. she questioned her about the status of reconstruction and also how her feeling of feeling changed vis-à-vis the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction to the article Kahoku Shimpo explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to learn more about tsunami awareness among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey revealed that 83.1 percent of local residents have taken measures to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of respondents found that still not enough was done in terms of disaster prevention.</seg>
<seg id="575">As it stands for those who had to be evacuated from the Fukushima prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In its edition of the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has also focused its attention on the situation of the Fukushima evacuation.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had to witness not only the massive earthquake and the devastating tsunami, but the Fukushima prefecture was also a witness of the worst, disaster-induced, nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed.</seg>
<seg id="578">Almost 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the prefecture of Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016, more than 23,000 people, back to Fukushima, had been relocated to permanent spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="580">As of 2017, there are still 40,000 residents living outside of Fukushima outside of their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the disaster areas most of the evacuates are older than 50 years old. they are well known because the efforts to rebuild Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima have to compete with massive construction projects. these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo in 2020.</seg>

<seg id="583">When people meet people from other countries who speak a different language, the differences seem to be greater than the similarities.</seg>
<seg id="584">After a while, however, one often recognizes that more than it seems at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="585">These global connections are important as they challenge our prejudices, expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this episode of Into the Deep, the Global Voices Podcast, we look closely at these global connections. in our Into the Deep podcast we deal with issues that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve.</seg>
<seg id="587">We speak with five Global Voices members who remember a moment when they have felt very strongly connected to someone over language and country borders.</seg>
<seg id="588">Veroniki Krikoni talks about the similarities between Greek and Turkish; Tori Egherini explains how a migration has strengthened its affection for Iranian culture; Adriana Macias talks about the time when she worked with people from all over the world in London; and Joey Ayoub looks back on his experiences that he has collected in a small village in Madagascar.</seg>

<seg id="595">This week, a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was sent to the intensive care unit: last Friday, a police officer had hit him with a stroke against the head during a demonstration in Goiânia. millions of demonstrators took part in a protest march across the country.</seg>
<seg id="596">Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who studies social sciences at the Federal University of Goiás has suffered a skull-brain trauma and several fractures.</seg>
<seg id="597">Doctors operated him on this Saturday and moved him into an artificial coma.</seg>
<seg id="598">His condition is considered critical.</seg>
<seg id="599">The local photojournalist Luiz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mateus, which spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days.</seg>
<seg id="600">On the pictures is also the face of the police officer, who attacked with a stroke. the man was identified as Augusto Sampaio.</seg>
<seg id="601">After the incident, the military police were known in the Brazilian state of Goiás that Sampaio was suspended until the conclusion of the investigation into the incident of active service.</seg>
<seg id="602">The pictures show the police officer how he hits the face of the student Mateus Ferreira in Goiânia (photos: Luiz da Luz).</seg>
<seg id="603">If a police officer beaten up a demonstrator and land on the intensive care unit, his face would be on television for six months and the entire repression would be justified.</seg>
<seg id="604">The Facebook page "Desktalizador," a media channel by media activists from Goiânia, shared the video recorded by Luiz da Luz on the net in which you can see how Mateus is attacked by the police officer and several paramters are rushing to him shortly.</seg>

<seg id="625">The Unindustralization Forgotten Villages in Cuba</seg>
<seg id="626">With the introduction of the law of Álvaro Reynoso, nearly hundreds of sugar cane factories all over Cuba closed the doors (Photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The community of Gregorio Arleé Mañalich, located in the western Cuban province of Mayabque, is generally known as El Central - on Spanish sugar mill - despite the fact that there is no appreciable sugar harvest on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It was two years ago when the activities were paralyzed in the sugar cane factories.</seg>
<seg id="629">After the fall, the sugar cane industry stood still in the region, and the factory lost after and after its facilities, until only the framework of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">Approximately 272 workers had to reinvent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others resigned daily to the factories that still grind.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a veteran veteran who rose every day at 4: 00 o'clock in the morning, the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not deprive him of his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region, which are in operation after a long inactive period, because they have been preserved.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he didn't expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene recalls that in Mañalich the sugar cane factory would be preserved but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry already resisted plagues, the fall of socialism, low market prices, inefficiency, bad management decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016 production was 1.6 million tons of sugar, less than the quantity produced in 1910.</seg>
<seg id="639">The news would have been a motive for concern for the country several decades ago, but the bad harvests are no longer a news.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old platform of the church already saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity. the 155 sugar cane factories were technically outdated and hardly competitive for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production objective was 4 million tons.</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories that could produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0,03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution to unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives leading to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless, the sugar price rose again about a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the report published in 2016 by the OECD and FAO, the Agriculture and Food Organization of the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), raw sugar exports would generate around 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"" "" "" "today's day will certainly go into history," "" "that was the first words of Cuban President Fidel Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lavandero." ""</seg>
<seg id="653">From then on, the process of restructuring began in the sugar industry.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years the decommissioning of 98 sugar cane factories, more than 65 million people received their full salary for further training.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio Arlée Mañalich on May 14, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto Pérez has worked in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">When Nene, as known as a soldier, speaks about the closure of the factory, the word he repeats most is "scam."</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents said: not one of them informed that the factory was shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order for the place to be preserved, they formed a full-time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first anniversary of the Jubilee, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">These were officially written documents, which were distinguished only with regard to the parts that would be removed, the address and date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the minister could approve any withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on, the responsability was postponed and the letters became more and more frequent.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the abandoned factory for two years and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money for the sugar cane factories which were still in use," he assures.</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years old, waits for retirement in another facility, the Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He was involved against his will at the shutdown of the factory in which he helped to build.</seg>
<seg id="667">With every part he removed, he dismantled one of his 31 working years.</seg>
<seg id="668">The most developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important work bench was extinguished.</seg>
<seg id="669">In many cases, there were no alternatives for the jobs and services generated by the facilities in the municipalities where they were located.</seg>
<seg id="670">We will never know if during the mammoth speech of 21 October 2002, the former president looked into the eyes of the persons present, when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years, everything would go well.</seg>

<seg id="674">After two years the community of Gregorio Arleé Mañalich learned that many things change, but not always for the better when a factory is closed.</seg>
<seg id="675">When the sugar cane factory closed, or better said than they began to contaminate it, they also stopped biting the road, which also disadvantaged other farms.</seg>
<seg id="676">Without work in the region, and with advanced age, Nene and Eddy had to look for other factories.</seg>
<seg id="677">They became spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="678">Without a promising perspective, many young people left the region.</seg>
<seg id="679">A food factory was created in the area, the production of which is not even used for the supply of the community.</seg>
<seg id="680">The ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive.</seg>
<seg id="681">At the end of 2016 Nene came back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Coloma, the ruins of the place where he began to work.</seg>
<seg id="682">Ninety-nine harvests bring to the old soldier a pension of two thousand peso a month to spend the years retired in Mañalich.</seg>
<seg id="683">Mr. Nene, a man of black skin colour, small, with a few teeth and clear voice, is not a supportive person, yet he does not forgive the lies he told him.</seg>
<seg id="684">They have been torturing him for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="685">Nene is in retirement for 65 years, not because it lacks force, but because he is bitter.</seg>

<seg id="689">First Nations Children use Hip-Hop to express themselves and preserve their own culture</seg>
<seg id="690">"" "recording of a song by" "" "Home to Me" "" "- grassy Narrows First Nation." ""</seg>
<seg id="691">Photo used with approval by N'we Jinan.</seg>
<seg id="692">Youngsters of the First Nations communities across Canada are dealing with topics that are important to them. they do this using Hip-Hop, thanks to a series of hiking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan tour, workshop leaders have been bringing mobile recording studios to schools and youth centres for youth groups to teach songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were conducted by the educator David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked in North Quebec with ten Cree-communities and then with the Cree Hip-Hop Group The Northstars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop thus emphasises that the young participants encounter themes such as "cultural identity, language, conflict, love, self acceptance," or whatever comes to mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Winnebago in the U.S. state of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' Yoo in the territory of the tribal head of the Kitumkalum First Nation in British Columbia tells of example the history of Highway 16, also called "Highway of tears," a section in West Canada where nearly two dozen mostly indigenous young women were disappeared or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were largely unexplained.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important it is to preserve traditional customs and customs despite the influences of globalisation.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the young people do not always master the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation have recorded, the refrain is sung at Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved got some help from Gary Jolly from the Northstars hip-hop band who gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay Cree dialect.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebook page of N'we Jinan the verse is available, as well as a translation into English, which is translated into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to continue my days on Earth</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day when you will hear our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because as a youth we have lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will rise one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">This way they can grow and also precede our youth</seg>
<seg id="712">So they can do what they have determined for the Creator</seg>
<seg id="713">In the comments section, the reader and supporters of the Cree language Kevin Brousseau also contribute and add the verse in syllabad (which is published on his blog and published here with permission):</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan, one can see plastic dishes almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show potential customers what is exactly on the menu, in the vicinity of the entrance shokuhin sanpuru (we introduce the "Plasma Elections of the Courts") from every dish that is served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers can see these plastic dishes and decide whether they will enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the Tokyo district of Kappabashi there are a large number of these small companies producing plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented over 20 years ago in his film Tokyo-Ga.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese these plastic dishes are so common that they don't even notice them anymore. however, a new trend is turning them into showy cell phone accessories and other gadgets today.</seg>
<seg id="724">At Naver Matome, the Blogger itinii published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new plastic ribbons, decorated with plastic ribbons, as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods have been turned into kitschy collective items, as in this case, fridge magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few Shokuhin refrigerators magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in food production is becoming more and more complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case an kaisen-don (a popular rice dish with seafood) was transformed into a cell phone stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as a cell phone stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also made this part of the exhibition at the Tokyo station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that holds your cell phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And that is only the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile phone stands and mobile phone designers allow you to produce your own artwork. in this case ikura and laughter are used, a popular topping that is served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">Some users had their doubts on Twitter:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "there is someone who would say:" "" "wow, cool, now I can decorate my cell phone with laughter?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic courts can also take on a less appetizing form, for example to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile phone stand has the form of melted ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also rice balls (Onigiri), earrings and handybands made of dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">For more bizarre plastic dishes, please refer to: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow us on Twitter the hashtag #.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you would like to learn more about the origins of this trend, this video gives you an insight into the district of Kappabashi, which is dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports of domestic and foreign media about the notorious "Fight Against Drug Trafficking" in Mexico, the missists and killed regularly appear only in statistics, but these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle entails.</seg>
<seg id="750">Reporting on drugs bosses such as El Chapo Guzmán, the leader of the Sinaloa cartel, pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">The day after a violent incident nobody looks at the mourners or the churches who have learned to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">There are behind every body, behind every bone find in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories of innumerable parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds may never heal.</seg>
<seg id="753">That is why the Mexican news portal Animal Político has launched the digital project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "living with the drug trafficking"), telling these victims a voice and telling stories of people who were in the fight between the law enforcement agencies and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project like this:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organized crime not only makes us afraid of our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are much more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, when shops close because they are threatened by drug dealers and entire communities therefore have to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk.</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of the victims</seg>
<seg id="759">A video titled "Vidas que Cambian por el miedo" (German: "how fear changes") tells exactly these stories.</seg>
<seg id="760">A main character is Guadalupe, a father looking for secret tombs every weekend to his son.</seg>
<seg id="761">Or Emma Veleta Rodríguez, who lost her father, her four siblings, her husband and two of her nephews, on only one day.</seg>
<seg id="762">"" "priests:" "" "as every Sunday we prepare for the task that we have set ourselves to go and search for tombs, according to the people we have loved." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="763">Guadalupe Contreras: "my son is Antonio Ivan Contreras Mata.</seg>
<seg id="764">He was 28 when he disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="765">He has three children.</seg>

<seg id="771">You are the insurance of my father, but she doesn't pay them out because they require a death certificate.</seg>
<seg id="772">"" "where shall we get them?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of Aprender a vivir con el Narco explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">"" "" "" "we must not only show the faces of those who fear. we have to show the international community the conflicts, fragility, and leadership." ""</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a reader of Animal Político, wrote this article from Taxco, in the State of Guerrero in Central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal, no matter what form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I have known disease and sensationalism for several years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I pass every day at the newspaper kiosks and see the front pages with pictures, which can only come from a textbook for criminology or from files of specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the frame.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She continues writing:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks he wants to become a Narco (German: drug dealer) when he is big. and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the "heroic deeds" of offenders when they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me it's as if they are scoring those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something has happened to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness if stories become mere numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"" "the infutility of the people is incredible to me when the death of six people and the enforced disappearance of 43 students in a neighbouring village are justified by the fact that they were" "" "soaked" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they try to convince themselves that they remain unaffected by such tragedies if they do not stir and remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution "Four months of blackmail in the Capital District: how a family was plundered with threats." it describes how armed criminals squeezed money from their business for month until they destroyed not only the business, but also torn down their family.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you've lost and how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain never passes away, the trauma remains, the fear comes up again when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, telephone numbers too.</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The farther we are from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She concluded with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want the others to be arrested because you don't know when they will kidnap or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">I asked myself in these terrible days whether weeping would dissolve my deep-rooted feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I have to learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">"" "the journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the article" "" "The Forgotten Children of Ciudad Juárez: a Generation of Violence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he raises questions like: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">What is it like to grow in a settlement on the edge of Mexico's most dangerous city?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents care for them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a orphan and he tells that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg, make potatoes, tortillas warm and make "Chichi" for the babies who live with him. this is his name for preparing the bottles with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy for whom the whole life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was past two years before, when he was only a few blocks away from his home, seeing the bloody corpse of his father who had been shot by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006, when violence was mixed by organized crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010, Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders according to the Civil Council for Public Security and the Government of the United States Government.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone the prosecutor numbered 3103 murders. this equates to 8.5 murders per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and invade the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories continue to live in the face of new headlines. but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco," Animal Político has launched the data journalism project Narcodata, whose aim is to portray the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking, which has tormented the country over the last four decades.</seg>
<seg id="816">If a picture is worth a thousand untrue words</seg>
<seg id="817">"sharing is Caring" by Flickr user Niklas Wikström (CC-BY-NC 2.0) WARNUNG: this article and the pages to which it links, contain images on which violence is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="818">The factor check is important at a moment when it comes to picking up a rumor or exposing a falsification.</seg>
<seg id="819">But how is the year after something has appeared for the first time? content in social media, whether true or untrue, tends to continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="820">Let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first publication, it has been misleading to portray tragedies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This false coupling of image and event - "wrong description" or "wrong context" in terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there is plenty of careful coverage of events in DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for pictures to messages.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010, a tanker crossed the town of Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tilted around and exploded. 230 people died.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war, Africa's second largest country had been neglected for years and devastated. roads in the region became dangerous paths full of potholes that were difficult to drive.</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically, it fell victim to the tank truck.</seg>
<seg id="828">Government officials described a fireball, which enveloped dozens of houses including a movie theater near which was full of people watching the World Cup Championship.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses scattered and cabled corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned for lack of knowledge.</seg>
<seg id="831">A picture with the title "This is Nigeria." from Imgur user Mystical Monkey, January 12, 2015.Several pictures of the incident are depicting the horrible scenes of this day.</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of charred bodies that are strung on the ground while people look at them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story does not end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years the same photo was taken up several times on social media, blogs and other platforms and wrongly attributed to real tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, militants from the Boko Haram attacked the remote villages of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses drastically reported atrocities before they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "but the numbers could not be confirmed." "" "nobody left to count corpses," "" "said a Human Rights Watch." ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many were dismembered, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only on the basis of satellite images the follow-up time could be visualized.</seg>
<seg id="844">The occasion for the attack was also unclear, but the army base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigerias and the attempt of Boko Haram to win country (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture from the DR Kongo turned over again when it was falsely presented as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this misuse of the image from the DR Kongo is only one in a number of abortions; Africa Check has documented assignments on Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases the image was presented as a testament to mass killings.</seg>
<seg id="852">One step further, personal comments such as this example falsely relate to the image from the DR Kongo with sources of mass media in order to provide arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The image from Sange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of Rohingya Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a report published by the United Nations, those who could flee were beaten, rape and several dead, some by burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported about the violence against the Rohingya, posts like the following came up, who brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news page, which falsely claimed that Myanmar's Than Being, monks and politicians had taken part in the assassination of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the image from the DR Congo to paint this information.</seg>
<seg id="857">The original contribution, which was last accessed on April 26, 2017, can be accessed here.</seg>
<seg id="858">Other news organizations, who called AFP as their source, also wrongly attributed to Thein being that statement, but did not have the picture taken from the DR Congo.</seg>
<seg id="859">The global reach of false data</seg>

<seg id="905">This judgment, which has been published exclusively in English, also refers to counterfeit images of odors that are used by Hate Speech and used by extremist groups to demonstrate that Muslims exterminate Buddhists and vice versa (which is often spread by Burma nationalists).</seg>
<seg id="906">"" "Russia, 2012." "" "Fareристикестикесткескескеска}" "" "(Christianophobia or political provocation?)." ""</seg>
<seg id="907">This post pointing to the members of the Russian Orthodox community clearly states that the image of the DR Congo does NOT show Muslims who kill Christians.</seg>
<seg id="908">Saudi Arabia, 2012 / 2014.</seg>
<seg id="909">This news page wrongly claimed that the President of Myanmar demonstrated his 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Rohingya Muslims and brought together the story with the image from Sange.</seg>
<seg id="910">The article was updated in 2014 and, at the time of publication, the picture is still contained in it.</seg>
<seg id="911">Spain, 2015 / 2016.</seg>
<seg id="912">This article of 2014 about students, who had been killed by the Boko Haram, published by the recently deleted, the Catholic close to the news page, Análisis Digital, has expressly declared that the image does not come from the killings, but it claims that there is a "similar dschicoup attack."</seg>
<seg id="913">When the picture was subsequently circulated in connection with the Boko Haram massacre of 2015, the newspaper El Pais tried to refute that there were connections to Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="914">"" "Turkey, 2015." "" "# NijeryaYanıyorDünyuy" "" "(Nigeria burns, the world is sleeping)." ""</seg>
<seg id="915">The image of the DR Congo, provided with this Twitterhashtag, triggered a discussion among Muslims after the Boko Haram massacre in 2015 and the attack on Charlie Hebdo in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="916">They wanted their communities to pay greater attention to these events, presumed in the name of Islam.</seg>
<seg id="917">United States, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="918">The image was weathered as evidence of the Boko Haram massacre in 2015 (and more than 9,300 times). but the messages associated with it were not taken up in any religious context.</seg>
<seg id="919">Instead, the aim was to pay attention to the relative number of deaths and comparing media coverage in comparison with Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Hebdo.</seg>
<seg id="920">Vietnam (German), 2014.</seg>
<seg id="921">After a message that was allegedly written by a "Father Juan Carlos Martos" on the Nigerian massacre, there were discussion forums like this on Vietnamese and declared it to be unregistered.</seg>
<seg id="922">From the embassy in which the image from the DR Congo was included, the organization of the Claretinmissionaries and Fr. Juan Carlos Martos distanced themselves.</seg>
<seg id="923">There are further confirmed examples of incorrect use of the image from Sweden, Poland, Belgium, the Netherlands and Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="924">Other accounts, aggregators and pages in the following countries (on the Gray folder) also exhibit inks, but are no longer fully traceable: Czech Republic, Australia, India, Peru, Netherlands, Ethiopia, Sri Lanka, Azerbaijan, Japan and possibly China.</seg>
<seg id="925">(data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the crawler and occasionally have image file names associated with Nigeria or Rohingya Muslims.)</seg>
<seg id="926">In all of these cases, which appeared clearly after the original item of 2010, the picture may eventually have a correct description, but the original contribution is not available or accessible.</seg>
<seg id="927">Frames and images</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong themes or frames that let these posts go through. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photograph was used in relation to greater discussion of the silence in connection with the killings of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the killings of Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the picture to discuss how an African life is undervalued compared to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">Understanding religion and the value of human life is both important. therefore, it is worth examining how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">A deeper question, however, is what happens when readers no longer believe these images.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media, there are tens of people who inadvertently share the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Does this sentiment of false and falsehood suggest that actual atrocities are untrue and diminish the actual horror of what has actually happened in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of violent images has already been extensively debated (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">One argument is that the retention of images of a refusal is equivalent to acknowledging the tragedy. sometimes, these images are even required by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern is that forcible images are desensitizing readers and viewers and the ability to feel empathy (such as this study, which investigated how violent media act on helping others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is a lot to discuss in the news media with regard to violence, the fact is that they are indispensable for today's news reporting.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists are experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against "fake news." they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something that can actually be used either from context or completely abusive way.</seg>
<seg id="940">However, any investigation of incorrect supplements should also take into account how international they can be.</seg>

<seg id="944">A blog with the name untranslatable (e.g. irreplaceable) strives to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not to translate at all.</seg>
<seg id="945">Such words exist in every language: they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these irreplaceable words are already well-known today (like the famous Portuguese Saudade) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture (such as the Spanish Sobota).</seg>
<seg id="947">But everyone stubbornly resist any attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">A word or expression is not enough, which is why a full explanation and sometimes a context are needed to understand exactly what is meant by this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists deal with Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, while the author and linguist of "untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">In the blog you can find, for example, words from the VAT-clap language of Vanuatu, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" - get your parents in recognition of the way around you in your younger years.</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunsrl language spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"kwadi" - The comfort or laziness that you feel after getting warmed in the sun during cold days.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds's own words from his blog about:</seg>
<seg id="956">They unveil other cultures, reveal other thoughts and awaken our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classify the linguists on this site want to publish more of these "irreplaceable" words and show how different, valuable, and impressively these little languages are.</seg>

<seg id="970">The island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood and landslide catastrophe in this decade.</seg>
<seg id="971">Triggered by the monsoon, which usually ends at the end of May, the rivers Kalu, Kelani, Gin, Nilwala and Attanagalu Oya have stepped over the banks in 15 districts in the south and west of the country.</seg>
<seg id="972">Following an opinion from the Sri Lankan catastrophal centre from May 28, 2017, 126 people were killed and almost 100 people are missed due to the floods and sludge winches.</seg>
<seg id="973">Over 400,000 people have been affected since last Friday (26 May) and around 100 000 people were brought to 304 safe places of residence.</seg>
<seg id="974">The rainfalls continued on Saturday (27 May) and the water levels in some areas were slowly returning.</seg>
<seg id="975">Health and hygiene conditions of the population are a massive challenge in the affected and still inaccessible areas.</seg>
<seg id="976">The following images and videos convey an impression of the scale of the flood disaster:</seg>
<seg id="977">Floodwater in Tawalama city with water stands of up to 7.5 meters. Twitter users like Azzam Ameen and Sri Lanka Tweet deliver regular updates to the high water situation.</seg>
<seg id="978">Many use the hashtag # FloodSL to monitor the scale of the disaster.</seg>
<seg id="979">Sri Lanka's deadly floods are worsening the Dengue crisis, Save the Children, after further rainfalls are already on their way.</seg>
<seg id="980">This morning, the Neluva bus stood in the high water, water level up to 6 meters. village of Moragoda near Galle also flooded due to the water pegger of Morogoda Ela.</seg>
<seg id="981">The Air Force has provided five planes for rescue operations and further five are being dispatched for the transportation of emergency supplies to the inhabitants locked in their flooded villages.</seg>
<seg id="982">Various organizations and startups have also agreed to help.</seg>
<seg id="983">Facebook pages like Help Flood Victims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Disaster Relief - Information Desk- Sri Lanka provide important information about flood situations and humanitarian aid.</seg>
<seg id="984">If any search and rescue teams need drones for their operations, please call 0774844639.</seg>
<seg id="985">For those who want to donate dry food and essential goods for flood victims -</seg>
<seg id="986">We are now in the area around Keleniya and Himhalana.</seg>
<seg id="987">Please call today the number 0777449729 or 0777843841 if animals in this area need help.</seg>
<seg id="988">The taxi call app PickMe (Sri Lanka) asks concerned people to share their location data with the help of the app, so that the data centre is informed.</seg>
<seg id="989">Last year after the disaster of the tropical storm Roanu, Pickens introduced a "flood relief" button that allowed users to call a vehicle to pick up assistance and donations. these were then sent for free to the Sri Lankan Red Cross.</seg>
<seg id="990">They also introduced a "SOS" key, which resulted in more than a thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for people included in flood and landslide.</seg>
<seg id="991">The combined efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka, where several social media platforms are fully exploited, bring people in need for security and provide assistance.</seg>
<seg id="992">This has prevented the loss of other human lives, and Sri Lanka's population now has the long way to restore normality.</seg>

<seg id="1004">They have had to kidnap me.</seg>
<seg id="1005">There are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="1006">We do not all look alike.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We practice our religion differently.</seg>
<seg id="1008">We identify ourselves with being Muslim in different ways. but somehow we all are put in the same Muslim drawer.</seg>
<seg id="1009">This drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims, who do not fit into it, are being demized.</seg>

<seg id="1017">Islam, the Quran and Prophet Muhammad were the center of his poetry until the day he died.</seg>
<seg id="1018">But in the western show, the religion of Rumis was erased, just like the most popular translations of its poetry.</seg>

<seg id="1025">I worked for thirteen years in the news industry and I saw how these powerful, flawed narratives dominate our newsfeeds.</seg>

<seg id="1027">This Narrative fails to recognize that when French, Muslim women are prevented from wearing their headscarf in public buildings, and Saudi Arabian, Muslim women by their government are forced to cover their entire body, which are both sides of the same coin.</seg>

<seg id="1031">It deletes the existence of Queer Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This narrative has cast down our collective imagination so deeply and flawed that Sikh men and children often become the goal of anti-Muslim attacks and harassment.</seg>
<seg id="1033">Because of these stories, which we tell and because of the way we tell them, Islamophobia is not only fear of Islam, religion, but fear of the "other."</seg>

<seg id="1128">But these are not concepts that we usually throw in our schools around us or which we read in our newspapers.</seg>

<seg id="1130">We all have to ask ourselves why?</seg>
<seg id="1131">Why do I tell this here at this TEDx Talk 2017 in Stanford, where Edward Said, the man who showed us how wars will be fought and people are recomplied with by creating the "other" in the public imagination, four decades ago was a scientific assistant at Stanford.</seg>
<seg id="1132">We have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of being conscious and unaware of the "other." as my girlfriend and I imagine in the rain during the Women's March, because the occupation we have no president, the chocolate cake, while he already bombed some broken countries and "other made" people goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion.</seg>
<seg id="1133">It starts here with all of us.</seg>
<seg id="1134">Initiative for narrative art aims to preserve urban language diversity</seg>
<seg id="1135">Story telling, by Flickr-user Daniele Rossi, using the license CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Can there be a way to contact someone here and now despite a language barrier?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Treasure Language Storytelling initiative (TLS), telling stories in their original language is a possible answer.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird, the unsurpassable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, the focus of TLS is not on the written word but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and honor the multitude of languages of big cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin lie in Australia or Oakland in the United States where TLS has already held events since 2015, the risk that small and not so small languages are not passed on to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">The following applies to the feasibility of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that embrace diversity - safe spaces where residents do not have to forget who they are to belong.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while" "" "listening to it often involves understanding" "" "these events instead" "" "listening to assessing, feeling, feeling." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, storytellers put their story first in their own language and then translate or explain them in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even though the participants are not a professional story teller, their devotion and their representation make it possible for the audience to listen to it.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They evoke laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows, for example, a traditional story from Burkina Faso, which is told in the language of Dafing. during this turn, the storyteller Rassiduou Konate seizes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of storytelling.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event, John Nyamusara tells the fable of the rabbit and the Baboon in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">After explaining the meaning of his beak, John Nyamusara is asked: "how is it to speak to an audience that does not understand your language?" with a wide grin, he shares his sense of inclusiveness:</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">Until now, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organizers hope to extend this. anyone who is inspired by the project can get in touch with TLS to organize their own story teller shows.</seg>

<seg id="1155">With the aim of a re-examination of Puerto Rico's public debt, which amounts to 72 million US dollars, various religious and civil organizations took part in a mass demonstration on 3 April 2017; the march started with the African Capitol, the government building of the capital, and went to Plaza de Colón in the old town of San Juan.</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was proclaimed by the grouping "Frente Ciudadano por la Auditoría de la Deuda."</seg>
<seg id="1157">The advocates of the reconstitution of debt have also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their requirement:</seg>

<seg id="1182">The Syriac-Palestinian web developer Bassel Khartouil, also known as Bassel Safadi, has been missing for over a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and supporters continue the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he made for an open network.</seg>
<seg id="1185">At this year's re: Publica, the annual conference on digital culture, which is hosted in Berlin, an event dedicated to the # FreeBassel campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Mélanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara Rühling, managing director of Book Sprints, a publishing house produced by so-called 'Book Sprints' completed books within three to five days, read extracts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The cost of freedom: a collective research).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book published last year and is available here royalty-free contains a series of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a tribute to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it reads:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book seeks to discuss how movements are built for free knowledge and what the true costs are with which this is connected.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movement for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our newsfeeds and to create some sense of our various experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartoum, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15, 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was removed from the directory of the Adra prison, in which he sat on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then, we have no information about its present state or place of residence.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book titled Collective Remembrance gives his friends and his family a voice that is pushing for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom, instantly.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Seeing how Bassel pays a high price for its participation in a free culture has led many of us to think about their own destinies, deeds and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of temporary extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital assets has been in the detention of Syrian government agencies since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military institution, to an unknown place.</seg>
<seg id="1202">"" "his wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the" "" "Military Police Bassel" "" "had taken part of a" "" "strictly secret" "" "command of the military court from his cell in Adra." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that she had been contacted by people on 12 November 2015 who accused himself of being an inside of the Assad government and notified them of an alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">However, his place of residence and condition remains unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of creative commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist, and currently managing director of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Bassels's cultural prototypes was more pretentious than the work he began with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyra.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the crossroads of numerous civilizations, and here Greek-Roman architectural styles merge with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">At that time, Bassel was not able to know that ten years after he started working, the IS would do everything to embody this architecture, which embodies not only the cultural heritage of Syria but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This expedition into digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule which will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically, Bassel could not finish this project yet.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about her husband's passion to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my entire life dreaming of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel taught me English, even when he was already in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I have learned to read, write and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with everyone who has asked. he has taught others to read, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He taught me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught other prisoners how to use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Waiting), a commission that she wrote in 2012 and 2015 to her husband when he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together on the book for one year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated it from Arabic into English.</seg>
<seg id="1224">The book is available without licence.</seg>

<seg id="1226">The book is dedicated to the public domain.</seg>
<seg id="1227">Here is an excerpt from the book of Nora titled "It happens":</seg>
<seg id="1228">It happens at every visit,</seg>
<seg id="1229">That I sink in the world of your beautiful eyes,</seg>
<seg id="1230">That I lose my mind at the moment in which we embrace,</seg>
<seg id="1231">That each of the dangers doesn't care for me,</seg>
<seg id="1232">Each of the fences, fetters and guardians</seg>
<seg id="1233">I forget the crush of the prison</seg>
<seg id="1234">And I enter every detail of your voice and words</seg>
<seg id="1235">Which I carry with passion with me,</seg>
<seg id="1236">When your eyes say goodbye</seg>
<seg id="1237">And I will leave another piece of my soul with you...</seg>
<seg id="1238">I quickly return to my loneliness,</seg>

<seg id="1248">Since the start of the protests in 2011 against Bashar al-Assad's regime, more than 65,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights (Syrian Network for Human Rights).</seg>
<seg id="1249">Those who were arrested or disappeared under the regime of violence were tortured or even executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">Until 2016, according to the international human rights organisation Amnesty International, at least 17.723 Syrians have died in jail since 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many other people remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1252">The Global Voices community has been calling for the release of Bassel since 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1253">Today, we reiterate our demand in the hope that we have to do this for the last time.</seg>
<seg id="1254">Mozambique: back on previous post, due to corruption-induced governor</seg>
<seg id="1255">Mozambique reacted to a corruption case in which a member of the government returned to the workplace in the state machine after half of his prison sentence where corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">It was Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other defendants on account of an embezzlement of 54 million Metics (around 800 000 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds of the airports of Mozambique, whose council managed Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 for good guidance and immediately called for its re-adjustment to the company, which took place on April 19.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement by the Attorney General of the Republic requesting the motion, there would be no reason for Cambaza to return to its old position, since the company did not undergo disciplinary proceedings following its imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many inhabitants don't like the action well.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade Pública, short CIP), a local institution committed to public transparency, condemned the decision of the company to re-establish the director in an interview with Deutsche Welle:</seg>
<seg id="1262">"" "" "" "represents a setback in the fight against corruption and clarifies the lack of transparency and is even a step backward in terms of the efforts of our legal system, such as CIP." ""</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we are aware of is that the company should have initiated disciplinary proceedings against the offending one.</seg>
<seg id="1264">However, the company apparently remained silent and did not take appropriate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">"" "Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the Mozambican social media, also rejects this behavior and considers the case as" "" "contradictory" "" ":" ""</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza was a competent person, he would be counselor after he was sentenced to prison and half of which had been cut off.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could keep paying lectures and motivating speeches, he could advise and polish his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent he consented to be integrated into the company, which he helped to inflict damage.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it is obvious: Cambaza will gladly pay for its silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Undisgusted!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says that the director has no morals:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza was rewarded by the state because he offended him I cannot believe that someone was rewarded in such a way that the state has already so massively insulted the state.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza lacks the moral to return and serve the state, * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead only served himself by the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as it was an inexhaustible source of money and the state itself has become tired of this man who was precharged and eventually sentenced to a long prison term.</seg>
<seg id="1275">To be honest, I don't know why this man was so rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey Zeúte prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, that a thief belongs to prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves are part of Samora Machel's prison will not only be remembered by the Mozambians as the first independent president, but also as a sharp, single-edged and - by the way - prophetic speakers.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of his most famous oral portrayals was when he strongly affirmed that "an ambitious person is capable of anything, even the fatherland for his ambitions, his own individual interest, to sell."</seg>
<seg id="1279">Samora also said: "I don't know if an ambitious person changes, my experience shows that it is not so. he changes tactics, but he does not turn away from his ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="1280">An ambitious person is criminal at the same time. "</seg>
<seg id="1281">In Twitter, the reactions were also negative:</seg>
<seg id="1282">Cambaza was sentenced to 22 years in prison; he sat for 10 years and was free.</seg>
<seg id="1283">And today the company, with which he reputates money, uses him again under contract. # AssimVaiOMeuPais - blueidosysses (@ azmal _ Rafik) May 12, 2017</seg>

<seg id="1286">Facebook blocks the racist word "Kalar" in Myanmar and censors many users unjustly</seg>
<seg id="1287">The Burmese word "Kalar pae" means chickpeas or splits basses.</seg>
<seg id="1288">Photo by Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported</seg>
<seg id="1289">According to information from Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took their posts from the network because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although the origin of the word is still discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin, or generally used as an adjective "Indian."</seg>
<seg id="1291">Facebook censors the word "Kalar" or as a part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network.</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely depreciatory connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word commonly used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims who represent a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">"Kalar" may be associated with racism today, but the word itself does not automatically appeal to hate speech.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that even posts in which they have discussed the use of the word have been censored in order to express their use.</seg>
<seg id="1297">In addition there are several Burmical words with basic meanings that have the same sequence of letters as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, it is written on Burmesisch also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words like 'Kalar pae' (spider bse), 'Kalar OAT' (Kamel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Faceboocracker Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post from one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he asked his friends in a witty way whether they knew how to alleviate his back pain by making a pun.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The proposition of ku la - "healing" (ku) + the question word (la) on Burmisch - resembles the racist expression very, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Htet is of the opinion that she will reduce hate speech by radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook needs to be more analytical before deleting all posts suspected of spreading racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">"" "Facebook does not delete the word" "" "Kalar" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automatism will not understand what you write on facthook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead is to carefully analyze the mail and control it by checking the words next door.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example, "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae."</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that these dirty nationalists, who spread hate speech, get a pretty good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action may send a strong signal to everyone who disseminates hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China, such as Sina Weibo and WeChat, have proven that the censorship of catchwords is often a cat and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or an alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook started deleting his posts after he just wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' was banned from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I became aware of this new directive from Facebook, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my post was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to read, post and share content for 24 hours because the post "denied the Facebook community standards."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a multiplicity of posts from people who have no negative intentions or simply try to show their opinions to the hate speech of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, which has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author expressed his opinion on why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more prior to the beginning of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community asking for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook may have a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma by its platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">To censor such words will bring even more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">In addition, it seems as if they have started this without a local context or technical support and have banned words such as "chair" or "peas curry."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the falsely deleted posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a great deal of turnover, that would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebook's automatic censorship has provided a lot of ridicule among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word 'Kalar' in the context of hate speech, to see if their posts are taken off the grid.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts, which contained no hate speech but were removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmese text reads: "I want to sit on a chair and eat peas curry and watch an Indian movie.</seg>
<seg id="1332">Just to try out if Facebook removes the mail containing the word Kalar. "</seg>
<seg id="1333">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1334">"" "the post says" "" "If you are a doctor, do you then heal people?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1335">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Over the past five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists who have used social networks to expand their voices and influence have increased.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, hate speech in social networks is to additionally heat the violence in the communities in Myanmar, especially in the Rakhine area, where there were thousands of confrontations between Muslims and Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook has been criticised for his failure to control the evasive hate speech on his Burmese sides.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But instead of simply censoring the word 'Kalar', it would have looked better on context than code-focused initiatives and learned from them.</seg>

<seg id="1350">Nevertheless, everything went smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "a Hindu leader, for example, had no hesitation in saying to the critics of the" "" "child marriage" "", "they should take care of their own affairs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition sparked tensions in this really uncomplicated matter, and at some point doubts arose whether the opposition would agree with the draft bill.</seg>
<seg id="1353">Yet at the beginning of 2017, the bill against child marriage was decided - in spite of 4 senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent one who abstained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him a law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now only the president of the country must agree and declare the law.</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the country's senators gave a status update on Facebook, which Leslie-Ann Boiselle again posted on Instagram:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill against child marriage was voted in the House of Representatives with 35 votes and no one against it.</seg>
<seg id="1357">Having been decided beforehand in the Senate, the draft can now become a law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of social media users were thrilled because the laws of childbirth have finally been changed.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Facebook member Lovell Francis, who is a ministerial office in the Ministry of Education, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">It took too much time and unnecessary talk that concealed the heart of the matter, but do you know what? the woe is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago, and that is worth almost every price.</seg>
<seg id="1361">While Abel Jackson was of the opinion, it was definitely long enough to abolish the practice, Lara Quentral-Thomas was overjoyed that the day had finally come:</seg>
<seg id="1362">Public Status Update on Facebook from Lara Quentrall- Thomas, which says: News!</seg>
<seg id="1363">The law has been decided.</seg>
<seg id="1364">Minimum age - 18, Voices - 35 for it - 0 against it!!!! "</seg>
<seg id="1365">Behind Mutota, affiliated with the Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD), a civil society group, who openly spoke about the importance of the adoption of the law, noted:</seg>
<seg id="1366">The marriage age in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent of religious affiliation 18 years.</seg>
<seg id="1367">The amendment to the amendment to the married couple was adopted today, 9 June 2017.</seg>
<seg id="1368">There are 41 deputies in the House of Representatives and 35 of them were present at the vote.</seg>
<seg id="1369">All members agreed to vote have voted for the law.</seg>
<seg id="1370">The pediatrician is no longer permitted in Trinidad and Tobago.</seg>
<seg id="1371">It was a long fight (...)</seg>

<seg id="1375">But a possible hook comes in the form of Sat Maharaj, the Secretary General of the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, the most famous Hindu organisation in the country.</seg>
<seg id="1376">A few months before Maharaj announced his intention to take legal action, the law was to be passed, and he seems to deliver his promise.</seg>
<seg id="1377">During the General Attorney General, Paris Al rawi, an advocate of the law, said it was quite legitimate if Maharaj wanted to go against the law, most social media users would like to address the debate on the subject differently.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worrell proposed:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Dear sat, instead of holding the discussion so general, in a way that can only evoke panic and disgrace, instead of talking about the problem that we are abusing the state in our bedrooms, "would you be ready to continue the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you think that this is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">But whether it comes to a court action against the law or not, this legislation is an important step - but there are still places in the world where children are legal or still the norm, even though there are laws that they prohibit.</seg>

<seg id="1390">By mirroring web pages Turkish users can view Wikipedia content again</seg>
<seg id="1391">The Wikipedia page was published on 18 January 2012, contrary to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright legislation in the USA, internationally obscured.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For more than a month, Turkey has been blocking the popular and crowdsourcing principle based on encyclopedia Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day by day it becomes clearer how important the platform for users is to find and share helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series fight against the blockade.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many technicite Internet users are used to using bypassing tools for blocked web pages (a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence in the world), most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey since 2008 locked Article from Wikipedia, as recently described in a published report by Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blockages of the Internet have been held since 2007 after the Internet Law (No. 5651) was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">After China, Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform remains locked, there are now several mirrors (pages that mirror the content of Wikipedia and are often updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">One solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform put all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (i.e. computer calculator), which is not based on the system of domain names and therefore makes a complete censorship quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is, in spite of legal prohibition, can be called upon.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post, IPFS reports about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">Once we've heard the news (about the locking of Wikipedia), we put everything on taking snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. thus, there is the possibility to read the content in distributed and distributed fashion.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to at least view all Wikipedia content even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also stated that this step was done independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is merely screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni from Wikimedia Italy has brought both tr.vikiansicyclopedi.org, a mirror site from Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mirrors when locked in the respective country Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices Member and employees at Mozilla in the Panigrahi's Open Speaks "Podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy address, a mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">You access another URL that is not the original. that what you see is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">In essence, the server directs the request to the correct Wikipedia page so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia, even if they are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">For this is done by a server not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1414">A suhlenght Rhino, Chitwan.</seg>
<seg id="1415">Photo by Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were blurry with badly positioned motifs and washed colours.</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to carry a camera with him and try to straighten the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">Back then he was a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring Nepal wildlife to the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his home location next to Chitwan National Park offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw attention to Nepal's wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this first-class location helps him:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live on the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested at home when I suddenly called in Navarre (the manager of Chitwan Gaida). he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rapti river a leopard would be.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The dam is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father had watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river, where the leopard was and I immediately began to kneel pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar strives to cooperate with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Neptune's nature and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as frightening as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he ought to know [it], for he had already face to face to tigers face to face,</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger can't disturb the mind of the sheep during sleep!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late at night. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also I was on the way home because of the darkness, when suddenly the king of the busiest appeared. he sets out immediately, we look at us and he stares me through the Sal trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals Sagar places the logo "I click for conservation" (ite.: I click for environmental protection) on its photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">However, his passion for the promotion of Nepal and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days, mostly living in a tent to shoot at the Bardia National Park recordings from Ottern. up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodations.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This post was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and was originally published on Video Volunteers, an award-winning international community media organization from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version has been re-published as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, women avoid addressing the names of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead they use a pronouns or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women admit that they respect the husband because of social pressure, as well as fear of the consequences they should disregard the norm.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto was condemned from the Indian state of Odisha by a pseudo court and rejected by her family and the village community after she had addressed a married family with her name.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of naming their wives also is common among men. however, they have far fewer rights to fear if at all they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the Pune district, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health staff and housewives, joined a unique club and became the main topic of the city's main topic.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone, where they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states, he is part of the # KhelBadal campaign run by the Community Video Volunteers and campaigning for the exploitation of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">For seven years Rohini Pawas has been working with the help of their video camera to discover practices such as children's marriage, HIV and AIDS patients, and leads these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">She tells us how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambassadors for change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video, which Rohini showed in her discussion, was about women who don't call their husbands by name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this topic because she wanted to open the conversation about the patriarchy with a problem with which women can easily identify.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Not to pronounce the name of their husbands loudly, is a custom that they all uphold and never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Raw ini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not consider this is regarded as deceitful, as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning Rohini, who had never called her husband, wanted to try out at home as it runs.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini recounts:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video ended.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said I should call him by his name from now on.</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this confidence in the luggage, Rohini started their first discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "patriarchy" before. some believed it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked each participant to tell her husband's name with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">"" "then she asked," "" "If we cannot tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us what they want, does it mean they don't respect us?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1499">"" "should it not be equivalent?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their husbands over their lips," says Rohini Pawas from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra about breaking a centuries-old tradition in which married women can never speak the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini recounts:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so intimidated that during the whole exercise she was chasing herself; another decided to release the whole pent-up frustration towards him and his family by escaping him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I'll never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Even in the rush of adrenaline about having broken with an ancient tradition, the women decided that they would actually try to call their husbands by name.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days Rohini received a large number of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put the women upside down: his wife could not stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it at dinner in front of the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law stared her, she got scared and said that it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">"" "another woman said," "" "Routes thought I should do it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation was in force.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women tried to stop other practices such as wearing the carcinnoberred dot on the forehead that shows the spital status:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women only need to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"" "" "" "I said to my husband that I would bear the zinerred dot if he did." ""</seg>
<seg id="1516">He only laughed and I stopped carrying him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not completely stopped doing so, but think they are in a better position to choose themselves, not to wear it on some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "" "" "we make an excursion with each discussion club." ""</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "I don't want women to worry about who could hear what," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last few months they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes for the first time in their lives; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Raw ini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never spoken so honestly about some things, for example, how our identities are tied to our husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to be able to say certain things, no matter how small they are.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion, we talked about the concept of honour and how it is connected to clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have been wearing saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most it's okay, but some wanted to wear a saline kurt, a wide shirt over a trousers; they didn't dare.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After many arguments and discussions about the advantages of their own dress code, morals linked to the saris and much more, Rohini smuggled their own pair of Kurtas (upper shirts) into a discussion round, so that women could wear them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next they decided to plan a trip to Goa where they can wear jeans and Rohini are sure they'll manage it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question of whether something has changed in the five months since their first discussion club, Rohini confirmed that things are slowly rolling out:</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have only made small steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times, but then stopped to say the name of her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, still do it, but only if they are alone and not with other family members.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now wear vermilion on their foreheads.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the viola for more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothes - lie at the end of a difficult-to-navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they become aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">As explained in Rohini:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am also.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1548">Screenshot from the official YouTube channel of the Beatles.</seg>
<seg id="1549">On June 29th of this year, the hashtag was to be found in the Japanese Twitter trend, where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beatles.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The visit of the Beatles in 1966 in Japan is regarded as a turning point in the Japanese culture of the post-war period.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The first Japanese journalist, Hoshika Rumiko, who was exclusively interviewed by the Beatles in London in 1964, noticed in 2016 on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of his first visit:</seg>
<seg id="1552">For just under five days the Beatles were in the country, but this was enough to let the Japanese go through.</seg>
<seg id="1553">People here have quite quickly realized that they had no choice but to receive the Beatles with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Many known Japanese sizes had reached its zenith when the Beatles came to Japan for the first time in 1966.</seg>
<seg id="1555">"" "the music of the cult band is" "" "more than just a universal language like English," "" "said Ryuichi Isaka, president of the retailer Seven & amp; i Holdings, the Nikkei Asian Review online magazine." ""</seg>
<seg id="1556">Good morning! for today, the Beatles Memorial Day is in Japan. for the first 51 years ago, they were here in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="1557">Even today, songs from the Beatles are sung in Japanese karaoke bars and in English classes at Japanese center schools.</seg>
<seg id="1558">The Beatles kitsch survived all this.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Today is Beatles commemoration day.</seg>
<seg id="1560">We all love The Beatles in our house.</seg>
<seg id="1561">I don't know if this "Winnie the Pooh" doll is supposed to be John Lennon or not.</seg>
<seg id="1562">And as it is for fans, Japanese make pilgrimages to the familiar places that are connected with the band.</seg>
<seg id="1563">If you love the Beatles, these are your 5 places that you absolutely must visit.</seg>

<seg id="1571">Today is Beatles commemoration day.</seg>
<seg id="1572">Right now in 1966, the Beatles came to Japan for the first time.</seg>

<seg id="1574">The same we did last year.</seg>
<seg id="1575">And of course some companies make use of the fan community in terms of market terms, such as this Ramen shop (Ramen are Japanese noodles) in Tokyo.</seg>

<seg id="1583">The Zambézia police warned the population that bald men could be aiming for attacks in Mozambique.</seg>
<seg id="1584">Photo: Anders Bolin / Flickr, CC-BY-NC 2.0</seg>
<seg id="1585">A new system of kidnapping of bald persons for organ trafficking, probably for superstitious purposes, concerns the police of Zambézia, a province in Mozambique. the local government now called a number of operations to stop the practice.</seg>
<seg id="1586">At the beginning of the month, three men were killed in the district of Milange, a few kilometers from the shore of Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1587">One of the victims was decapitated and part of the organs had been taken.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Two men were arrested and subsequently led to the use of the organs of shamans in Tanzania and Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1589">There is the local superstition that the head of a bald man could contain gold or bring wealth, the Zambézia police spokesman explained.</seg>
<seg id="1590">It is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique.</seg>

<seg id="1592">This led to the fact that the UN 2016 carried out a mission in the South African country to investigate this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The persecution of people with albinism is common in other countries of Southern Africa, especially in neighbouring Tanzania, where the government developed campaigns to fight this superstition and prejudice.</seg>

<seg id="1600">The persecution and murder of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Morąbala, Province of Zambézia, has cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional shamans, which also indicates that a faith exists, according to which the victims in the head might have power to generate the riches.</seg>

<seg id="1626">A photo by Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia, probably just recently made.</seg>
<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on 8 July 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of the imprisoned Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo has attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he was hospitalized due to liver cancer at the end stage.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years "imprisonment for" Subversion, "after he participated in the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto calling for democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China described Lius case as "an internal affair" and told a spokesman that he considered it "not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country."</seg>
<seg id="1633">Nevertheless, China continues to receive calls from the international community, the Nobel laureate and his wife, poet Liu Xia, or to permit treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries have criticised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing, others have completely wiped out the issue.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summarised some of the reactions abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United Nations According to United Nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">However, a spokesman refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exert pressure to allow Liu to be treated abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway from Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister Børge Brende refused to answer questions about Liu's release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway was stalled after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu in 2010, although the Norwegian government announced that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were only resumed in December last year. only in June, Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon exports to China, because exports have been largely blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed hope for unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Due to his imprisonment, he was unable to accept his prize.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony, Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union - European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to immediately release Liu and his wife from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The top diplomat of the EU, Federica Mogherini, also called on China to release Lius, as announced in a statement on 30 June:</seg>
<seg id="1649">At the same time, we expect China to abolish all restrictions of Mr. Lius wife and family members.</seg>
<seg id="1650">They should meet and receive all the visits they desire and be able to communicate freely with the outside world.</seg>
<seg id="1651">United States of America</seg>
<seg id="1652">Us ambassador Terry Branstad told us that the Americans "wish him that he has the possibility of treatment abroad, in so far as it can help him in his recovery."</seg>
<seg id="1653">A spokeswoman for the U.S. embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, announced the AFP news agency on 27 June that the embassy asked the Chinese authorities not only to release Liu but also to free his wife Liu Xia from house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "the US embassy request drew a furious response from China, with the statement of the State Department that" "" "no country has the right to interfere and make irresponsible remarks about Chinese internal affairs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley told that China should offer the couple the following:</seg>
<seg id="1656">Protection and freedom, such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of his choice, to which they claim according to the Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international obligations.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The US senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz have also adopted a decision in Congress to urge the Chinese government to release Liu and his wife unconditionally.</seg>
<seg id="1658">I urge China to release the Nobel laureate # LiuXiaobo unconditionally so that he can embark on a proper medical treatment. http: / / bit.ly / 2tE6kUo</seg>
<seg id="1659">Germany Please contact us</seg>
<seg id="1660">The German government spokesperson, Steffen Seibert, wrote on July 3, Berlin hopes that Liu will receive all the medical support he needs and that a "humanitarian solution for Liu Xiaobo should be the highest priority."</seg>
<seg id="1661">The Chinese President Xi Jinping appeared on 7 and 8 July at the G20 summit in Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1662">Previously, diplomatic sources reported in Peking from the news agency Reuters that China had big concerns about whether the vortex of Liu could overshadow the visit to Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada - Canada</seg>
<seg id="1664">On 28 June, Canadian Ambassador John McCallum asked China to provide Liu with appropriate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Liu lawyer told AFP previously that Liu's wife, Liu Xia, could visit him every day, but the police always monitored the room in the hospital and that Liu is not allowed to talk to someone outside, including his lawyers, to speak and contact.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum further talks:</seg>
<seg id="1667">Canada calls on China to uphold its international human rights obligations, including freedom of expression, and to release the freedom to exercise these rights.</seg>
<seg id="1668">France and France</seg>
<seg id="1669">France's Foreign Ministry asked China to release Liu on humanitarian grounds in a declaration on 29 June:</seg>
<seg id="1670">All necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo receives all the treatments he needs, regardless of where. furthermore, his wife and his family should have contact with him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news channel France Info has already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there is no further information about whether France would eventually receive it.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Taiwan Holiday with dog</seg>
<seg id="1673">The Council of Rural Affairs in Taiwan demanded China on 27 June release Liu and show a greater tolerance towards those seeking peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Taiwanese legislature, Yu Mei-nu, from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, also called on China to allow the sick intellectual Liu to be treated in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual leader in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, expressed himself very much in an explanation on June 28 around Liu and admitted that many have asked him to pray for Lius well-being.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my belief that the initiatives he took and for whom he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious, more stable and prosperous China, which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I personally felt very moved and also encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, signed the Charter 08 which stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognized as an independent state on an international level.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has sparked a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the State of New York, the Minister stressed that many people criticised the dominance of the only political party in Singapore because it compared Singapore to other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supports Singapore to be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one asked if New York was a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is what most people make a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"" "the Cavalierio blog accused the Minister of Justice to" "" "twist the logic" "" "to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore." ""</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land, we hear that ultimately we are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities, a breach of duty.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you're not my country, whose land is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons cited by Shanmugam were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in view of it, it seemed inevitably undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">On the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently led by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">As soon as one reaches the core of the subject, the good old lyre pops up from the authoritarian rulers who pretend to be democrats, leave the twisted logic, since it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end the last week of Shanmugam was given answers to his American guests regarding our press, our judiciary, and our political system really non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1703">He objected to relevant questions in a rational manner with non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng requests Shanmugam to clarify his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Personally, I find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">When Singapore is not a country, but a city, so to which country belongs our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmugam would take the trouble to clear this point, if he was paid high to be part of the government of the City of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By publishing his commentary on the blog, he points out to the critics that one should start reading the whole transcript of the conference so that one can better understand the context of Shanmugam, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said that Singapore is more of a" "" "city" "", "he explained why the elections in Singapore are so unequal, even if we enjoy free and just choices." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "when he said that" "" "Singapore" "" "is not a country," "" "he obviously did not mean it in this sense!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, who as the leader of a growing generation, makes such a polemical statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore had said...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old Guard I expected - I agree or not, but this is another matter.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes this, properly associates and is aware of what he is defending.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review debits the weak points of Shanmugams's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"" "did Mr Shanmugam have" "" "good faith a mistake" "" "or was it a Freudian-spokesman?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is not a country, we are only considered an independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, on which country are the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally country and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">As he plays an important role within the Cabinet, the statements of Mr. Shanmugam are of serious importance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do the people of Singapore afford their military service, but do they not defend their city but their country?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who must pay our prime minister bills?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink identity card?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">The magazine Journey of a Decade is tending to affirm, Singapore is and has always been a city:</seg>
<seg id="1729">"" "" "" "I didn't say what I said..." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1730">This sentence seems to have annoyed many Singaporeans...</seg>
<seg id="1731">Nobody ever said Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We have always been a city / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"" "I can understand that we often hear statements like" "" "the defense of the country" "", "but this is not quite correct." ""</seg>
<seg id="1735">We should rather speak of the defence of the city.</seg>

<seg id="1739">Global Voices wondered recently: what is the most misunderstood aspect of your home or home country?</seg>
<seg id="1740">Your answers will be published here as part of a continuing series, with which rumors about certain parts of the world are revealed and another facet is to be shown.</seg>
<seg id="1741">The latest part of this series is written by Nevin Thompson, editor for Global Voices Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1742">The question most asked me in Japan is: "are you Americans?"</seg>
<seg id="1743">"" "" "" "no, sorry," "" "I answer." "" "I'm from Canada." "" "since 1994 I live in Japan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1744">Depending on the situation in which the conversation takes place, it is considered polite to show interest in the conversation partner by asking personal questions.</seg>
<seg id="1745">"Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice hockey, nature." many Canadians maybe cook inside anger when they are thought for Americans but I don't mind that.</seg>
<seg id="1746">For someone who does not know himself, there is little that is different to us Canadians of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians get a Canadian flag visible on their rucksack when they travel.</seg>
<seg id="1748">All dear Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1749">Americans, on the other hand....</seg>
<seg id="1750">So it was already when I started to travel around the world 20 years ago - before Donald Trump, before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11.</seg>
<seg id="1751">Canadians have always carried little maple leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="1752">We have a free healthcare system!</seg>
<seg id="1753">There are no weapons with us!</seg>
<seg id="1754">Same-sex marriages have been legal in Canada since 2005!</seg>
<seg id="1755">All seem to think Canada is so great.</seg>
<seg id="1756">We are polite.</seg>
<seg id="1757">"" "we obviously say very often" "" "sorry." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1758">Canada is said to be the most tolerant country towards ethnic groups.</seg>
<seg id="1759">We are not like these guys south of the border.</seg>
<seg id="1760">We Canadians are nice.</seg>
<seg id="1761">I hate that.</seg>
<seg id="1762">First, I have many American friends I admire very much.</seg>
<seg id="1763">I wouldn't mind if you were confused with Johnny from Dallas for example.</seg>
<seg id="1764">With Marc from Austin.</seg>
<seg id="1765">With Adam from San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Or with Michael from Honolulu.</seg>
<seg id="1767">But there are also some problems with the stamp "nice."</seg>
<seg id="1768">First, to be called "nice" means to be idle, like the benign, gentle but tragically insignificant figure Ned Flanders from "Die Simpsons" (who has a Canadian Doppelgänger).</seg>
<seg id="1769">If Canada was really a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, this would indeed be a step forward. but the real problem is that "nice" has no personality.</seg>
<seg id="1770">There are no corners and edges, nothing you can encounter.</seg>
<seg id="1771">Being harmless means being unobtrusive and uninteresting and not paying attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">This can be a good thing if you want to stay unnoticed in the background, away from things that happen around you.</seg>
<seg id="1773">I would even go to say that the desire to be free and alone is a major part of the Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to take care of our own affairs.</seg>
<seg id="1775">"" "what outsiders call" "" "nice" "" "may be simply a cool courtesy." ""</seg>
<seg id="1776">Canadians often talk about the fence across the fence.</seg>
<seg id="1777">We lack the warm, open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends.</seg>
<seg id="1778">Luckily for us (and for the rest of the world) Justin Trudeau entered the stage to show that Canadians are more than just "nice." our prime minister has made Canada sexy.</seg>
<seg id="1779">Music video of a pop band parodies Thailand's junta</seg>
<seg id="1780">A pop band, famous in Thailand, has released a music video that parodies the junta, which in 2014 took power and, despite its promise to restore the civilian government, continues to rule the country.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The new song "Dictator Girl" (Phadet Girl) of the Band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells of what precepts his girlfriend makes.</seg>
<seg id="1782">Although not explicitly political, the music video still refers indirectly to the continued military rule of the Junta.</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country's situation.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The video to the song was a huge success.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Within the first three days, the video uploaded to Facebook was 1,254 times shared and received 8,800 kes.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Last month even the Charlie Chaplin video "The Dictator" in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists invited the public to watch this video.</seg>
<seg id="1787">The video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, particularly in relation to the situation of the country under the Junta rule.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Take a look at these videos, which refer to some of the political issues that Thailand has persistently pursued over the past three years.</seg>
<seg id="1789">The "44 Rules of the Girls" may refer to the draconian section 44 of the provisional constitution granting absolute decision making on important national issues to the commander-in-chief of the army.</seg>
<seg id="1790">"" "the 11th rule:" "" "change your attitude" "" "refers to the notorious programme of" "" "change of imagination" "" "by journalists, students, scientists, activists, politicians and other people who are considered critics of the Junta." ""</seg>
<seg id="1791">The picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime, whose vague and unclear rules are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state.</seg>
<seg id="1792">For this purpose, a new unit was set up in the army to monitor online content and to prosecute persons accused of having slandered the monarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1793">Thailand uses a strict regime against "Lese Majeste" (Majority offense).</seg>
<seg id="1794">On 20 May 2014, martial law was declared in Thailand.</seg>
<seg id="1795">Two days later it came to a coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="1796">One of the problems the Junta continues to pursue is its decision to buy expensive submarines, although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money.</seg>
<seg id="1797">In the video it is even shown how people are thrown into a black van, before putting them into an internment camp, another problem.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Some journalists are in prison because they allegedly created "confusion" in society and Internet users are threatened with long prison sentences, they should offend the monarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1799">Meanwhile, the teaser of the song showed members of the band who imitated the Salute from "The Hunger Games," which was already used by putsch opponents during the protests in 2014.</seg>

<seg id="1804">The postwar society recovers only very slowly in East-East-Asia, especially in the district Tkuarchal.</seg>
<seg id="1805">Over 20 years have passed since the Georgian-Abchassic war has been officially ended, but its scars are still visible in this part of the republic.</seg>
<seg id="1806">The abandoned villages of the northern district in Tkuarchal show striking images.</seg>
<seg id="1807">Villages such as Dzhantukha, Akarmara, Pyataya Shakhta, Polyana and Kharchili are located in the hydromassage of Abkhazia.</seg>
<seg id="1808">Various ethnic groups such as Russians, Greeks, Abahazia, Georgians and Armenians lived and worked together on Soviet sites in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1809">Many of them had to leave their homes during the war.</seg>
<seg id="1810">Today, the biggest part of the Russians and the Abchasen live in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Such settlements are also called ghost towns in Abkhazia.</seg>
<seg id="1812">During the pre-war period more than 10,000 people lived here, today there are only a few hundred people in these ghosts.</seg>
<seg id="1813">This phenomenon is characteristic for Tkuarchal.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Since 2011, the total population of the district amounted to 16,000 people, having hardly increased over a decade.</seg>
<seg id="1815">In 1989 about 43.000 people lived in this district.</seg>

<seg id="1895">Concepción González Ramírez directs a small hotel in Tapachula, in the state of Chiapas, at the border of Mexico to Guatemala.</seg>

<seg id="1897">This article by Amy Bracken was published on April 19, 2017 on the website of our partner PRI.org and appears here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="1898">On the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America, certain places for their hospitality will be known.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, located at the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is led by a 59- year-old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral-pink frame and golden earrings in teddy bears.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many under the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is owed to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) became a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about $2.50 per night guests sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and metal beds.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the vestibule there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - yet hundreds of African and Haitian migrants come here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Ms Ramírez narrates, the people come to full small busses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to call: "Mama Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you from Mama Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the moment it is rather quiet, but this year, Ramírez has already received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have already slept on boxes outside.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to reject anybody.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and brings them to the hospital if they are ill, they buy drugs that they can't pay, they massage them with a balm the feet exhausted by the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychque Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived recently.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa was an appropriate nickname for Ms Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The Sebastiao family (with their daughter Merrui, who has a yoghurche) posing with Concepción González Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Photo: Amy Bracken.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"" "" "" "yes, yes," "" "he answers with a smile." "" "I really feel it suits her, because African women are very nice women." ""</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They have already lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move northwards.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa. "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the route," explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He says that the Haitians and the Africans are often traveling together and that the Africans are already talking about Whatsapp by Ms Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Like many of his companions, Michelet has lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker for construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy became weaker, it began its journey to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been guest with Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I wonder if he will have contact with Mrs Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again," he answers with a smile. "we will always stay in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Ms. Ramírez says that their guests often send text messages when they have gone to greet them or to report about the course of their trip.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that their Christian faith is the driving force of their work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken as in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Mrs Ramírez is perhaps very well known here, but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city leads a cul de sac to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter Valenzuela and his family immigrated to their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African immigrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He has begun to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered them his home for a dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment there are 25 persons, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a kitchen area outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"" "" "" "I lived in the United States," "" "he says." "" "I experienced what they are experiencing." ""</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border across the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others do not help. that's why I give them my support. "</seg>
<seg id="1946">After living for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants traveling through Tapachula comes from Central America, other residents also open doors to their homes for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he has fled to Honduras with his wife and three children from people who wanted to blackmail him without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown person, a single educator, offered him a roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later the family still lives there and tries to decide where the next step is to go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Afrika everything is full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the corridors, travelers consult their phones calmly.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, a large part of Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Mrs Ramírez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic because of those who have gone away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother she leaves in her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one of her daughter with African hair plays she has made a female client, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old.</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sadly, while she introduces her to me.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Ya se fueron, repeats it every time. "you have gone."</seg>
<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang residents are forced to install a monitoring app on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">A check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjang from Twitter users.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minorities area in western China, are forced to install a spyware on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On July 10, the mobile phone users in the Tianshan district of Urumqi received a mobile notification in which they instruct the district government to install a monitoring app called Jingwang (or "Web Clean").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "in the announcement, it is said that the app" "" "prevents access to terrorist information" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">However, the authorities applauded the app for more than fighting terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report from Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture because, shortly after they had installed the app, they had exchanged news with a private chat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">"" "the police said that the app would identify and prosecute the sources and distribution channels of terrorists, along with" "" "illegal religious" "" "activities and" "" "harmful information" "" "including videos, images, eBooks and documents." ""</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwang's website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main feature is blocking pornographic websites, from online scams, trojans, and phishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online, and to remotely control their home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with the minors' filters will help children to develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate the home network of a person or steal it from it.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While messages about digital censorship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south, reality is very often gloomy for those living in remote, repressed ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">To limit unrest and discontent in conflict areas, the authorities often arrange extreme censors and surveillance measures as well as routine internet abstentions.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The media outlet "Images from mainland China" (previously published on Twitter), the censored news in China, showed photos of a checkpoint where police inspectors checked indiscriminately whether they had installed the monitoring app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure that people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile alert demanded that people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are discovered on a checkpoint with a device without this software, you might be imprisoned for up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced people to use devices intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity by the rest-growth technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from mainland China" also published a Jingwang product description, from which the software can lift the password demand of a Windows operating system and thus get unlimited access to the hard drive of the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After the installation of Jingwang, computers and mobile phones in Xinjiang become electronic cuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The Jingwang rules may be a response to the instructions given by the City Council to minimise the dissemination of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government branches, authorities and institutions affiliated with the party, including universities and research institutions, are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office during operation of their computers and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A recent Freedom House report, an American human rights organisation, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang, on June 27, in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi, the authorities issued an ordinance with the directive to all residents and entrepreneurs, until 1 August register their "personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks, and media memory cards" at the local police.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously to identify and destroy any "terrorist" videos. however, this action violates the personality rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants and gives them penalties for a whole series of possible offenses, including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages.</seg>

<seg id="2071">At my first arrest, I asked myself whether the investigator had previously worked as a waste collector or whether it belonged to the normal work equipment.</seg>
<seg id="2072">They had intertwined four cables in order to present us the great invention of a huge cable from their point of view.</seg>
<seg id="2073">Within a single hour, three of them alternated while I was still in turn.</seg>
<seg id="2074">I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice, which is why I stopped screaming.</seg>
<seg id="2075">The executioner noticed the cooling down and didn't really like it, which is why he picked up an electrically charged stick.</seg>
<seg id="2076">Electricity flowed all my body, enough to supply my whole area.</seg>
<seg id="2077">My half naked body stretched out to the ground was the perfect conductor.</seg>
<seg id="2078">The numbness disappeared and the pain was there again.</seg>
<seg id="2079">After two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night.</seg>
<seg id="2080">It must have been around midnight.</seg>
<seg id="2081">I decided to sleep again; let's say that was my only option.</seg>
<seg id="2082">A few hours passed that came to me like minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Then the call to the morning prayer.</seg>
<seg id="2084">The door opens and the morning light fills the room. "Raus with you, Arschfucker."</seg>
<seg id="2085">"" "I answer with the voice of an exhausted young man:" "" "my Lord, my Father must be fearful." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2086">"" "" "" "be quiet and walk away, you will be laid." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2087">That was new.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Otherwise they had always left me free.</seg>
<seg id="2089">Where do they lead me?!</seg>
<seg id="2090">The Jordanian rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of the LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and opposition</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib spends most of his time inside; sometimes he locks to his screen, sometimes to his computer, back and again to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his nicotine quaked lip.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the highest floor of his family house, which has belonged to them since 1967; the year when Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and Hdaibs's family was forced to escape from their village in Palestine, where they lived as fellows (e.g.: farmers).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years now Hdaib has been a passionate activist who faces the conservative majority and questioned their well-established opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rape.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often deals with topics such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world. all these topics are not only relevant in his home town of Amman, but also in cities that range from Damascus in Syria to Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With his 25 years, Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not limited by boundaries in his thinking and can feel with people who suffer from the disastrous consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he does not openly admit it, he hates a special aversion to the US foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones, have anything to do with his identity as "Palestinian refugees of the second generation," he describes himself even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"" "" "" "I don't think so because of my own circumstances," "" "said Hdaib." ""</seg>
<seg id="2104">"" "then he adds:" "" "I think so because I am a man," "" "while he shakes in water dissolved Nescafé into two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan; at this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset." ""</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the consumption of food during the Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee on a scorching hot young day has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically the pieces of lukewarm coffee and the cheers of the Kent-cigarette in the nose speak primarily of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky, especially when you take a look at the neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Hence, it is easy to avoid basic things - as drinking in the public during the Ramadan Water - in order not to land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the Interior Ministry announced a performance by the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some MPs who support the Islamic Front of Action - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual frontsman Hamed Seno, contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the concert.</seg>
<seg id="2112">"" "the Euro MPs and former press spokesperson for the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert had been cancelled" "" "just" "" "because of the sexual orientation of the singer." ""</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many argue that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which demands the proven legitimacy of authoritarian regimes across the region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila estimated the Jordanian people as "progressive supporters of human rights," who continue to choose "for intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement might not simply be shallow rhetoric, but actually reflect an increasingly clear-crystallizing reality in Jordan, which appears clearly in Hdaibs's work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib returned to traditional gender standards by forming his vision of the fate of Arab women who have premarital sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of an unknown woman, whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red sea; perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In recent years, the number of "honorary morals" has increased in Jordan - the unofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch, the number of honorary morals reached its peak in 2016; however, it is still appalling that Jordan is lacking the institutional infrastructure to support the women who have attempted murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law to fight crime from 1954, women who are exposed to the risk of intra-family violence can "be held in prison indefinitely," and for their release it is often necessary to have years of bureaucratic expenditure and the family's guarantee that nothing will happen to the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Even Hdaib's music enjoys great popularity and is known to not shy away from issues that were long considered taboo in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denied that his work is political, but admits that he cannot separate his music, which is full of explicit references to sexuality, freedom and expression.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"" "" "" "I come from the Middle East, man." ""</seg>
<seg id="2125">"" "politics has been given to me," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2126">"" "in a song called" "" "Edward Sa'ed" "", "Hdaib tackled the question of Palestinian identity." ""</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and in "Ghareeb" the focus is on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political in the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016, Hdaib released a song titled "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song one verse frequently repeats itself:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"" "" "" "you are free, and everyone else is it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the further course of the song, Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market in which one, in his words, "can get what you want" - be it faith or non-faith, hetero- or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notes that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay men and lesbians and that comments on gender equality between LGBTQ + individuals have been censored until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular Jordanian online program Roya, in order to later memorize that his comments were torn out of context, distorted and in his opinion censored.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"" "" "" "on Youtube, it was uploaded without cuts, but only a edited version," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib is campaigning openly for the Arab LGBTQ + community and believes intolerance does not correspond to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century, still remembered today thanks to his homoerotic poetry.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks himself: if Abu Nuwhat, who was supposed to work on behalf of the caliph, was able to write openly about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanians not?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was canceled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the Hashemite Kingdom there is nothing new that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Service held several former government officials and members of the teacher association, arguing that in social media comments, they were critical of the problems related to the corruption rooted in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, Hdaib's opinion is only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him progress is a constant giving and taking. Jordan did not defy Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - this is Hdaib - consists of slow, thoughtful and internal changes. he is sure that these changes take place every day in the heart of the Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">In the end Hdaib dreams, like millions of other Arabs, from an Arab world without any intervention from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">"" "he is not only dreaming of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of" "" "experiencing them" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will be approached by music, art and literature of a genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, cluster munitions and artificially-made democracies. at least he hopes this.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until it is ready, Hdaib will continue to rap and therefore resist.</seg>
<seg id="2148">This report was made possible by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, which Aman belongs as a student Fellow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These big, extravagant wardolls are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebuta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">One assumes that it is a variant of the Tanabata festival, which is usually also celebrated in many areas of Tohokus in August. another theory states that the floats, drums and dancing have been handed over more than one thousand years ago, in the armies of the west Japan marched into the Northeast to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the emisshi, to knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebula Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We were able to grab some great seats, so we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">One can only imagine how large these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A community centre in the capital city, Meguro Gajoen, organized a two-month exhibition on Wa no Akari (wörth.</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been looking at Meguro Gajoen for a long time: two fixed cars are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend his summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>
<seg id="2160">Yattemare! "# Summer festival in the north of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2161">I was there and looked at the # NebuchaFestival.</seg>
<seg id="2162">The sight of a 18 meter high car was incredible.</seg>
<seg id="2163">Let us enjoy the rest of the summer!</seg>

<seg id="2167">External appearance and body care were rarely as important as in this history because they help keep the Peruvian youth out of crime and promote a legitimate profession like that of the hairdresser.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historic center of Lima, a region with a very high crime rate, where street raub and illegal drug trade are omnipresent.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time, Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - experienced an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend to copy the appearance and thus also the unusual hairstyles of famous sportsmen such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil) has led to becoming more and more normal citizens into the experienced hands of hairdressers who can recreate these complex hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles, which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the competition of the hairdressers "Batalla de Barberos," which has been taking place since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">There experts compete against each other to show who can create the most eccentric looks, as you can see in the following video (more videos to current contests are available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as the Augusto Salazar Bondy School, located in El Callao, found an opportunity to persuade young people to swap their weapons against hairdressing tools and receive training in the art of hairdressing, which enables them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and the possibilities offered, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Before the school year beginning in March, the school offered special training workshops and reported some of their successes:</seg>
<seg id="2177">In 1995, we were the only school in the community and the district, which we are very proud of because of love for the children we have built this educational community.</seg>
<seg id="2178">Colombia: love letters to guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>

<seg id="2181">"" "the following article is the edited version of the contribution" "" "Love messages to guerilla fighters" "", "published by the international online magazine Tea After Twelve." ""</seg>
<seg id="2182">The contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not even more important to accommodate people who feel expelled, affection?</seg>
<seg id="2185">Exactly this question left the young Columbian activist Leonardo Párraga not anymore from the BogotArt Foundation and Cristian Palacios by the Young-Youth Foundation and inspired them to write letters to the campaign Cartas por la Reconciliación (Letters to Reconciliation), encouraging young people to write letters to guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only recently, their country was the scene of a historic event, and they wanted to contribute to it: after years of negotiations the Colombian government had signed a peace treaty with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia), which forms the end of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">Internationally, the signing of the Peace Treaty was so important that Colombian President José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">However, in front of the Colombians there is a long way to talk about true reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla fighters, who have lived in illegal camps for many years, were subjected to war rhetoric and carried their weapons around the clock, must now be integrated into life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society, which has become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred of guerrilla fighters, must now take these into their ranks and support them in building a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombians would join together and help the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: up to now thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guerilla fighters to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerrilla fighter - who will then be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the Letters to Reconciliation was created at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk briefly with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love on Valentine's Day, but those who need them much more.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plans to share his love with people that needed most urgent attention this year.</seg>
<seg id="2198">The plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former FARC fighters who now find their place in society and build up a new life. "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history a common history of peace," she says.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Up to now more than 2,000 letters were collected within the framework of the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities in Colombia, such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i never thought someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Caldono-Cauca region on 19 March.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city administration of Cali and Leonardo from the BogotArt Foundation traveled to the camp to personally transfer the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC arose as they had done earlier in order to accept the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they received no orders, but letters full of support from people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for everyone involved. "it's incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and all that lies in between" told the political scientist Manuela Jiménez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a member of the governor of the province of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After passing the letters, a former warrior led me through the camp of guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I looked into one of the "Cambches" (a kind of hut in which the guerrillas live) I saw a guerrilla fighter who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go in, because next to him lay a MGL garnet, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "I asked him anyway and asked," "" "Hello, what are they doing?" "" "he said," "" "I answer a letter that someone wrote to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"" "never in my life someone wrote something so beautiful, so I answer it." "" "suddenly my tears ran over the cheeks." ""</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him completely and sat down beside the garnet.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was sorry for the war, it was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this warrior, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he had never expected anything else from life than war. joining the FARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers before Hungertod. "I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society outside, waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now I have only learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">But now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity. "</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices and voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">At the beginning students and some of the FARC leaders met for a discussion.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war and the FARC were already in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">This is why the leaders of the FARC stated the history of the organisation, its ideals, and gave insight into their views on the peace process: "for many years we have experienced how social injustice on the part of the state looked upon the entire Colombian people. now that we have the opportunity to develop ourselves into a political party, we can help make society more just in this country.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "a goal of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles," "" "said one of them." ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">To hear those people who have never found a hearing and had no right to vote, and to realize that the people I have often seen as monsters, and even hate people with beautiful feelings, which were turned around through their living circumstances and their environment, was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives, hurts me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and have done so much harm, can teach us something and give a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo González, the camp's commander in Caldono-Cauca, wrote the following letter to the Archbishop of Cali, the Archbishop of Cali:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombians were made aware that peace would reign after disarmament.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as there is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people willing to resort to arms, raise up and protest for their rights. and that is also completely justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">"" "" "" "we of the FARC now rely on peace, on a policy without weapons." ""</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call all defenders of peace - whatever race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices, for we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. for those of us who defend life as the basis of existence, many difficulties will be imminent.</seg>
<seg id="2237">There will be many obstacles on our way, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2243">Homosexual and queer people living in the Caucasus region are exposed to a wide range of dangers including discrimination, physical and sexual violence and blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="2244">With terror, activists have witnessed the reporting of the last months on the persecution of gay men in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2245">But the threat posed as a sword of Damocles on the local LGBTQ community has not come into existence only overnight.</seg>
<seg id="2246">OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a transsexual woman from Grozny who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is happening in the republic.</seg>
<seg id="2247">Several months ago, the LGBTQ legal situation in Chechnya has won international headlines after reports have been published that address the deportation, torture and killing of queer men in the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="2248">The first report was published by journalist Elena Milaschina in the Nowaya Gazeta; she threw a light on the methods of Chechen authorities who arrested suspicious queer men and put them into secret prisons in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"you have brought a monster to the world"</seg>
<seg id="2250">Sabrina, a Transwoman, was born in Grozny and grew up there.</seg>
<seg id="2251">Since her childhood she felt that she was actually a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2252">When she grew up, she became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for her, why she moved to Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="2253">After a group of Chechens experienced the gender equality of their landlady, the hunt for Sabrina was opened.</seg>
<seg id="2254">She moved out of fear about her life in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I worked as a volunteer in a human rights organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day I was told that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">It was a friend from Dagestan, a woman who was in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2258">She had no money, so I took her without hesitation.</seg>
<seg id="2259">While I tried to help her, someone I thought he would be a friend, a copy of my documents and spread it anywhere in the internet, with my phone number and a picture of me. he sent her to his Chechen friends, with the following message: "then there are no more men in Chechnya who can remove this shame?"</seg>
<seg id="2260">After that, the photos from my documents were made by WhatsApp.</seg>
<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015 I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">When I was doing a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car, I heard a male voice saying, "Here is a gift for you from your uncle."</seg>
<seg id="2263">When I turned around, I felt something in my body, but I didn't hurt.</seg>
<seg id="2264">"" "then I heard a sentence, but this time in Chechnya:" "" "how long will you still honor your family, you scandal?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2265">I did not know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I only know that it was a young man, not 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and woke up last end in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently, some women had received everything and started to scream.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man was fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called a ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital I learned that I had two wounds in my right lung.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which cases were you laid - in which of the men or the women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are out of date, there's still my male name on it; but the doctor understood and put me to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very thankful for that.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time in his office, I was afraid to do it; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him for being respectful of me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I received threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They demanded to send me back to Chechnya to prove that it was all a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They asked me absurd demands: some told me that I had to prove it by running through the streets up above; others wanted me to appear on the official television in Grozny and say that I didn't change my gender, that everything was just bad, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what would I have to say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some older people once spoke my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"" "they said to her," "" "They have brought a monster to the world that has not only damaged your family, but the entire Republic." ""</seg>
<seg id="2290">We cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you have to disappear from here. "</seg>
<seg id="2291">It was too much for my mother and she put a rope around her neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Fortunately, the neighbors came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At that time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later, under the window was a car with darkened windows and a number plate with a 95.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it had happened for the third time, it became clear to me that something was lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights friends checked the number plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you fly?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons I don't want to give up their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With their help I left the country, but then something incredible happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought it without registering myself, without identification, without anything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw them into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked in to the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered for a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I plugged the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">At the moment when I wanted to call my mother via WhatsApp, I got a message: "you don't believe you're in safety just because you left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people know in which hotel you are stuck. they even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Only to prove it to you: it is the number 115. "</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine that?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">But we don't talk about the gender equality which is a taboo subject.</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still wear some traditional Caucasian elements in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">As much as I wish, I cannot overcome this mental barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with camera, I really try to look at the person they remember from their past - that is, my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends do, those who have stayed there?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I filed a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For this I needed up-to-date information on the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who had imprisoned in argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that no people were arrested and tortured during the Ramadan, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not lock a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">With that, I mean, they probably invite relatives, these take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end demand a proof that the so-called "honor" has experienced through blood satisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are gay men still trapped in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says there are just not many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, above all, those who have no wealthy relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives in order to stand for Kadyrows's judgment.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are held there so that they can present them later as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">"" "say:" "" "if they are killed, they will show their bodies on television and claim they had attacked any village or military base." ""</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people had not simply disappeared, they were deliberately immersed in order to radicalise themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is that just a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was imprisoned in argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people disappeared in this prison after their beard had grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new from them ever since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them with them.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person was even when these people were taken along.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Up to now they were not presented as bandits, but there have been no reports so far. however, we suspect that such actions are quite possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else would it not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know whether these persecutions and kidnappings of people belonging to a so-called "nontraditional" orientation have already occurred in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think already before 2003 I was already known in Grozny, when I still lived there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In earnest!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when Sharia was considered, I had never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, at that time it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">"" "Russia wanted to introduce us to the" "" "civilisation" "", "but eventually threw us back into the Stone Age." ""</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is it possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked; I had tinted lashes, bore tube-jeans and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Defence of Sharia has never weakened my hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Before the Russian Theatre in Grozny there was a place where every evening, especially weekends, met a whole group of people like me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several benches were standing, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechnya language there is a saying: Kharda ma Kharda. that is, "Don't laugh at the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">It is often said to children when they are funny about sick people.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they shut their eyes closed because they thought you were ill?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never insulted me, never hunted and never beaten.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long held this time of grace?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: until Kadyrov stepped onto the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began to talk about morality on television.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He spoke not about us per se, but primarily about the behaviour of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - you could feel how people started to change in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Those who had smiled and laughed at once looked at you with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home, I could feel the situation in the republic steadily deteriorated.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you do now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn a lot - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I am still active as an activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organize tea steaks, gatherings, I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food types.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't spend a cent for it.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I have discovered these people myself when I shut off the type of refuge.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslims and I want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you have a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that is silly.</seg>
<seg id="2383">This is Nature, it has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as Chechens who want to white you with foam in front of the mouth that there are no boils with them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagestanes have which, the cabardines have which, the Russians have also which; on the whole planet they exist - but "not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">I come from there, so it's unpleasant for me to hear something like that.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men from the Caucasus here.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the Mosque and fast during Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">Know, many think of Transiberty to men who love men, and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that is a fallacy.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different ways of feeling, to be precise, different attitudes of life.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">I'm sorry I'm going to be so personal here, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I'm not sad at all - I just know that I am myself now.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Local groups warn against an increase of suicide in the impoverished Arab Ahrazi community in Iran</seg>
<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahwaz region suffers from an unusually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Over the past few months there has been a strong increase in suicide.</seg>
<seg id="2398">The photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patriotic Arab Democratic Movement in Ahraz.</seg>

<seg id="2400">The self-burning of a man named Jassim Moramazi on 27 August drew the desperate situation of the Arab Ahrazi community in Iran which is shaped by poverty and unemployment, into the limelight.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the Ahraz region in the southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered from anxiety, depression, and was ashamed of his own helplessness, inability to pay for his family, so Ahrazi's human rights groups who want to work in Ahraz and remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video shared on YouTube held the moments after he had ignited himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people quickly managed to extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was brought to Taleghani hospital in Ahraz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the burns were so strong that doctors were unable to do anything anymore.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died short time later.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide that happened in August within the Arab Ahrazi minority, and activists on site warn that more men could take life.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahrazi Centre for Human Rights reported that several others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim - reported this month.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have one thing in common: they were all family fathers who were helpless and unable to feed their families because of the persecution on the part of the Iranian government.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahrazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region, in which a large part of the Arab Ahrazi community living in Iran, was shaken by a profound economic crisis, which makes it difficult for the native Arab population to deny its livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="2412">A century ago, the Arab Ahraz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi monarchy assumed power and in 1925 undertook great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran, as well as some of the most profitable and valuable land for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy is still developing only slowly, and the native population has little of this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often the victim of untreated diseases, hunger and deprivation.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime systematically refuses the Ahrazi Arabians to work in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government also built a large number of dams that divert water from the Arab areas into the Persian territories, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom lie.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only led to deteriorating the devastation caused in the region by dryness, and destroying local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab AFishermen rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohamed Pur, the Director General of Iran for cooperatives, work and social welfare, reported that 5% of Ahrazis, who are looking for a job, completed primary school, completed 55% of secondary school and 45% have a university degree.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"" "a" "" "systematic strategy" "" "aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2422">Karim Dohihimi, an Iranian Suswazi human rights activist resident in London, told Global Voices that the present situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment and racist ethnic discrimination," led to a "high rise" of the number of suicide among young Ahrazi.</seg>
<seg id="2423">The reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians coming from Ahraz and anti-Arab discrimination in the recruitment process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">Since officials and institutions prefers not recruiting Arab workers, the local Arab Ahrazi is deprived of access to work opportunities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime, aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance to young Arabs and forcing them to earn their livelihood outside their home country of Ahraz.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their first and last names to hide their affiliation to the Ahrazi, and so be hired, since even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated, let alone the pronunciation of the Arabic language or the wearing of Arab clothing.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the circumstances that the Ahrazi had to endure, human rights activists attack alarm before the situation is explosive.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world is waking up and knowing it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>
<seg id="2430">Depression is treatable and suicide is avoidable.</seg>

<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ayomide Zuri and was originally published on Afroféminas website. the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">They can be read in the comments under the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I am not a feminist, many women - especially white women, who call themselves intersectional feminists - react with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put well thought out scientific and societal arguments before me, why I should be feminist and why we should be all feminists in general.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, despite equal education, women still earn less money than men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women encounter a glass ceiling in various areas of life sooner or later, and that discrimination based on sex is still moving across the many different countries and beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I suffer twice and threefold under it.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet, when I come to skin colour, on racism, on black women women, on black women in the LGBTIQ community or on black women from the Diaspora; when I mention how we have always been abused physically, mentally and verbally, both in and out of the feminist movement, many white feminists and white intersectional feminists decided to remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="2448">However, all agree that women - all women - should come together to "lift up their voices and sing" Kumbaya, my Lord "to achieve equal rights (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they do not want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexualised violence, there is a institutionalised form of racial-motivated violence, which we are faced with black women in twofold manner.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnicities and places of origin earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to the school as white girls due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk to suffer domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want all women, all men, and all men of any skin color have the same rights; on the other hand, I cannot join a movement in whose centre the white woman stands who refuses to take into account unfairness in her thinking, which relate to the sex as well as the skin color of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my belonging to a white-feminist sphere that has rejected me and countless other black women over and over again.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"" "in 1851" "" "am I not a woman?" "" "and I too refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a menial and marginalised creature in historical terms." ""</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to join groups that also absorb our customs and customs through cultural appropriation to promote their egocentric program.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer try to explain white women the importance of overlap of skin color and gender. for some of them continue to mention the importance of black women for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to teach them a better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although intersectional feminism was founded to give a home to women of different origins and isolate themselves from white feminism, there is still the word "feminism" in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to dissolve myself completely from feminism and to join the Movement of Womanism, which was called to life for my dark skin and my status as a woman, rather than advocating for a white-feminist paradigm that is so stubborn that intersectionality is celebrated as a new phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever that black women define us according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book "Africana" anism: "claims" (e.g.: Africa-Womanism: as we recapture ourselves) speaks of defending ourselves in our own way. and not only that - black women can in this way create spaces where they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural, mental, psychological, physical and even spiritual elements can be worshipped, which make up the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists will immediately call separatism and exclusion after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement by which the black woman is affected.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment I can lift up black women and women of other cultures, for in this paradigm I exist.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I am recognized as a part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and my being as a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can flourish in an environment where my life is neither ignored nor ignored, nor rejected.</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the abbreviated and edited version of the article "The Wave of Violence Against Women in Paraguay" by Electural. the article is part of the series # PorSerMujer (# weighteinefraubin) reporting about the violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protect the affected people.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police commissioner told Ada Báez that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her ex-partner who had become violent.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of their relationship, some time has passed and the police said their statement would be put to the files, but more could not be done.</seg>
<seg id="2484">When another woman showed Balbuena due to maltreatment, the informed indication of Ada Báez also took advantage of nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later the second woman returned her ad.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If women report a complaint at all, they generally do not receive any support from the State.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse them. this also explains why only 20% of all women, who admit to be victims of violence, are at all reporting to the law enforcement authorities.</seg>
<seg id="2489">Inhalt1 Strikes and Statistics 2 Invisible mistreatment and a legal system that does not underline Paraguay's laws: good approach, faulty implementation impacts and statistics</seg>
<seg id="2490">It is difficult to determine how many women are really abused, "says Mirian González, researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Documentación y Estudios, a social science research institute in Paraguay." there are several indications and reports, but they do not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay, "she explains.</seg>
<seg id="2491">The available numbers, however, are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, 9600 ads of domestic violence began at the District Attorney's Office. 70% of these were violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5,000 adverts due to domestic violence in the courts of peace. here again, 86% of the ads came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the ads, 40% of women reported that they were physically abused, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">These statistics, however, do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the Paraguayan women minister Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually shown. "to any woman who has been notified in Paraguay for psychological abuse, 9 women who do not do so.</seg>
<seg id="2498">"" "" "" "for every woman refunded for bodily abuse, two women who do not do this," "" "she declared at the end of 2014." ""</seg>
<seg id="2499">Because women's murder is not a criminal offence in Paraguay, law enforcement agencies cannot adequately document how many women are murdered by their current or former partners each year.</seg>
<seg id="2500">By August 2016 alone, journalists counted at least 12 cases of suicide in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to their estimates, in Paraguay, every ten days a woman died because of violent acts by men.</seg>

<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos. but for two years she endured psychic violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most severe recognizable:</seg>

<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report on the abuse by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without naming names, she wrote posts on Facebook where she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told how he had insulted them.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their posts, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically, if he ever lifted the hand against them and refused to admit that his behavior was also a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why she had fallen by Carlos for so long and did not leave him earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse would at least have a certain complicity in it.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, who does not come from Paraguay, fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner was abusing her.</seg>

<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the testimonies of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victoria's case, everything started with psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her affluent partner even managed to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat her.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victoria's advertisements with the authorities stayed without a result and also from their relatives, it received no support.</seg>
<seg id="2524">She conducted a trial against her former partner who developed into an unmanageable juridical struggle between Paraguay and her home country, primarily for money, power and the influence of her former partner.</seg>

<seg id="2528">Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay, also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2529">On 10 August 2016, a bill was discussed in the Paraguayan parliament, which was known under the hashtag # Porellas (# Duelas).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the # NiUnaMenos movement are part of a campaign on Twitter supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original draft of the law stipulates that feminism is to be explained and punishable by a perpetual offence, as is the case in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">So the bill was changed in some points to also win the deputies for the law which feared that the path to decriminalisation of abortions would be denied, which is currently banned in Paraguay, and will be punished with up to five years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The original bill had foreseen that most of the (bureaucratic and economic) procedural costs which the victims of violence must present themselves, if they just want to refund and receive a secure accommodation, to impose the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient financial means for it:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay, maltreatment is seen as a part of interpersonal relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Here, a rethink must take place so that violence is no longer regarded as something normal.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Whoever is silent in the face of these facts, complicates himself and contributes to the fact that the offenders get away.</seg>
<seg id="2538">"" "" "" "we need to report as long as mishandling does not apply any more than normal." ""</seg>
<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the law was passed in the Paraguayan Senate. however, parts of the law had been changed before, among other things, a passage that the partners called up for reconciliation in cases of domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2540">Opinions on the changes take place.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The section on reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggressor to attack his victim again.</seg>

<seg id="2547">More than a year ago, the Ottoman authorities closed the independent Arab-language journal Azamn because of their coverage of corruption in the sultan.</seg>
<seg id="2548">Yousef Al-Haj, one of the editors of the newspaper, continues to be in prison where he is serving a one year prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2549">Two other editors of Azamn, Ibrahim Al-Maamari and Zaher Al-Abri, were also arrested and brought to trial, but later released.</seg>
<seg id="2550">Oman has been governed since 1970 by Sultan Qabus ibn Said, who came to power after he had dismissed his father, Said ibn Taimur, by a coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="2551">Since then, in addition to his role as the only sultan, he has held the most important positions in the country: Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, Minister of Finance, Foreign Affairs, Chairman of the Supreme Council for the planning and President of the Central Bank.</seg>
<seg id="2552">The Sultan's rule is characterised by the insistent efforts of security forces, especially domestic intelligence, public liberties, including freedom of the press, restricting and incarnating human rights defenders, independent journalists, bloggers and other activists.</seg>
<seg id="2553">The authorities are systematically restricting peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights, also campaigners to freely express their views on the public affairs of the country such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline.</seg>
<seg id="2554">The attack on Azamn newspaper, their closing and detention of three of their editors last year is a hard blow to the freedom of the press in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2555">Azamn is an independent newspaper, which has been reported since its inception in 2007 on corruption in Oman (an absolute monarchy) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2556">On 28 July 2016, security forces Ibrahim Al-Maamari, editor-in-chief of Azamn, announced that an article entitled "High-ranking Parties bind the hands of the judiciary" was published in the newspaper on July 26, 2016.</seg>

<seg id="2563">On 26 September 2016, the first trial in the trial against Al-Maamari, Al-Haj and Al-Abri was held before the Court in Maskat.</seg>
<seg id="2564">The Court sentenced the three journalists to prison sentences and ordered the final closure of the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2565">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were both condemned, inter alia, to disturb public order, "abuse of the Internet" and "undermining the Present of the State."</seg>
<seg id="2566">In addition, Al-Haj was found guilty of the violation of a ban on publication and the slander.</seg>
<seg id="2567">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were sentenced to three years imprisonment and fines in the amount of 3,000 Yuan ($7800). in addition, a year-old prohibition of employment was imposed on the two journalists.</seg>
<seg id="2568">Al-Abri was sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of 1000 Rial (2600 US dollars) after he was found guilty of using "an information network to spread material that could pose a threat to public order."</seg>
<seg id="2569">For Al-Abri, a security deposit amounting to $5000 was fixed ($13,000) and was released on 22 August 2016 before the pronouncement of the sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2570">The Appeals Court acquitted Al-Abri in a hearing on 26 December 2016, but sentenced Al-Haj to six months in prison for a year and Al-Maamari.</seg>
<seg id="2571">Al-Maamari was released on 10 April 2017 after his six-month prison sentence from the Central prison in Maskat. al-Haj is still in prison where he served his one year sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2572">The Appeals Court also highlighted the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the Azamn newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2573">Despite the decision of the Court to leave Azamn again, the newspaper continues to face attacks by the government of the Congo.</seg>
<seg id="2574">On 8 January, the Minister of Information issued an order with which the closure of "Azamn" was extended by three months.</seg>
<seg id="2575">On 8 May 2017, the Minister of Information personally signed another order in which the closing of "Azamn" was extended by three additional months, and with which the minister announced another time against the decision of the Appeals Court to reintroduce the publication of the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2576">The ongoing closure of Azamn and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper aren't the only cases in which the freedom of the press was violated recently in Oman.</seg>
<seg id="2577">Further injuries include, for example, the closure of the site of the independent magazine Mowatin and the exercise of pressure on Albalad, the first independent online newspaper of the country to cease its operation.</seg>
<seg id="2578">Due to the ongoing closure of Azamn and the imprisonment of the journalist Al-Haj, the impression arises that the omechanical authorities are still not ready to put an end to the extensive violation of the freedom of the press.</seg>
<seg id="2579">The Gulf Centre for Human Rights (Gulf Centre for Human Rights, GCHR) calls on the authorities to:</seg>
<seg id="2580">1. to release Yousef Al-Haj immediately and unconditionally;</seg>
<seg id="2581">2. to create a safe environment for the Azamn newspaper, so that their journalists can follow their work;</seg>
<seg id="2582">3. protecting the freedom of the press in the country and</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, picture takes place with his consent</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or even mentioned in the media. it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out on-site: on the one hand, many medicines and vaccines are missing in the supply of global health care, which cover the special medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more severe consequences in Africa's poorest countries than elsewhere, and lack of investment in research on these diseases caused by pharmaceutical companies is a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Secondly, research carried out by African researchers helps build up their own research capacities in Africa. a major role of science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is the director of the Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in Lusaka, Zambia in the 1990s, just when the AIDS epidemic revealed first serious repercussions for national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he himself researched the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the sambic health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about misunderstandings of the media about this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(disclaimer: Dr. Warrier speaks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warren RW: at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results. I support the sambic national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">In addition, I am currently launching a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">GV: what are the most important current scientific topics in your country and Africa in general?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only use solutions developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This has to change, otherwise we will always be recipients instead of being a creator himself.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions we get are often not well usable in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">GV: where does the financing and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are funded in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who want to come back or go here because the financing and development chances are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">GV: what is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What are the obstacles in your routine research work that you did not have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">GV: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there is already interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GV: how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should it concentrate and how can we support the development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is need for special scientific training, starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, big data, space exploration, health care (non-communicable and infectious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GV: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa in comparison to Western countries, based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often, it is the limited speed to do things, and the difficult access to scientific expertise that challenges here.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system that journals contain articles only against payment (the so-called "Paywall"), also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research.</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "Open Source" seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This article by Rachel Cerninsky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">His company offers 114 grades such as Outreddens, the first plant grown and consumed by NASA astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years, Morton's work was limited only by his own ingenuity and the question of how many sorts of lettuce he can get.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000s, he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use them further for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">Patents applied not only for individual varieties, but also for certain properties such as resistance to disease, a special red or green tone or curled leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past few years, more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as grain or cartons. due to this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts provide food security for the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">Morton continues to grow salads as a passionate representative of a millennia-old tradition, but it takes longer, since his work is more and more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it is as if in a river there are a boulder that I have to paddle." ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">"" "so we have to do it now, but it's a break with the breeding tradition," "" "he says." "" "I think these patents go too far." ""</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stand in court, no one can breed a new type of salad, because all the characteristics are already patented. "thus, he continues to do as good as possible and tries to extract the characteristics he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, it is very cautious and endeavours not to use any material protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He also joined a movement that is becoming ever greater in the United States and all over the world: open Source Breeding ("Open Source" reins).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and ate red Römerletat of the variety Outskirts in the "glasshouse" of the station, where it is tested whether plants can be grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds as if the movement from the IT field would come from and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (Initiative for Open Source "seed) is inspired by the movement for free" open source "software, which provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was called into life to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and can be used permanently for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">In the context of the initiative, in short Ossi, US breeders can commit to freely use the seeds bred by them.</seg>
<seg id="2647">However, this does not mean that they cannot continue to do business with their seed and sell it. "open Source" breeders only allow others who buy their seeds to breed their own varieties, and do not immediately cut out - two aspects that are forbidden or prescribed by many plant patents.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the Emeritus Professor at University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi board member Jack Kloppenburg, control of seeds and the opportunity to grow new plants are important for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">According to him, seed plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, farmers' rights, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to exploit the latter not or only little by breeding seed with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg points out that the "Open Source" movement does not concern itself with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not. "in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over the seed," he says and takes stock of the increasingly common mergers in the global agriculture industry, as it is offered in August and September 2016. "if you want to buy good, locally and sustainably produced vegetables, as it is offered on farmers markets, you should also know that the way in which this vegetable is grown is threatened.</seg>
<seg id="2654">"" "food sovereignty without the sovereignty of seeds is not possible." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to ensuring that their seed continues to be freely available to others, in contrast to patented seed and plant features.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is endangered as the available gene pool is constantly shrinking due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights available on plant material, which is therefore increasingly limited.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, executive director of the Ossi, has worked in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about one third of all card features are protected as intellectual property, making it impossible for plant breeders to be used either at all or at all.</seg>
<seg id="2659">There are still no such estimates for other plants, but experts like Luby suggest that vast cultivated plants such as wheat are patented in an even greater style than salad or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are bred in such a way that they have targeted characteristics - from those, through which their taste or colour improves up to such, because of which they thrive in certain environments and withstand threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Adversaries of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing by more and more patents. however, genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the changed conditions are much less predictable due to climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto spokesperson Carly Scaduto recognises that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the United States Ministry of Agriculture, the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">However, it contradicts the notion that intellectual property restricts other breeders as "patents and the protection of plant diversity promote innovation." "a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent expires.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come to the same result with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Such protection does not inhibit innovation, but encourages them by providing more material and expertise to the public. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees it differently: 20 years waiting until a patent expires, certainly does not promote innovation.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait so long to breed plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions, you would have already lost the fight.</seg>
<seg id="2669">However, the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should continue to remain: "independent plant breeders have neither the time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "this is what drives us, and it is impossible for us to continue using the best and newest genetic resources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">"" "in all, Morton interferes with the concept of patented plant traits:" "" "we do not really create the traits themselves." ""</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form them themselves and as breeders we finally have no idea how the plants do that.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeder in the US state of Oregon and Ossi board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "whoever breeds a variety, also breeding his own values into it.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures will be required to produce massive herbicides for their cultivation, who culminates in its varieties of this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "my concept is exactly opposite." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (those who move on international markets, but smaller than e.g. Monsanto are) patents, do most of the smaller seed companies to survive without patents - either they reject patents or they keep it too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both are the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton is looking for salads at his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton is also convinced that breeders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents: "it looks like I'm getting stronger than firms with my efforts to produce something new.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I constantly need new material for my catalogue, since I know that my competitors will sell my grades in a few years, "he says." with a patent it is protected for 20 years from competition, with which one makes it quite easy in my opinion. "worldwide resonance</seg>
<seg id="2683">Although the USA seems to be leading in the "open source" breeding, the concept is now spreading rapidly throughout the world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (Centre for Sustainable Agriculture), which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources, is working together with farmers and helps them grow new varieties that meet certain requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports them to come to "open source" seeds and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">"" "the German organization Agrecol works on an" "" "open source" "" "license which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of Ossi obligation for breeders in the European Union." ""</seg>
<seg id="2687">(regulations for breeding vary from country to country, therefore the Ossi obligation cannot be easily adopted one to one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">At the beginning of November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declared that conventionally bred plants should not be patentable. thus, it speaks against the current practice of the European Patent Office, which allows for patents on conventionally cultivated plants.</seg>
<seg id="2689">One explanation, however, is not a law; now it is up to the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line.</seg>
<seg id="2690">In October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos organized a conference on "Open Source" seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa came together to learn about the "open source" seed movement and the worldwide trend towards the patenting of seeds.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos's "Open Source" seed systems, explains that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for "open source" seed systems for which scheduled next year will be the official starting signal.</seg>
<seg id="2692">A consortium of environmental and development aid groups (including Hivos, the international non-profit aid organization USC Canada and the Action Group on erosion, technology and concentration) has compiled a database on seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map.</seg>
<seg id="2693">In September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the global alliance for the future of food, has published a report to support organizations such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and others. it believes farmers have the opportunity to come to seed, exchange and improve the seed policy so that a stable supply of food can be ensured.</seg>
<seg id="2694">The report also highlights the importance of a diverse, local supply of seed for sustainable food systems - a context that Luby von Ossi hopes that more people will soon see him.</seg>
<seg id="2695">"" "" "" "the movement for regional and ecological foods has particularly taken care of where and how something is grown, and seed systems have hardly played a role in doing so," "" "said Luby." "" "we are now trying to make people clear that there is even more behind their foods." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organization and blog are the newest aims of censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">The Egyptian authorities still block content on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of 5 August, the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents violations of human rights in Egypt and the Arab world and reported about it.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the network published an opinion on Facebook, in which it sharply criticized the Egyptian authorities for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic Network for Human Rights Information has remained true to its goal in defending freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world, in order to defend freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world, so it has never been as important as now. ANHRI confirms that all technical possibilities are exhausted to overcome the barriers and not give in. we insist on carrying out our task.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered to be the first censored website of a human rights organization in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 sites more than two months ago, such as the Independent news page Mada Masr, Arabic-speaking issue of the Huffington Post and the Qatar-based Al Jazeera network for alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organisation of the wave of seismic barriers to the victim. @ anhri is one of the main sources of human rights in Arab language https: / / t.co / NIZmPDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">Besides ANHRI, the blog of the columnist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada has no access to Egypt anymore.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada took advantage of his blog for the spread of columns and articles that he wrote in Egypt not accessible websites and media.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog he set up to circumvent the censorship of the Egyptian government, even the target of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider with whom also the blog's blog is located, is more accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photo journalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, reporting about the student protests and recorded a video of how the police exercised physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles are mainly about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada expressed himself in blocking the government and reflected what this meant for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The blogs to lock is very old, but has priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi; and even if blocking the blogs may not be significant for the world, it is for two reasons for me:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It succeeded in giving me the feeling of a state of siege; arrest, attempted murder, a charge at the National Security Council, blocking blogs as well as any other website I worked for.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have proven that I did not write in vain. in other words: my words have influence, albeit only to a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First I used it to post articles to circumvent the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">But now, after they have locked him and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The brave walk the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">The Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte) blocked Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06 August 133 websites. this resulted in technical tests on the networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and ETISALAT.</seg>
<seg id="2743">Afte also documented the blocking of providers by switching online censorship and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">Afte reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12 we noticed how the blocking of web pages that VPNs offer began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such a practice points to the government's intention to further block and filter content on which Egyptian users could have access.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"" "" "" "the situation is additionally worsened by the fact that the censorship decisions are made behind closed doors, which means that the Egyptian population does not have a legal basis to act against these acts." ""</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the censorship and whom will it attack next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants argue.</seg>
<seg id="2751">The Brazilian army was deployed in the Favelas in Niterói, a city in the state of Rio de Janeiro, during the government crisis.</seg>
<seg id="2752">Photo by: Estado Maior (CML) via photos públicas, CC-BY-NC 2.0</seg>
<seg id="2753">Day after day newspapers in Brazil are reporting dark headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motifs.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"" "" "" "14-year-old shot in school," "" "Every second day a police officer is murdered in Rio de Janeiro," "" "Thieves smokes pharmacy with military weapons," "" "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, navy and air sea to Rio." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2756">In the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, the wave of violence in Rio achieved its highest level for 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organisation Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become everyday and this is unacceptable & # 8212; at least you will find the manager of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"" "the editorial" "" "Extra" "", "known for the detailed reporting of violence in Rio on 16 August, published the editorial" "" "This is not normal" "", "in which she announced to set up a new section called" "" "War in Rio" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports of violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The newspaper explained the motives for their decision:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report about crimes that happen in every major city in the world such as murder, robbery, sex crimes, etc. everything, however, deviates from the civilized standard and what happens only in Rio is published in the category "War in Rio." (...) This is our way to call: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, editor-in-chief of the newspaper, declared that this decision was not a cause for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">It is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war rubric in a country that does not recognize the war.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist from the newspaper explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 843 areas controlled by criminal organizations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial, the newspaper writes:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war discourse, if it is distorted, can also be used to cover the atrocities of the police that only shoots and then asks questions.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose goal is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the Mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" harm more than it uses?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, the journalist Cecília Oliveira argued against violence as a "war." this was in their opinion a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to hold responsible for the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and bad planning - as demonstrated by the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel, education and a historical and complacent neglect of public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">In memory, Rio de Janeiro State is bigger than its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2776">Photo by: Fernando Fracão / Agência Brasil. publication with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="2777">Call Rio de Janeiro as "the most violent place in Brazil," according to Cecília is wrong: "22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to the statistics of 2015 in the north and northeast of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2778">None of these cities are located in the state of Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="2779">When we look at the Mordrates per State, Rio is ranked 16, "she writes.</seg>
<seg id="2780">In addition, Globo is one of South America's largest media enterprise, which, as Cecília emphasises, has been repeating the state's security policy for years.</seg>
<seg id="2781">These security policy measures included the establishment of the UPP (Unidade de Polícia Pacificadora), a police unit deployed in Rio in 2003, whose goal is to capture a Favela by deploying a massive police station and permanently stationing a unit there.</seg>
<seg id="2782">In the beginning, the UPP was increasingly under fire after several reports of harassment and repression against the poor communities, which should actually protect the newly created police unit.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, journalist João Paulo Charleaux was quoted from one of his articles in 2010, explaining why the violence in Rio does not correspond to the criteria defined by the Geneva Conventions for the term "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also entails serious consequences for people.</seg>
<seg id="2786">This requires the state to use resources and ways that are typical of a war. this includes penetration into the territory of a "enemy," where a civilian is an unassailable point in the landscape and becomes an object for "collateral damage" and "lost balls."</seg>
<seg id="2787">The fact is that the inhabitants of the favela in Rio continue to suffer.</seg>
<seg id="2788">It is now a week that the police clapped the mountain with the favela Jacarzinho to avenge the death of a policeman.</seg>
<seg id="2789">In the midst of all this violence, this incident also made headlines: an orchard died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2802">Since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the following civil war, many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and blockades, mainly by the Assad regime against loyal troops.</seg>
<seg id="2803">According to victory Watch, a joint initiative of the peace organization PAX and the research institute The Syria Institute, there are currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege in Damascus and surrounding, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib.</seg>
<seg id="2804">The region of Eastern Ghouta, where an attack with chemical weapons on August 21, 2013 demanded the life of hundreds of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organizations and the Syrian opposition are assuming that the massacre of the Assad regime was perpetrated by the United Nations and other human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since 2013, these rebel controlled areas outside Damascus have been under siege, leading to the need for local residents to be purchased locally or by tunnels and control points.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Due to the years of blockade, traditional food like meat has become unattainable for large parts of the population.</seg>
<seg id="2808">As a countermeasure, a group of Syrian humanitarian workers and academics teach the inhabitants of Eastern Ghoutas how they can plant their own mushrooms as "life-saving food source."</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Alnahda and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Mushrooms do not belong to the traditional food produced in Syria and are very rarely part of the Syrian cuisine. however, their nutritional quality makes them an attractive source of food for many residents of the besieged Eastern Ghouta.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The direct of the project, Abo Nabil, said to AFP, the French news agency:</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "" "" "we chose to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because they can plant them in houses and cellars." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">Dr. Ahmed Leila, one of the organizers, reports Global Voices, who has been fighting for three years to make this project known and expressed his relief that it is becoming more and more known. "</seg>
<seg id="2814">To collect money for the initiative, we use the humanitarian Crowdfunding platform CanDo in consultation with the NGO Ghiras Alnahda.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It is planned to give 125 families knowledge of planting mushrooms, so Dr. Leila to Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2816">At the time of the Constitution of this article, they have reached over 100% of their expected target of around 12,700 euros, but will continue to collect donations to CanDo until Monday, 04 September 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Due to the shortage of fuel, locally produced plastic fuels are used to supply the generators with the necessary energy.</seg>
<seg id="2819">"" "Dr. Leila said Global Voices that they began with the" "" "production of fungal seeds originating from regions" "" "before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption." ""</seg>
<seg id="2820">Then they planted a small mushroom farm in a tub. when this succeeded, they used a bigger tub. and so on.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Now they have designed a "educational farm for the region."</seg>
<seg id="2822">Since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months, they have distributed fungi throughout Eastern Ghouta free of charge.</seg>

<seg id="2833">Several hundred people protested on 21 October in many provincial capitals in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of fires that were rampant in the north of Portugal in the week before.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two persons died and about 70 were injured as a result of the fires of 15 and 16 October. this led to the last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Fires were also registered in the Galicia region in Spain where there were 4 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there were more than 500 fire-breakers spreading in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages.</seg>
<seg id="2837">In June, a similar tragedy occurred in Pedrógão Grande, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 wounded.</seg>
<seg id="2838">According to the European forest monitoring system, which monitors the forest areas via satellite images, about 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district.</seg>
<seg id="2839">So that you can get a better picture of the seriousness of the situation: there is no fire in 4 districts.</seg>

<seg id="2846">People wondered why civil protection was not able to curb the scale of the tragedy as far as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2847">João Soveral from the Federation of the Farmers of Portugal explained the newspaper Público:</seg>
<seg id="2848">After Pedrógão roads and villages were evacuated for everything and nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This Sunday they did not do this anywhere else: there are dozens of open roads surrounded by fire.</seg>

<seg id="2851">Furthermore, building permits are questioned in places with a high risk of fire.</seg>
<seg id="2852">A far-reaching proposal for the reform of the forest, which the government had brought after serious fires in 2003 and 2005, was objected by the local authorities who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment.</seg>
<seg id="2853">"the government introduced a loosening of the law, which allowed construction activity in case the applicant had funds for self-defence - that was an open back door so that everything could be built," continues João Sorval in the same article of the Público newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2854">The environmental organization Quercus pointed out that large areas with eucalyptus, trees made of slightly combustible wood, like in a vicious circle, continue to spread to fires of this kind.</seg>
<seg id="2855">To these problems, the website of Civil Defence of Portugal on 15 and 16 October, when inhabitants requested information or attempted to contact relatives, was offline.</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that provided information to the population: they used their own civil protection data using the application fogos.ge and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">The project was launched in 2015 by the developer João Pina in order to simplify the work of the fire brigade and was so crucial at this fateful weekend in October that the servers did not stop the onslaught of the 400,000 users who followed fires: the website counted more than half a million hits.</seg>

<seg id="2902">So it was also Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his unconditional lifetime helped Asharaf to get rid of these conditions soon.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After having made various works in the construction industry for several years, Asharaf put all his savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast-snack bar.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Asharaf Baratis's success story is now the topic of the documentary "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (German: "behind Venetian luxury - a Hazara in Italy") by director Amin Wahidi.</seg>
<seg id="2907">The film won the Venice City Award 2017, which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Much bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just a few of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to unofficial estimates, about 20,000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them, the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years some Afghans run companies, including tailors, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were praised even in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice, Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his Restaurant Orient Experience in which the waiters and kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy by the different Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek courts.</seg>
<seg id="2919">The Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari in Padua opened the restaurant Peace & amp; Spice and also behind the pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna and a sushi restaurant in Rome are also Afghans.</seg>
<seg id="2920">But Ashark's goals go far beyond the Italian gastronomic industry and retail, and aim back to the country, which he had to leave as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"where there is a risk, there are also opportunities," says Asharaf with a smile. "I want to invest in Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id="2922">I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily if I know that my people are suffering.</seg>
<seg id="2923">I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country, especially for women.</seg>
<seg id="2924">"" "they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as everyone else." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2925">"" "Asharaf also forges plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul, where people can learn packaging and preservation techniques." "" "so they can sell their crop surpluses on the market and improve their financial situation," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2926">The development of a successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt, but in the end stability and prosperity.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Asharaf has made this journey himself. now he wants to help other Afghans on this journey.</seg>
<seg id="2928">Netizen report: violations of social networks Mahmoud Abu Zaid, aka Shawkan, have been in custody for more than 900 days.</seg>
<seg id="2929">He reported on the clearing of the camp Raba'a el Adaweya in Cairo that protested against the decomposition of President Mohamed Morsi.</seg>

<seg id="2931">Global Voices Advocacys Netizen Report is an international snapshot that shows challenges, victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights</seg>
<seg id="2932">The Egyptian parliament reviews a draft bill that previews that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration with a government authority.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Users must register to use social networks within six months of the submission of the law on the authority's website indicating their full name and ID number.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Those who neglect this step could be sentenced to six months "imprisonment or the final settlement of a penalty.</seg>
<seg id="2935">The law, which was applied by sixty members of parliament, is currently facing the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be debated there.</seg>
<seg id="2936">In May, another MP filed a legislative proposal that would introduce tougher sanctions on the insulting of the President or of a senior official.</seg>
<seg id="2937">Under Egyptian law, the President's insult as well as state institutions is already punishable. however, such a crime would be punished with prison and fines, according to legal experts at the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy.</seg>
<seg id="2938">Should the law be passed, this may mean up to three years "imprisonment for the convicted.</seg>
<seg id="2939">In addition, this would underpin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2940">A striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he photographed Egyptian police while demonstrating violence against demonstrators who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the removal of the elected president Mohamed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "" "" "Shawrikan waited, as more than 700 protest participants were arrested for the same incident four years in jail for a court date." ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">Recently, his trial was postponed to the 20th of May, because the prison administration, according to human rights groups, failed to bring the defendant from prison to the courtroom.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Shawkan faces the death penalty due to one, so many human rights groups agree, including ceasefire, illegal assembly, murder and attempted murder.</seg>
<seg id="2944">In another case, a criminal court in Giza released the two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosad Al-Barbary. they were indicted for their reporting on the pro-Morsi seat blockade on Raba'a Al-Adawiya square in Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="2945">The court also reduced the sentences of the journalists Abdullah al-Fakharany, Samhi Mustafa, and Mohamed al-Adly, who were also arrested at the previous incident, from 25 years to 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Tunisian activist interrogated to leaked documents</seg>
<seg id="2947">In May Tunisian authorities spent six hours with the interrogation of Sami Ben-Gharah, who is co-founder of the independent media platform Nawaat and the Global Voices Advocacy Project.</seg>
<seg id="2948">Ben-Gharah was chiefly interrogated to a more experienced plan of action. said plan was provided by the President of the Republic, who explicitly supports business people and during the former regime by dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of corruption, provided they return all unlawful funds.</seg>
<seg id="2949">The document published on the website of Nawaat on April 21 throws a light on how the presidential plans look to the support of the legislation.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Ben-Gharah rejected the naming of his sources by specifying Article 11 of the Tunisian Press Code, which journalists access right to protection of their sources.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Nevertheless, he appeared as a witness in the Tunis District Court on May 9th.</seg>
<seg id="2952">Will China force the users of social media to submit their ID?</seg>
<seg id="2953">According to new regulations by the Office of the People's Republic of China, the users of social media in China require a permit before they write or share news in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2954">It is also stated in the rules that registration will be necessary with the full real name.</seg>
<seg id="2955">Analysts assume that this will allow the elimination of anonymous comments in conversations within social networks. up to now it is unclear how the authorities will apply these regulations.</seg>
<seg id="2956">"" "" "" "Chinese citizens have proposed social media to selectively enforce these rules in order to protect citizen journalism and its independence." ""</seg>
<seg id="2957">Do we see ourselves in "WeChat"?</seg>
<seg id="2958">Not in Russia!</seg>
<seg id="2959">May the state censorship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese Messaging App WeChat.</seg>
<seg id="2960">According to Roskomnadzor, WeChat refused to register with the state government as an "organiser of information distribution."</seg>
<seg id="2961">This designation is part of a 2014 law, thanks to which the Russian government provides a list of online services that organize the "publication of information." the law also allows the government to make obsessed services responsible for the removal of content and to force it on request to suspend user data.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Websites such as Vkontakte and Odnostandniki (Russia's two most popular social networks), the Image Board 2.ch.hk, the e-mail service mail.ru and dozens of other services.</seg>
<seg id="2963">Turkish court has ban on Wikipedias</seg>
<seg id="2964">A Turkish court ordered Wikipedias in Turkey, after Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English-language articles, the declarations that Turkey supports the jihadists in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="2965">The Turkish Ministry of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communications said that the site was blocked because it became "a source of information that cooperates with groups to foment a political defamation campaign against Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="2966">It is the first time Turkey has blocked the website completely. it is thus, besides China, one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Great Britain cannot stop snuffing</seg>
<seg id="2968">After this week, the UK government is in the midst of a deliberate consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and to install Backdoor programs that decrypt data encryption.</seg>
<seg id="2969">The government has consulted telecommunications companies and secret services regarding the proposal, but has left other technology companies and the civilian population on the outside.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Despite all this, the consultation still runs until May 19. reactions and proposals by members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior.</seg>
