this is James Ris@@ en .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as New York Times repor@@ ter .
long before anyone had heard of Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ularly that the N@@ SA has illeg@@ ally listened to tel@@ eph@@ ones of Americans .
but there is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation , in which the CIA gave Iran literally dra@@ fts for a nuclear bomb .
if that sounds crazy , read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who didn &apos;t like the chapter ?
the U.S. government .
for almost 10 years , the government has determined against Ris@@ en and called upon him to call his supposed sources .
in this turn , he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern of condem@@ ning whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers and spy journalists .
according to the First Constitution , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right if media does not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the cour@@ a@@ geous ones they are revealing .
so when the government kno@@ cked at Ris@@ en , he did something that many cour@@ a@@ geous repor@@ ters had already done before him : he refused and said that he would rather go to jail .
from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en lived with the risk of going to jail .
but then , just days before the trial , something extraordinary happened .
suddenly , although they have been indications for years that it would be essential in their case , the government &apos;s demands were dropped .
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring , repor@@ ters and sources can hide more and less .
instead of failing and bringing tears to the testimony , this could also do its digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , have secretly bought his telephone lines ,
just as his e @-@ mail data , financial and bank information , his credit journey , and even travel cards with the list of his flights .
in the midst of this information , they found evidence that they used to den@@ ounce Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA &apos;s whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and a rup@@ ture .
unfortunately , this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers . but instead , the judi@@ ci@@ ary has condemned more than all US governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of its work as a secret .
since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower going to a journalist .
so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional proposition because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on everyone .
but just as the government &apos;s technology allows to circum@@ vent the rights of repor@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources .
and they can do this from the moment they are in contact , rather than in hin@@ d@@ sight , witness .
today there is communication software , which has not yet existed when Ris@@ en had written his book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls .
such technology is Secure@@ Drop , an open @-@ source transmission system for whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , which was originally developed by the Internet world famous Aaron Swar@@ tz , and is now being developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation in which I work .
instead of sending an email , go to a news site , just like the Washington Post .
there you can upload documents or send information , just like with any usual contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server where only the respective news agency has access .
so the government cannot obtain more information secretly , and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset .
Secure@@ Drop is but only a small part of the whole in order to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments around the world are constantly developing new sp@@ ying technologies that end@@ anger all of us .
it is important to us to ensure that not only technology experts such as Edward Snow@@ den have an opportunity to off@@ end mis@@ deeds . it is equally important that we protect the next whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower ,
who knows about gri@@ ev@@ ances in the supply of soldiers and wants to report from over@@ crowded hospitals . or the next environmental staff who warns against the contaminated water of F@@ lin@@ t . or a wall street in@@ sider that warns us about the next financial crisis .
after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes , but to protect our constitutional rights .
thank you .
&#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness to hide in tax ha@@ v@@ ens &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; this week we were asked by Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; this week we were sent by news about a leak of 11 million documents of the Mos@@ ch Fon@@ sec@@ a law firm based in Panama .
the publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers come to companies like Mos@@ elle Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot;
we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages , how the whole system works as it works .
this has already resulted in very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s Prime Minister res@@ ig@@ ned .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad has mail box companies in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
it is alleged that a track of $ 2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin , a close friend of childhood days , a famous cel@@ list .
now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others who wait nervous for the next release , and the next documents revealed .
now that sounds like the plot of an agent or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham @-@ novel .
it seems crying away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should we do that ?
but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their fortune in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not pay all their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and this concerns us all .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenom@@ enal .
across the globe , media and leading politicians are discussing how secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by some few to hide and veil their assets -- something that we have been discussing and covering for ten years .
I think many people seem to be very conf@@ using this whole world , and it is hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work .
I always imagine it like a Mat@@ r@@ yo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these buildings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what it is . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; probably because there have been no prominent Americans in these revelations , this sc@@ andal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now it is not that there are no wealthy Americans hiding their fortun@@ es in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
but because of the principle behind these tax ha@@ v@@ ens , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers .
if we had a data leak from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA .
in fact , some U.S. states require less information to provide less information to establish a company than to get a library card .
this kind of in@@ transparency in the USA allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children .
it has allowed sc@@ amm@@ ers to rip off especially vulnerable arms .
it is this kind of behavior that affects all of us .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator was an African minister who wanted to bring suspi@@ cious money to the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really shocked us that everyone up to one lawyer made proposals to our investig@@ ators how to transfer his money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of these lawyers appe@@ aled to us as clients , and of course no one was given money to anybody . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important not to consider this as individual cases .
it is not about a single lawyer who has submitted suggestions to our hidden investig@@ ator .
it &apos;s not about a single top politi@@ cian , involved in a sc@@ andal .
it is about how the system works , through which corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability are established .
and in order to cope with this , we need to change the rules of the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior more difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it may sound quite absurd as if we could not do anything about it ; as if nothing had ever changed ; as if there will always be the rich and powerful .
but as a born optim@@ ist , I see that something has begun to change .
over the past few years we have seen violations of more transparency concerning the owners of companies .
the subject took political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
since then the EU has been collecting in central registers at the national level , who is really behind companies in Europe , and who controls it .
one of the uncomfortable facts is that the US is lag@@ ging behind .
representatives of both parties have introduced a draft bill in the two parliam@@ ent@@ arians , but this does not make progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how these Panama disclosure , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally .
for us with Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind bog@@ us firms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need leaders in the economy who get up and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use them to end this kind of in@@ transparency by law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together , we can finally stop the in@@ transparency that now allows this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the story of how I almost kidn@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ da .
one day after I finished my design studies , I made a back@@ yard sale .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da remained standing and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my art works .
he was alone in the city and just made a road@@ trip across the country . afterwards he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me about how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as we paid the bill , I made the mistake asking him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I thought , &quot; Oh , man !
what am I doing now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just met him ! he says he would go to peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans it . I don &apos;t want to land in the trunk of a Maz@@ da !
this is a small boot !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; u@@ h , how please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at night I was lying in bed , I gaz@@ ed at the ceiling and thought , &quot; Oh man ! what did I get there ? &quot;
a wild stranger sleeps in my living room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what if he is crazy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I got such a fear that I went out of bed , sliding on toes to the door and closing my bedroom door .
but he was not crazy at all .
we are still in contact .
the work of art he bought from me today hangs in his class@@ rooms . he is a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it completely changed my point of view .
maybe the people who were sold to me as a stranger in childhood were actually friends who were waiting to be discovered ?
to house people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress with them .
let &apos;s take a leap , two years later ...
I &apos;m unemployed , almost broke , my room@@ mate is moving and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can create fear into fun .
I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could earn something about it . our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk including a mattress and each morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and created so &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; AI@@ R@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floor .
they found it great , and we too .
I &apos;m sure our cheese @-@ ham @-@ om@@ el@@ ets ta@@ sted completely different because we made them for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them through the whole city . when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Brian and I stopped .
did we just discover that we were able to find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
things came rolling .
my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if we could make it a business concept .
this is how we presented ourselves to the investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people post public images of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the type of rooms whose doors are closed when you visit .
via the Internet , they can invite strangers to stay with them .
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited for the mis@@ sile to ign@@ ite .
but they do not .
nobody who is still in comfort would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ? why ?
because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous .
if you have a problem , you &apos;re thinking about the things you can do well . we could design .
at the Academy of Fine Arts we learned that design is much more than just look and feel -- it is the overall experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create an immense trust between people who had never met before .
can design afford such a thing ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a sample of what degree of confidence we asp@@ ire .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
th@@ um@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hands .
now I would like you to unlock your mobile phone .
give your un@@ locked phone to your left sitting next mate .
this silent touch of panic you can sense now -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to keep the un@@ locked phone of a stranger in his hands ?
most feel the responsibility .
this is how most guests feel when they stay somewhere else .
only for this reason our company can exist .
just like that , who actually has Al Gor@@ es mobile now ?
could you announce on Twitter that he is chann@@ eling for president &apos;s office ?
you can now return the cell phones .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I want to tell you about some of the discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail of this experiment ?
what if your neighbor had first presented himself with his name ; if he had told where he came from , how his dog or his children would be called ?
imagine you would have 150 testim@@ oni@@ als that all say : &quot; he really can hold tightly locked phones ! &quot;
how would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone ?
for a well thought @-@ out feedback system , confidence boo@@ sts confidence .
in the beginning we did some things wrong .
it was difficult for people to have negative jud@@ gements .
in the end , we decided to wait until both hosts and guest had given their reviews before we put them on @-@ line .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how much they are about age and place of residence .
not surprisingly , we rely on people most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social bias .
it becomes exciting when you add a person &apos;s call -- in our case by jud@@ gements .
if you have less than three ratings , nothing changes .
but if you have more than ten , everything changes .
a good call stands out com@@ mon@@ alities .
the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences .
in addition , we learned that trust is dependent on how much you give away .
here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
if you tell too little , like &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it tells too much , for example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- the request is rather not accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so there is an optimal degree of openness , e.g. &quot; great works of art in your home ! I &apos;m doing a holiday with my family . &quot;
how can we create it with design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text . we also give tips on which topics you should write something .
our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudi@@ ces against strangers .
what we didn &apos;t reck@@ on was the great amount of people who were more than willing to disman@@ tle these prejudi@@ ces .
here you can see how many people are using our offer .
you can see three things .
first : incredible luck .
second , the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
third , a demand that had not been met before .
for us , the business is going very well .
of course there are times when not everything goes smoothly .
there were guests who have not allowed parties to celebrate or rav@@ aged apartments .
hosts have let guests stand in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked with the customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I was at the forefront when trust was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts when I just think about it .
the disappointment that you hear in the voice of call@@ ers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve .
fortunately , only a fraction of the 123 million overnight stays had a problem .
for people rightly trust each other .
if trust works , it can be mira@@ culous .
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary operation !
here is its assessment :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perfect home for travelers who tend to heart attacks because of sitting activities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels who save one &apos;s life even though they don &apos;t know one .
you drive to the hospital in your own car when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they bring books by .
they let one stay even longer without calculating the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
of course , not every stay will exp@@ ire .
but these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
when I stum@@ bled over this term for the first time , I asked myself :
how does the idea of sharing with money transactions take place ?
it is about economic commerce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is not just the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the thing is not justified . &quot; &quot; &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
humans open a part of themselves , and that changes everything .
when you travel nowadays , it is easy to compare with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
but what if travelling would be a rich buffet of local impressions ?
what if in any place you visited , a group of residents would wait to fill a thoroughly and show one at a pub craw@@ l area of which you have never heard ;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would arrange apartments from the ground up to toge@@ ther@@ ness ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would accept the idea of shared participation ?
I imagine cities which enable us society and relationships instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and isolation .
in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul , this project has already begun .
were now offered residents . students who were looking for a place to stay ,
were taught to people whose children were dra@@ fted . incu@@ b@@ ator programs were launched ,
to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . via our platform alone , 7@@ 85@@ ,000 people will be guest in 191 countries overnight in a foreign or even host .
so the idea does not seem to be as crazy as it was taught us .
we didn &apos;t re@@ inv@@ ent the wheel .
hospitality was already there before .
there were similar websites before us .
so why did it just work ?
apart from luck and timing we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust .
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
I find it amazing ,
almost overwhelming .
each time I have to think about it when a Maz@@ da drives past me .
of course , we know that design cannot solve every problem .
but if it could help us , if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use in the near future .
thank you .
what do you think when you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or oppressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ?
or simply a delay in the security check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I do not blame you for your negative impressions .
so the media represent people who look like me .
one study found that 80 % of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show that the Americans think most would not know Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
for those who have never met a Muslim : it &apos;s great to get to know you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee maker -- double espresso , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a fitness @-@ fitness fan@@ atic ,
and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim .
but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I wasn &apos;t born like that .
I decided to do so .
when I was 17 , I decided to ou@@ ten me .
no , not as a hom@@ os@@ exual person , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to wear the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my femin@@ ist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the funny thing was : back then it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence , compared to the pressure that I was 17 years old to adapt to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal .
I have not only adopted the faith of my parents pas@@ sively .
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the Qur &apos;@@ an .
I read it , thought , questioned , doub@@ ted and ultimately believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow devotion , deep@@ ening with each reading of the Koran .
the beauty of rhythm sometimes brings me to weeping .
I recognize myself in it . I feel God knows me .
did you ever feel that someone perc@@ ei@@ ves you , you fully understand , and yet somehow loves ?
this is how it feels .
later I married and started like all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineer .
later , after my marriage , I had a child and basically lived the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream . &quot;
then that terrible morning came in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast , watched the screen and saw the word &quot; breaking news . &quot;
there was smoke , planes flew in buildings , people j@@ umped out of the buildings .
what was it ?
an accident ?
a technical mal@@ function ?
my shock quickly turned into rebellion .
why should one do such a thing ?
I changed the television channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; ... in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; Near east &quot; ... , &quot; ... Ji@@ had ... , &quot; ... sh@@ attered Mec@@ ca ! &quot;
Oh my God .
it has not only been attacked by my country , but in the N@@ u the deeds of others transformed me into a susp@@ ects .
on the same day we had to drive through the Mid@@ west of the USA to move to a new city and start the post@@ graduate studies .
I remember , as I ro@@ de in silence -- so deep it went into my seat , and I feared the first time to be recognized as Muslims .
we moved into our apartment this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be vig@@ il@@ ant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stay in well @-@ lit areas , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Do not stum@@ ble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed there all week .
then it was Friday that week -- the day Muslims gathered for prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again the warning : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I looked at the extensive coverage .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or by people thought for Muslims .
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who attacked this country attacked our country .
I have dealt with the anger of the people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain itself .
I don &apos;t have any questions , I love questions .
these are the accus@@ ations that are hard .
today , we can actually hear people say : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims .
when will we go ? &quot;
some people want to ban Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my community like a tumor in the body of the USA .
only the question arises : are we malign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
you know : a malign@@ ant tumour is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor is only observed under observation .
the alternatives are sen@@ sel@@ ess because the question is false .
Muslims are , like all other Americans , not a tumor in the body of the United States , but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , first resp@@ onder@@ s and Olympic athletes .
will the closure of mos@@ ques make America more secure ?
there will be some parking spaces , but do not stop the terror .
the regular visit of a mos@@ que leads to a more toler@@ ant view of people of other fai@@ ths and to show greater ci@@ vic participation .
and as a leader of the police in the Washington area , DC recently said : people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques .
they are radic@@ alised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer .
in the radic@@ alization process , it has been found that it begins online . first , the person is cut off from their community , even from their family so that the extrem@@ ist group believes that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and anyone who abh@@ ors their behavior and ideology is a tra@@ it@@ or or fallen away from faith .
if we want to prevent radic@@ alisation , we must stop people going to the mos@@ que .
some still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Koran .
as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human , I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group such as the IS .
but we would add to their imagination when one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x cl@@ one with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology in their &quot; holy book . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when one looks at them , they don &apos;t bo@@ ther what they read in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Scriptures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things into the scriptures .
an outstanding Ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she pre@@ tended to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was just the opposite . every priest with whom she spoke , brought her to silence and told her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring her into trouble .
inspired by nothing and something that had made sense to their anger , it was a major goal for the instrument@@ alization by extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised a solution .
this ima@@ m re@@ stores the connection with God and their church .
instead of acc@@ using them of anger , he showed her constructive ways for a real change in the world .
what she learned in the mos@@ que kept her from joining the IS .
this was an insight into how the Islam@@ opho@@ bia affects me and my family .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ?
one study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear we pass at least three things .
we rather accept an author@@ itarian system of government , con@@ formance , and prejudi@@ ce .
a study shows that if people present messages in which negative is reported about Muslims , they are more likely to attack military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not only an academic problem .
if you are looking at when the mood ab@@ oun@@ ds against Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two election periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected .
it can actually be a tool for manipul@@ ating the public to under@@ mine the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it first , but the toxic air of fear har@@ ms us all .
in the assignment of coll@@ ec@@ tives , it is not just about having to explain itself .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple living in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school .
De@@ ah was an ath@@ lete .
he was talented at the dental school , talented , promising ...
his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous man she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was start@@ led and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when has such a young man become an accomplished young man ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and his wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , murdered them , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an who was visiting in the afternoon . he did it in her apartment as in a execution after he posted remarks against Muslims on his Facebook page .
he shot at De@@ ah eight times .
fan@@ ati@@ cism may not only be im@@ moral but also deadly .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mos@@ que or were we safe at home ?
we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about what America we want to leave to our children : one that would control us by fear , or one in which we can freely exercise our religion .
we chose the mos@@ que .
with our son in the child &apos;s seat , we drove in silence , with high pressure to the mos@@ que .
I took it out , pulled off my shoes , went into the prayer hall , and what I saw allowed me to stop .
the hall was completely filled .
then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , because half of the assembled believers were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to assist us .
at this moment I have collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had preferred courage and compassion panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
are you going to be safe ?
or will you join those who think : we are better than those .
thank you very much .
thank you very much !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I wonder what you say to those who might say you &apos;re going to hold a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a mind@@ set with drau@@ ght , working in a pos@@ h think factory , so an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t be fo@@ ol@@ ed . I &apos;m completely normal .
I am not an exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
when one looks at Muslims around the world , and I did this with the largest ever conducted study on Muslims around the world , people want normal things .
they want wealth for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I &apos;m not an exception in any way .
when people seem like an exception to rule , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to the rule .
H@@ W : thank you very much . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what started as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is about to become a billion dollar business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the potential applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research institutions worldwide .
before air @-@ pack@@ et delivery penet@@ rated our social awareness , an autonomous fleet of aircraft engines at the Fra@@ c Centre in France built a tower of 1,@@ 500 bricks in front of the public in front of the audience . some years ago they began to fly with ropes .
by connecting , flight devices reach high speed and acceleration in the tigh@@ test space .
they can also build tow resili@@ ent structures .
they have learned to carry loads , deal with tur@@ mo@@ il and generally respond to natural laws .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of potential in autonomous flight .
in order for a system to function autonom@@ ously , it must be known coll@@ ectively where the mobile objects are located in the room .
in our laboratory at ETH Zurich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demo@@ s we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a branch of our laboratory .
there are no external cameras .
each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , determine calculations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external commands are available on the highest level e. g . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear starter ,
a flying machine trying to beat two flies with a flap .
like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in advancing , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all their variations .
in contrast to most star@@ ters , it can float , and thus has great advantages at start and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a down@@ side .
a limitation of rear @-@ star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ence like wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind this is that the aircraft doesn &apos;t matter in which position the optimal position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay .
during our research , we often present fundamental abstract questions that advance to the core of the matter .
one such question would be , for example , what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts , which together meet to hurt you .
decades ago , trained pilots were able to fly remote controlled aircraft , which had only two movable parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder .
recently we discovered that flying is working with just one .
this is the mon@@ osp@@ iner , the mechanically simplest , remote @-@ operated aircraft . it was invented recently .
it has only one moving part , a prop@@ eller ,
no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and cross ru@@ dder , no further actuators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller .
although it is mechanically simple , very much happens inside the interior , so that it can fly stable and can move everywhere in the room .
nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the tail @-@ star@@ ters . to get it to fly , I have to throw it right .
the chance to throw it right when all of you watch is small , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed last night .
if the mon@@ osp@@ lete is an exercise in cont@@ ent@@ ment , this machine is here , the Omni@@ cop@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is only symmet@@ rical .
that is why he is ambi@@ valent in his alignment .
as a result , he receives the extraordinary ability ,
move in space in all directions , no matter in which direction it is rot@@ ated or even rot@@ ated .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers .
some things can be seen in models , the rest is learned directly when flying .
let &apos;s look at it .
if flying machines should be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine consists of two separate twin prop@@ eller flying machines .
this rot@@ ates clock@@ wise
and the other counter @-@ clock@@ wise .
when you build them together they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
but if something goes wrong -- an engine or prop@@ eller falls off , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further if restricted .
we will now demonstrate this by making one half in@@ capacit@@ ated .
the last demonstration investig@@ ates synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression .
we took commercial micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where in space it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no upper limit .
hopefully this demonstration will motiv@@ ate you to think about new revolutionary ideas .
on Broadway , the especially safe machine will want to become a flying lamp shade .
of course , it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology .
for guys like us lies the reward in the development and the creative act .
it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that creative , clever creations are allowed to form them in such a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you very much .
1.3 billion years ago , in a very distant gal@@ axy , two black holes cir@@ cl@@ ed each other faster and faster , so they turned the mass of three suns in a tenth of a second into pure energy .
this short moment they ligh@@ tened more brigh@@ tly than all the stars in all gal@@ ax@@ ies of the entire universe known to us .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but their energy did not set them free in form of light --
finally , we speak of black holes .
the whole energy was released into space @-@ time fabric itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gravit@@ ational @-@ waves .
let &apos;s arrange the events at first .
3 billion years ago , a multi @-@ cell life on Earth was created .
since then , the earth has produced a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , people and -- God stands at -- even the Internet .
about 25 years ago , a group of especially cour@@ a@@ geous -- Ra@@ i Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver from Cal@@ tech -- decided to build a giant laser detector to search for gravit@@ ational waves , which are caused by colli@@ ding black holes .
most of them thought they were crazy .
but enough people recognized them as crazy geni@@ uses , so that the US National Science Foundation financed her idea .
after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Lig@@ o : the Laser Inter@@ fer@@ ometer @-@ gravit@@ ational @-@ waves observ@@ atory .
in the following period , the precision of the lig@@ o could be significantly increased , which greatly improved the recognition performance .
therefore it is called Advanced Lig@@ o .
at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor , persistent problems .
on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the commissioning of the detector , the gravit@@ ational @-@ waves ro@@ amed through the earth through the two colli@@ ding black holes .
they walked through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the good@@ bye to my death @-@ sick father .
in essence , these were the fruits of my life .
AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been examining gravit@@ ational waves of black holes and their transm@@ it@@ ters like lig@@ o . what are gravit@@ ational @-@ waves ?
a gravit@@ ational @-@ wave is a mu@@ til@@ ation in the structure of space and time .
when crossing the shaft , the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and put into the other .
lec@@ turers in courses on the theory of rel@@ ativity often lead to a truly alpine dance .
&quot; stretching and du@@ sting , stretching and du@@ sting . &quot;
the problem is that gravit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous .
on September 14th , for example , each of us was stretched and smo@@ ked by us when the waves were hit . the el@@ on@@ gation of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 .
that is , 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a followed by a 1 . that &apos;s why the Lig@@ o staff was ins@@ ane .
with a five @-@ kilomet@@ re laser detector , and that is already absurd , this length should be measured in less than a thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of a nucle@@ us . that &apos;s gr@@ ot@@ esque .
at the end of his classic text about gravity
&quot; &quot; &quot; described Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the technical difficulties in constructing these detectors are enormous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public all obstacles will certainly be overcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to say that Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I would like to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavel@@ ength that is much smaller than things around us : facial features , the size of your mobile phone .
this is quite practical , because you can create a picture or a map of things by perc@@ ei@@ ving the light around you from several points .
in sounds this is different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
that is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you :
about the face of your child .
instead we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and height , rhythm and volume to close the story behind it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now Alice is talking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and Bob interrup@@ ts them . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stupid Bob &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to gravit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we cannot make simple pictures of objects in space with them .
but by paying attention to changes in ampl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for Lig@@ o , the measured frequencies lie within the audi@@ ble range .
so if we convert wave patterns into sound , we can literally hear the universe .
to listen to the gravity can tell us a lot about the collision of two black holes , which my colleague Scott has occupied for quite a long time .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , simply chir@@ p : w@@ up@@ p !
turn the two bodies very quickly , you hear the same chir@@ p with an additional key change . that sounds so on : wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu !
it is a kind of movement vocabulary , im@@ printed in the wa@@ ve@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date at least I &apos;ll never forget -- doesn &apos;t Lig@@ o hear the following : &#91; Sur@@ render &apos;s sound &#93; somebody who knows what he has to listen to recognizes this as a sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with each 30 times solar mass , which rotate around as fast as the rods of your mixer .
AA : let &apos;s consider what this means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , circle a hundred times per second before they colli@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know about it because we have heard it .
this is the permanent significance of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o is pav@@ ing an entirely new way to explore the universe as it was never possible before .
on this path we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible .
much in space we can -- practically or basically -- do not see .
a super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ol@@ ean stars explo@@ de in super @-@ nov@@ as .
they are very useful . we have learned a lot about them all .
but the exciting physical processes happen at the core , hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never see through because these are op@@ a@@ que .
gravit@@ ational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass . the Big B@@ ang : I would like to explore the first minutes of the cosmos , but we will never see them since the Big B@@ ang is covered by its own tail lights .
with the help of gravit@@ ational @-@ waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and the most important thing : I am optim@@ istic that in all things we have never seen , which we will never see and of which we have no idea . things that we only discover by listening .
in fact , in the first run , Lig@@ o found things that we did not expect .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says on this subject : me : the type of stars that black holes produce how lig@@ o they watch are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies of pre@@ historic times . the black holes are so to speak the Sau@@ ri@@ erk@@ no@@ chen for our archaeological work .
Lig@@ o allows us a completely different view of the events in space , the emergence of the stars , and ultimately how we proce@@ eded out of this chaos .
AA : the challenge now is to be as bold as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and cir@@ cus of the cosmos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big B@@ ang itself ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thank you .
some time ago , I experim@@ ented with an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for one year I would say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was afraid of . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no matter if it made me nervous , upset me in unpleasant situations , I forced myself to say &quot; yes . &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
wanted to be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
do I want to start playing with the show ?
no , no , no , yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : exactly what I was afraid of , I removed my fear .
my fear of talking , my social fear -- pu@@ ff , away .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed my life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
but there was a certain yes that changed my life deeply to an un@@ expect@@ edly kind . it began with a question of my little ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the youngest , calls for all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for in@@ explic@@ able reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pussy , I need milk for my bill of be@@ ak &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she once asked me if I could play with her when I was just on the go . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
this yes was the beginning
a new attitude towards life in my family . from then on I bo@@ thered to always play with them as soon as you ask me . no matter what I &apos;m doing , or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I &apos;m very tired .
it has a magical effect on me , my children , on our family .
but it also has an amazing side effect : only recently I fully understood that the &quot; yes &quot; say to play with my children saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
I am a writer . I think things out , catch up with life .
job job .
no .
I am a Titan .
job job .
I create TV . I produce television .
I &apos;m doing TV , in great style .
in this TV season I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program into the world .
four TV programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
each broadcast offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
a new episode each nine days four shows , so every nine days 20 million dollars TV , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three programmes that are simultaneously in production , once four , 16 episodes : sc@@ andal , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours TV ,
$ 350 million for one season .
in America my TV series run one after the other on Thursday evening .
all over the world , my series in 256 regions run in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are con@@ sign@@ ments that I created myself , and not just produced , so still overhead . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and tell my stories .
four TV series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fires burning around the world .
do you know who does that still ?
no one , that &apos;s why I am a Titan .
job job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you .
I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
I tell you so that all of you who work so hard , whether you run a company , a country or a classroom , take me seriously when I talk about work to help you understand that I &apos;m not just cru@@ ising on the computer and f@@ anci@@ ful , and it &apos;s true when I say : I understand that it doesn &apos;t dream about dream job .
it &apos;s all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I &apos;m deep@@ ened in my work , there is no other feeling .
my work is creating a country out of nowhere .
it &apos;s like I set up troops as I painted on a canvas .
this is the case with a high sound , delivering a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all this at the same time .
I love working .
she is creative , mechanical , ti@@ ring and intoxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and reasonable . and the best part is the sum .
there is such a change in me when the work is going well .
a bu@@ zz@@ ing begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the hum@@ ming sounds like a busy road , I could go for it forever .
many people accept when I declare to them the bu@@ zz@@ ing that I am talking about writing that writing gives me joy .
don &apos;t you understand me wrong , you do it .
but the tot@@ als -- when I started to work and work and work , build , create and work together , I discovered this thing , this bu@@ zz@@ ing , this energy . the bu@@ zz !
the sum is more than writing .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing is action and activity . the bu@@ zz@@ ing is a drug .
the hum@@ ming is music . the hum@@ ming is light and air .
the hum@@ ming is the voice of God in my ear .
and if you have such a sum , then you cannot asp@@ ire differently than by size .
the feeling of not being able to strive for size , no matter what price .
this is called the tot@@ em .
or maybe it also means being a work@@ ah@@ olic .
perhaps it is called a genius .
perhaps it is ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I just know that I &apos;m not made for failure , and I just know that I love the hum@@ ming .
I just want to tell you , I &apos;m a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to question it .
to make it clear : the more successful I become , the more episodes , the more episodes , the more work there are , the more things are , the more things I write , the more I write history , the more expectations there are .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the land I created , the marathon , which I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound , the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the sum , the tot@@ als .
I like this hum@@ ming . I love the hum@@ ming .
I need the sum . I am the sum .
am I just this hum@@ ming ?
and then the bu@@ zz@@ ing stopped .
re@@ worked , over@@ loaded , exagger@@ ated , burned out .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing stopped .
now my three daughters are used to the truth that their mom@@ my is a single work type .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my m@@ um will not be there , but you can write to my N@@ anny . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and Emer@@ son says : &quot; kit@@ ten , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da country . &quot;
it is the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are baby ti@@ tan .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the bu@@ zz@@ ing ceased .
the hum@@ ming of the engine stopped .
I did not love my work any more . the engine was off .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing did not come back .
my hum@@ ming was broken .
I made the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ day , working weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing deleg@@ ating , a Titan sleeping doesn &apos;t give up , with all my heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no hum@@ ming .
in me was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a showcase @-@ Titan ,
everything was grey , I just had no fun anymore .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the bu@@ zz@@ ing and the bu@@ zz@@ ing I was .
so what do you do when what you do , the work you love suddenly fa@@ des ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know some may think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ha@@ y , stupid author Titan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know you do it , you are working , you love what you are doing , being a teacher , a ban@@ ker , being a mother , a painter , Bill Gates , you just love another and you know how the hum@@ ming feels when the bu@@ zz is stopped , who is you then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
if the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ?
and then my &quot; Southern States wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; asked me a question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m on the way outside , late on and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ um , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I already want to say no when two things become aware of me :
first , I must say yes to all and secondly , she didn &apos;t call me &quot; kit@@ ten . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she does not call anyone more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chat@@ ting &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when did that happen ?
I miss it when I &apos;m Titan and my bu@@ zz bet@@ ting , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ um , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we play and their sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read very dramatically from the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it &apos;s outstanding because my pain and panic , lon@@ el@@ iness and lack of frame , I can do nothing but to watch out .
I am focused .
I am quiet .
the land I create , the marathon , which I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they no longer exist .
everything that exists are sti@@ cky finger and hum@@ id kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons and the song in which it is about letting go , or whatever the girl gets in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot;
peace and simplicity are everywhere .
the air at this place is so close that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I &apos;m happy .
something in me dis@@ solves .
a mental door opens and an energy boost comes in .
and that doesn &apos;t happen immediately , but it happens it happens .
I feel it .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing comes back slowly .
no full volume , barely there , it &apos;s quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there .
not the bu@@ zz@@ ing , but a bu@@ zz@@ ing .
and now I feel as if I know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the working environment , the titanium dioxide , this is just the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , if I describe myself using con@@ sign@@ ments and television hours and how functioning my brain is , then I forgot what the real sum is .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing is not a force and it is not labour @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real hum@@ ming depends on love .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing is the current coming from the lust of life .
real hum@@ ming is self @-@ confidence and peace .
real hum@@ ming ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the tasks imposed , the expectation and the pressure .
the real bu@@ zz@@ ing is simple and original .
the real hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered to me the false words , because what God told me that I am a Titan ?
it &apos;s just love .
we all need a bit more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes .
I do this as a rule , so that I can free myself from all guilt as a work@@ ah@@ olic .
it is a law , I have no other choice . I have no other choice unless I want to hear the sum .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
playing is not up to me as I work .
the truth hur@@ ts ,
but I don &apos;t like playing it .
I always work , because I love it .
I prefer working at home than at home .
this admission is painful , because what a person is better to be than home ?
well , yes , I .
hon@@ estly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; --
I must have problems .
that I am very relaxed is none of them .
we rush around in the garden , forward and forth , back and forth .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we burst soap bubbles .
I feel mostly stiff , absent and confused .
I always use my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
my children show me how to live , and the hum@@ ming of the universe fills me .
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever stopped playing ?
you can also do it ! always say yes if your child wants to play with you .
perhaps you hold me nai@@ ve , for a day dre@@ aming .
you &apos;re right , but you can do it too !
they have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show character .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes , until they think they want to do something different .
it &apos;s wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ bug or cookie replaces me .
and talking my teen@@ age daughter for 15 minutes with me , I am mother of the year .
it is only 15 minutes , there is no need .
everyone can take 15 minutes a day , even on a bad @-@ day @-@ day !
15 minutes a piece !
no mobile phone , no washing , no distra@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner , the children are ready to bed .
but 15 minutes are inside !
my children are my well @-@ being , my world . it doesn &apos;t have to be the children . it is important to feel the hum@@ ming of having a place for peace .
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about pleasure ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general . &quot; &quot; &quot;
treat yourself to 15 minutes !
find out what you are doing well .
find it out and keep it .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I &apos;m leaving and I &apos;m winning . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in training when I wanted to out@@ do myself more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes a piece , why not allow for full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the bu@@ zz@@ ing came back in my spare time . the bu@@ zz@@ ing seems to return if I don &apos;t work .
working is not working without games .
it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office again . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul .
I like the sum , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I &apos;m not the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz is not me ... no more .
soap bubbles and sti@@ cky finger , dinner with friends .
this is my sum .
the hum@@ ming of life .
the hum@@ ming of love .
the sum of work is part of me , but just a part . and I am so thank@@ ful for that .
it is snap to me that I &apos;m a Titan . I &apos;ve never seen a Titan who plays a trip to Jerusalem .
I said yes to less work and more games .
and still I have everything under control . my brain is still working . my bon@@ fires are still burning .
the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the clearer my head .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the sum . the land I created , the marathon , which I run , the troops , the can@@ v@@ ases , the high sound , the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the other , the right sum : the bu@@ zz@@ ing of life .
the more I feel this sum , the more this unusual , lasting , bare and new attitude of life in me is wide . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel this sum , the more I know who I am .
I am a writer . I think things out , I &apos;m going to catch you to life .
this is part of the job , which means living his dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
for a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you very much .
I am a neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues , I have every day to do with human trage@@ dies .
I know how your life can change from one second to another after a serious stroke or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , in contrast to other body organs , has a very low capacity for self @-@ healing .
after a severe injury of the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , severe disability .
this is probably the reason why I was functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional Neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nervous functions by different surgical measures .
they have certainly heard of one of the most well @-@ known , the &quot; brain stimulation . &quot; in doing so , one im@@ planted a electrode deeply in the brain to influence the neur@@ ons &apos; circu@@ it@@ ry so that the neuro@@ logical function is improved .
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients suffering from Parkinson &apos;s disease , suffering from severe trem@@ ors and severe pain .
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation however does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion , we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to it .
with some help , the brain can help yourself .
history began 15 years ago .
at the time I was senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room .
I often provided patients with skull @-@ brain trauma .
they must imagine that the brain is s@@ wollen and the head pressure increases with skull @-@ brain trauma .
in order to save life , one has to reduce the pressure of the skull .
sometimes you have to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to use Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist to analyze the brain mass .
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
allowing cells to grow from one piece of fabric is comparable to very small children , which are taken out of your families .
you need to find proper nutrition , temperature , humidity and the environments to thri@@ ve them .
that &apos;s exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts Jean @-@ François was able to do it .
he saw this under his micro@@ scope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ? why ?
it looked exactly as a stem cell culture . with large green cells surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells .
perhaps you know from biology lessons that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells that can turn into each cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain .
it is surprising to get this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die , they are im@@ mortal .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they par@@ ted slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
so we saw a new , strange cell population that looked like stem cells but beha@@ ved differently .
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ bl@@ ec@@ or@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they comprise 4 % of our brain cattle cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
at the stage of the fet@@ us they care for the folding of the brain .
but why are they going to get us ?
we do not know this .
we believe that they are taking part in the healing of the brain as we find them close to brain injuries in higher concentrations .
but this is not so certain .
one thing is clear , however -- of these cells we got our stem cells .
we stand in front of a potential cell source that allows brain healing .
we had to prove this .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean @-@ François did .
and then mark them in color to be able to trace them in the brain .
in the last step , we re @-@ elected them at the acceptance test of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ t .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we reim@@ plant@@ ate these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we reim@@ plant@@ ate the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ ger we were able to work with apes .
in the first scenario , we reim@@ pl@@ ained the cells in a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely , as if they were removed again , they go back home . the space is already occupied , they are not needed there , so they disappear .
in the second scenario we put an injury to and reim@@ plant@@ ants exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew up to mature neur@@ ons .
here you can see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that have been re @-@ planted .
the evidence they show are these little points . these are the cells that we dy@@ e in vitro , in culture .
of course we could not stop here .
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained apes with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take pellets from a tray .
they made it very good .
when they reached a stable level of skill , we injured the motor @-@ motor range in the motor Cor@@ tex .
ther@@ eu@@ pon the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they couldn &apos;t move their hand any more .
just as it would happen in people , they spontaneously recovered to a certain degree , just like after a stroke .
patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover to a certain degree , just like the monkey .
when we were sure that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left side you see the monkey , who recovered spontaneously .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from prior to injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
now see , when we reim@@ plant@@ ated the cells : the same monkey , two months after the reim@@ plant@@ ation .
I can tell you that was also very exciting for us .
since that time we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can freeze it and use it later .
we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still to implant them in humans .
I really hope that I can show you soon how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
thank you very much .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that just now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can do that . &quot;
I definitely .
of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials on humans .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . proceeding from these great results , one has to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through this type of studies .
BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it will take until someone can come to hospital and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial .
will the authority allow us to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to choose the patient to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
then you have to apply this to a multi @-@ centric study .
first you need to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting TED and that you have told us about it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider them as self @-@ evident .
we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it is in reality , but as an inventory of our society .
we tend to consider them as imm@@ utable ti@@ d@@ iness .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
that is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and an impressive growth , while politics is completely un@@ democratic .
in fact , democracy is d@@ wind@@ ling with us , in Europe .
at the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- I was un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally made clear to me as finance minister in the Euro@@ group that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- could not influence the austerity programs realized in Greece .
at that moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , or the Communist Party of China , or some of my friends , who repeatedly told me that democracy would be aboli@@ shed if it would change anything .
at this point I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy .
I ask you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group will have a wrong belief , we could save democracy , but that we need a true and defensive democracy .
because without democracy our societies are mas@@ ked , our future ble@@ ak up and our great new technologies are wa@@ sted .
I would like to remind you of an interesting contradiction which currently threat@@ ens our economies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twin summit parad@@ ox . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a peak is known to you . you know and recognize him as the mountain of debt , which th@@ rows its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the debt mountain ,
but few recognise his twin .
a mountain of unused cash , which belongs to the wealthy econom@@ ists and corporations , which , however , are too anxi@@ ous to invest in where it would be productive and income , with which one could take away the debt mountain and also produce all the things that humanity needs , for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past three months , 3,@@ 4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars were invested in the United States , England and the euro@@ zone , in all the wealth producing goods , such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on and so on .
3.4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars sounds like a lot of money until it compar@@ es to the $ 1 tri@@ l@@ lion of US dollars , which at the same time lag@@ ged in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing was done except stock exchanges and rise in real estate prices .
thus debt and un@@ productive capital are the twin peaks that are not compensated by the usual market mechanisms .
the result are stagn@@ ant wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the US , Japan and Europe unemployed , and consequently a low macro@@ economic demand that advoc@@ ates the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors , which , like in a continuous loop , advoc@@ ates the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors , which , in fear , the prophecy of the miracle may be true that his son would kill him if he grew up ,
un@@ intentionally causes the circumstances to cause that O@@ edi@@ pus k@@ ills him .
this is my shar@@ k with capitalism !
all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , develop human talents and especially finance all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth .
so is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue , what do we understand under democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy closed too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
however , it would be a mistake to reduce the significance of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy on account of these exclu@@ sions .
the decisive factor in the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that it with@@ drew the working poor , and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but more importantly and decisi@@ vely that they gave them the right to political co @-@ determination with the same bal@@ lot of votes in matters of state issues .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy hasn &apos;t lasted for a long time --
like a candle that shines brigh@@ tly , it is burned out quickly .
however , our present liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies have not their roots in ancient Athens ,
but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious Revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which was ultimately a statute for rulers .
for liberal democracy first appeared when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics while the economy -- that is , the world of corporations -- became a democratic zone .
in today &apos;s demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time when this separation of politics and economy began , there has been a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two , by gradually mig@@ rating politics and em@@ as@@ cul@@ ating it .
are you wondering why politicians are no longer as they used to be ?
it is not due to a degeneration of its DNA .
it is because today it is possible to be in the government and still not in power because the power is mig@@ rated from politics into the economy and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my sh@@ arks with capitalism .
when you think about it , it &apos;s like a herd of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es that sustain@@ ably under@@ mines the animals they feed on , that they end up star@@ ving at the end .
similarly , it is with the economy that has har@@ med policy so far that it hur@@ ts itself through the self @-@ created economic crisis itself . the power of corporations is growing , political goods are depreci@@ ated , political goods rise , the macro@@ economic demand falls , and the directors of the corporations are too frigh@@ tened to invest the cash of their businesses .
the more successful capitalism drives the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; out of democracy , the higher the twin peaks become , and the greater the waste of human labour and the prosperity of mankind .
if this is true , it is obvious that we have to re@@ unite politics and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; keeps control , as in ancient Athens , aside from exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
by the way , this is not a new idea .
the Marxist Left had this idea 100 years ago and it did not go very well .
the doctrine of the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only reg@@ ain a position like in ancient Athens without creating new types of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is one solution : to aboli@@ sh the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ wage workers through automation and robots .
the problem is that so long economy and politics are separate areas , automation makes the twin peaks higher , the waste more subli@@ me , and the social conflicts more deeply , as it is -- already very soon , as I believe -- in countries like China .
so we have to re@@ organize the economy and re@@ unite the areas of business and politics , and take care that we will democr@@ ati@@ ze the re@@ unified field , otherwise we end up in a path@@ ological surveillance hyper@@ auto@@ cracy , which makes the film &quot; Matrix &quot; appear as a documentary .
so the question is not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that it has produced --
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to that in &quot; matrix , &quot; or by something similar to society in &quot; Star Tre@@ k , &quot; in which people serve human beings and people put their energy into the exploration of the universe , or into a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ eni@@ ans &quot; A@@ gor@@ a , &quot; in long talks the meaning of life .
I think we can be optim@@ istic .
so what would it be like , how could it look like having this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia instead of &quot; Matrix &quot; similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples .
in the field of companies : please introduce a capital market in which you earn money while you work and in which your capital will follow you from one office to the next , from one company to the next , and the company -- no matter what you are working at - is property of those currently working in the company .
then all revenues from capital and revenues originate and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ taken .
no distinction more between those who belong to the enterprises , but who do not work in it , and employees who work there , whom the company does not belong . no de@@ af more between capital and labour , no big gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no to@@ wering twin peaks .
in the field of global political economy : please briefly imagine that our national currencies would have a free fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interests of all humanity .
imagine that the whole world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the cosmos , &quot; in units of &quot; Cos@@ mos &quot; -- and each government pays the sum equivalent to the trade deficit or net income of the respective country into a common fund .
&quot; &quot; &quot; imagine that this fund inv@@ ests in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John Ma@@ yn@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference from 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
today we have them , in particular against the background of a re@@ unified policy and economy .
the world I describe is at the same time liberal in which they fav@@ ored privileged individuals , and Marxist , because they have buried the separation of capital and labour in the du@@ st@@ bin of history , and Key@@ nesi@@ an , global Key@@ nesi@@ an .
but above all else , it is a world in which we can imagine real democracy .
will we awaken in such a world
&quot; &quot; &quot; or will we sink into a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
the answer depends on how we decide politically .
it is in our hands , and we do it better democratic .
thank you .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself as Liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if any of what I have just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant .
the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economics is ... Do we not do this , technological development will generate such a massive decline in aggregate demand , which is called Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers as &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot;
by transferring this crisis from one part of the world to the next , as we are currently experiencing , it will not only destabili@@ se our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is small .
if this analysis is true , then Marx is quite relevant ,
just like Hay@@ ek , that &apos;s why I am a liberal Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and that is why I am completely un@@ happy .
BG : indeed , and now we are .
Y@@ V : if you &apos;re not crazy , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein who said this . BG : in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you have clearly said what you think of the West &apos;s view in China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies , we have the appearance of democracy .
as I said in my speech , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most of it plays out -- the sphere of economy -- is a completely democratic zone .
in some ways , if I may say so pro@@ voc@@ ative , China is similar to the England of the 19th century .
for -- remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- that is a mistake , historically considered .
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , such as John Stu@@ art Mill --
he was particularly scep@@ tical about the democratic development .
what we can observe now in China is similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
China is now pre@@ ten@@ ding to do what the West has done in the 19th century , sm@@ ells tremend@@ ously according to hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experience as Finance Minister of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I thought that &apos;s coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later to the first half of the year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the Eurozone ,
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; namely to say good@@ bye to the compl@@ ac@@ ency , and the permanent den@@ ial that a massive fault line went through the euro@@ zone , and continues to be mas@@ sively threatened by the development of the whole European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had the opportunity , based on Greek proposal -- by the way , the first proposal revealed this den@@ ial --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro area , within the European group , have chosen den@@ ial . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know what &apos;s coming .
that is the experience from the Soviet Union --
if you try to keep an economic system that is not viable to live by political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism , it will perhaps be delayed for a while , but if the change occurs it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive .
BG : what change do you expect ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro@@ zone has no future if we do not change its construction .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- seriously ...
if there is a finance minister or minister , who is in office after 6 months , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , he claims he has made no mistake , then this is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for an extension of the debt programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest on the len@@ ders &apos; sides to find a common solution .
but that didn &apos;t exist .
they merely wanted to bring our government down because they did not want to deal with the distor@@ tions running through the euro@@ zone .
they did not want to admit that they had a disa@@ strous programme in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
it is worse than during the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no one from the Troika of the financi@@ ers imposed on us this policy was : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive tone of the conversations , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe .
my biggest fear is that the euro@@ zone does not survive .
for if it does not survive , the released centri@@ fu@@ gal forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union .
this will not be disa@@ strous for Europe alone , but for the entire global economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we allow ourselves to embar@@ k on the path of a post @-@ modern 1930 , what appears to me , it will also be det@@ ri@@ mental to the future of Europeans and non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope that you are wrong at this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you for being at TED .

he is 47 years old , slim , has a hair@@ style hair@@ style and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; movies , TV , technique , tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and the content that Amazon will produce .
of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought industry .
there are so many TV series that Roy can &apos;t select any one .
he must find shows which are very , very good .
in other words , he must find shows located quite right on this corner .
this curve is the evaluation distribution of over 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this review gets .
if your show is rated at nine and above , it is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
these are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire , &quot; all the shows that are addic@@ tive , where after watching a season , your brain asks : &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
on the left side , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roy Price does not worry about getting on the left side of the curve because I think you need special intelligence to sign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he makes more thoughts about the middle ev@@ asion , the average television -- the shows , which are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t inspire .
so he must make sure that he is really on the right side .
the print is present , and of course it &apos;s the first time Amazon makes something so Roy Price does not want to risk anything .
he wants to create successes .
he requires guaranteed success , so he holds a competition .
he takes a lot of ideas for TV shows and sel@@ ects eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online , where they can watch for free .
and if Amazon gives out for nothing , do you access , right ?
millions of spectators watch these episodes .
but they don &apos;t know they are being watched while watching these shows .
they are watched by Roy and his team who record everything .
you collect when you start the show , when you pause , which parts one ski@@ ps or looks again .
you collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce using these data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , they collect the data , process them and from them the answer is , and this is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com for four Republi@@ can US Sen@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they made this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn &apos;t so good .
it &apos;s just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House ends at 7.5 -- so somewhat above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked .
about the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always on the look@@ out to find it a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it different .
instead of holding a contest , he and his team have watched the existing data on the Net@@ fli@@ x viewer , so the reviews they give the shows , their course , what shows they like , etc .
then they use these data to find out these little details about the audience : what shows they like , which producers , what actors .
when they had all the parts together , they entered a venture and decided not to make a sit@@ com for four sen@@ ators but a drama series about a sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go .
of course , the question now is : what &apos;s going on here ?
one has two very competitive , data sealed companies .
they combine these many data and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because logic somehow says that it should work with everything .
if you collect millions of data , for a decision you meet , then you should make a good decision .
you have 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
you optimize it by using very powerful computers .
the least thing you can expect is good television , isn &apos;t it ?
if data analysis does not work , then this is a bit frigh@@ tening because we live in a time where we have more and more access to statistics to make serious choices , far beyond television .
does anyone know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
nobody . OK , that &apos;s good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope no one in this room ever comes into contact with this software . come in touch with it , you are in prison .
if someone is in prison here in the US and asks for release , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dis@@ mis@@ sal is made or not .
just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it is decided whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate television , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always produces the best results . this is not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
even the most experienced companies are wrong .
yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes .
in 2009 , Google announced that they can predict violations of flu , the bad way -- by analy@@ sing data from Google searches .
it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation . the success cul@@ min@@ ated in a publication in the journal Nature .
it worked fine , year around year , until it didn &apos;t work anymore ,
and nobody could say why .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it simply didn &apos;t work , this was once again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of publication in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nature &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the data processing companies like Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
in spite of all these errors , data streams down into decisions of life -- at work , legal enforcement , medicine .
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded genetics -- an area where some very smart people are un@@ think@@ able to use many data to make serious choices as the decision for a cancer treatment
over the years I have realized a few patterns about the difference between successful decisions using data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
if you have to solve a complex problem , basically do two things :
first dis@@ assemble this problem into its parts so you can analyze the items ; as a second , put the items together again to make a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : taking apart and putting together again .
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help disman@@ tle a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to assemble the parts and then come to a decision .
there is another tool for this and we all possess it : our brain .
if there is something in which the brain is good , it is necessary to put parts and pieces together again , even if the information is incomplete , in order to get a good decision -- especially when it is the brain of an expert .
that &apos;s why I think Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and mind where they also belong in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience why they would otherwise have not been able to do . but the decision on how to take all these parts together and make a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; is not in the data .
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team made this decision for this show , which meant that they had a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon , on the other hand , did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions , first as they compete for TV ideas , then when they selected &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision because they could always say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is telling us the dates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data is helpful for better decisions , but I think things are going wrong when data start controlling our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and to not forget that , this device is quite useful .
many of you will ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or No question , you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most likely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- right here at this moment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I will turn it out later with a technical demo .
so far I &apos;ve made some decisions in my life , where I should have listened to the ball in hin@@ d@@ sight .
but , as you know , of course , if you have the data available , you want to replace it with something much more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
in the end , it &apos;s up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn .
and I feel this very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data it still pays to make decisions , be an expert in what you do and take risks .
because in the end it is not the data , but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve .
thank you very much .
