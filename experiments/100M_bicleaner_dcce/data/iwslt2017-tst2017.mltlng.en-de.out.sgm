<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before anyone had heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacularly that the NSA has illegally listened to telephones of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But there is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation, in which the CIA gave Iran literally drafts for a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If that sounds crazy, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who didn't like the chapter?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years, the government has determined against Risen and called upon him to call his supposed sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this turn, he became a symbol of the government's pattern of condemning whistleblowers and spy journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the First Constitution, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right if media does not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the courageous ones they are revealing.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government knocked at Risen, he did something that many courageous reporters had already done before him: he refused and said that he would rather go to jail.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk of going to jail.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the trial, something extraordinary happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, although they have been indications for years that it would be essential in their case, the government's demands were dropped.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring, reporters and sources can hide more and less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of failing and bringing tears to the testimony, this could also do its digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators, without his consent, have secretly bought his telephone lines,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just as his e-mail data, financial and bank information, his credit journey, and even travel cards with the list of his flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information, they found evidence that they used to denounce Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA's whistleblower and a rupture.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect whistleblowers. but instead, the judiciary has condemned more than all US governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government classifies too much of its work as a secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article on national security was the result of a whistleblower going to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">So we put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional proposition because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on everyone.</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as the government's technology allows to circumvent the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">And they can do this from the moment they are in contact, rather than in hindsight, witness.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today there is communication software, which has not yet existed when Risen had written his book, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such technology is SecureDrop, an open-source transmission system for whistleblowers, which was originally developed by the Internet world famous Aaron Swartz, and is now being developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation in which I work.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an email, go to a news site, just like the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send information, just like with any usual contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server where only the respective news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government cannot obtain more information secretly, and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is but only a small part of the whole in order to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments around the world are constantly developing new spying technologies that endanger all of us.</seg>
<seg id="38">It is important to us to ensure that not only technology experts such as Edward Snowden have an opportunity to offend misdeeds. it is equally important that we protect the next whistleblower,</seg>
<seg id="39">Who knows about grievances in the supply of soldiers and wants to report from overcrowded hospitals. or the next environmental staff who warns against the contaminated water of Flint. or a wall street insider that warns us about the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">After all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes, but to protect our constitutional rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness to hide in tax havens [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.] this week we were asked by Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.] this week we were sent by news about a leak of 11 million documents of the Mosch Fonseca law firm based in Panama.</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">We get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers come to companies like Moselle Fonseca and say: "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up this?"</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the emails, the exchange of messages, how the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already resulted in very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's Prime Minister resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has mail box companies in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is alleged that a track of $2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin, a close friend of childhood days, a famous cellist.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others who wait nervous for the next release, and the next documents revealed.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now that sounds like the plot of an agent or a John-Grisham-novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems crying away from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we do that?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their fortune in tax havens and not pay all their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And this concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">Across the globe, media and leading politicians are discussing how secret tax havens are used by some few to hide and veil their assets -- something that we have been discussing and covering for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people seem to be very confusing this whole world, and it is hard to understand how these tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine it like a Matryoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">So you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these buildings.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what it is." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">"" "" "" "probably because there have been no prominent Americans in these revelations, this scandal." ""</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not that there are no wealthy Americans hiding their fortunes in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">But because of the principle behind these tax havens, Mossack Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a data leak from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, some U.S. states require less information to provide less information to establish a company than to get a library card.</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of intransparency in the USA allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed scammers to rip off especially vulnerable arms.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covert investigator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator was an African minister who wanted to bring suspicious money to the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">"" "" "" "we really shocked us that everyone up to one lawyer made proposals to our investigators how to transfer his money." ""</seg>
<seg id="76">None of these lawyers appealed to us as clients, and of course no one was given money to anybody. but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer who has submitted suggestions to our hidden investigator.</seg>
<seg id="79">It's not about a single top politician, involved in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">It is about how the system works, through which corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability are established.</seg>
<seg id="81">And in order to cope with this, we need to change the rules of the game.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior more difficult." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">It may sound quite absurd as if we could not do anything about it; as if nothing had ever changed; as if there will always be the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a born optimist, I see that something has begun to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">Over the past few years we have seen violations of more transparency concerning the owners of companies.</seg>
<seg id="86">The subject took political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then the EU has been collecting in central registers at the national level, who is really behind companies in Europe, and who controls it.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the uncomfortable facts is that the US is lagging behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have introduced a draft bill in the two parliamentarians, but this does not make progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how these Panama disclosure, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us with Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind bogus firms.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need leaders in the economy who get up and say:" "" "transparency is not good for business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use them to end this kind of intransparency by law." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">"" "" "" "together, we can finally stop the intransparency that now allows this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering." ""</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story of how I almost kidnapped and landed in the trunk of a red Mazda.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I finished my design studies, I made a backyard sale.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda remained standing and looked at my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my art works.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a roadtrip across the country. afterwards he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me about how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "as we paid the bill, I made the mistake asking him:" "" "where do you sleep tonight?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">"" "he made the whole thing worse:" "" "I don't know yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought, "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What am I doing now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just met him! he says he would go to peace corps, but I don't know if he really plans it. I don't want to land in the trunk of a Mazda!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small boot!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "then I heard:" "" "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "a voice in my head said:" "" "uh, how please?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I was lying in bed, I gazed at the ceiling and thought, "Oh man! what did I get there?"</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild stranger sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">"" "what if he is crazy?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I went out of bed, sliding on toes to the door and closing my bedroom door.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art he bought from me today hangs in his classrooms. he is a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it completely changed my point of view.</seg>
<seg id="121">Maybe the people who were sold to me as a stranger in childhood were actually friends who were waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">To house people on my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress with them.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's take a leap, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I'm unemployed, almost broke, my roommate is moving and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can create fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote to my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I thought about how we could earn something about it. our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk including a mattress and each morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and created so "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floor.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it great, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure our cheese-ham-omelets tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them through the whole city. when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle, Brian and I stopped.</seg>
<seg id="134">Did we just discover that we were able to find new friends at the same time and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came rolling.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if we could make it a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">This is how we presented ourselves to the investors: "we want to create a website where people post public images of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the type of rooms whose doors are closed when you visit.</seg>
<seg id="139">Via the Internet, they can invite strangers to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">That will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited for the missile to ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they do not.</seg>
<seg id="143">Nobody who is still in comfort would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why? why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have a problem, you're thinking about the things you can do well. we could design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Fine Arts we learned that design is much more than just look and feel -- it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create an immense trust between people who had never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design afford such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a sample of what degree of confidence we aspire.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hands.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like you to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Give your unlocked phone to your left sitting next mate.</seg>
<seg id="157">This silent touch of panic you can sense now -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">The only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the unlocked phone of a stranger in his hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">This is how most guests feel when they stay somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just like that, who actually has Al Gores mobile now?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you announce on Twitter that he is channeling for president's office?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the cell phones.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I want to tell you about some of the discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail of this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor had first presented himself with his name; if he had told where he came from, how his dog or his children would be called?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you would have 150 testimonials that all say: "he really can hold tightly locked phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">For a well thought-out feedback system, confidence boosts confidence.</seg>
<seg id="173">In the beginning we did some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was difficult for people to have negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">In the end, we decided to wait until both hosts and guest had given their reviews before we put them on-line.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how likely it is that people trust each other, depending on how much they are about age and place of residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">Not surprisingly, we rely on people most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It becomes exciting when you add a person's call -- in our case by judgements.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three ratings, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if you have more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good call stands out commonalities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">In addition, we learned that trust is dependent on how much you give away.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">If you tell too little, like "Hi!," you don't get an answer.</seg>
<seg id="189">"" "it tells too much, for example:" "" "I have problems with my mother" -- -- the request is rather not accepted. "" "</seg>
<seg id="190">So there is an optimal degree of openness, e.g. "great works of art in your home! I'm doing a holiday with my family."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can we create it with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text. we also give tips on which topics you should write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we didn't reckon was the great amount of people who were more than willing to dismantle these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you can see how many people are using our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: incredible luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second, the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third, a demand that had not been met before.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us, the business is going very well.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times when not everything goes smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have not allowed parties to celebrate or ravaged apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have let guests stand in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked with the customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I was at the forefront when trust was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it hurts when I just think about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that you hear in the voice of callers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, only a fraction of the 123 million overnight stays had a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">For people rightly trust each other.</seg>
<seg id="210">If trust works, it can be miraculous.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is its assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"" "" "" "perfect home for travelers who tend to heart attacks because of sitting activities." ""</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who save one's life even though they don't know one.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive to the hospital in your own car when you die, and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want you to feel lonely, they bring books by.</seg>
<seg id="220">They let one stay even longer without calculating the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">Of course, not every stay will expire.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled over this term for the first time, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with money transactions take place?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is about economic commerce.</seg>
<seg id="227">"" "but it is not just the" "" "rental industry" "", "the thing is not justified." ""</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">Humans open a part of themselves, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">When you travel nowadays, it is easy to compare with fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">But what if travelling would be a rich buffet of local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if in any place you visited, a group of residents would wait to fill a thoroughly and show one at a pub crawl area of which you have never heard;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would arrange apartments from the ground up to togetherness?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the idea of shared participation?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities which enable us society and relationships instead of loneliness and isolation.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korea's capital Seoul, this project has already begun.</seg>
<seg id="240">Were now offered residents. students who were looking for a place to stay,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were taught to people whose children were drafted. incubator programs were launched,</seg>
<seg id="242">To finance new start-ups in the Share Economy. via our platform alone, 785,000 people will be guest in 191 countries overnight in a foreign or even host.</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea does not seem to be as crazy as it was taught us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We didn't reinvent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality was already there before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did it just work?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from luck and timing we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find it amazing,</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">Each time I have to think about it when a Mazda drives past me.</seg>
<seg id="253">Of course, we know that design cannot solve every problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us, if it had this great influence, I wonder what we can use in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think when you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or oppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in the security check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I do not blame you for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media represent people who look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">One study found that 80% of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show that the Americans think most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people don't talk to their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For those who have never met a Muslim: it's great to get to know you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee maker -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A fitness-fitness fanatic,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not like Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I wasn't born like that.</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to do so.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17, I decided to outen me.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as a homosexual person, like some of my friends, but as a Muslim. I decided to wear the Hijab, my head cover.</seg>
<seg id="277">"" "my feminist friends were horrified:" "" "why do you suppress yourself?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="278">The funny thing was: back then it was a feminist declaration of independence, compared to the pressure that I was 17 years old to adapt to a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only adopted the faith of my parents passively.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have wrestled with the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, thought, questioned, doubted and ultimately believed.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was trust and slow devotion, deepening with each reading of the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of rhythm sometimes brings me to weeping.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Did you ever feel that someone perceives you, you fully understand, and yet somehow loves?</seg>
<seg id="287">This is how it feels.</seg>
<seg id="288">Later I married and started like all the good Egyptians, my career as an engineer.</seg>
<seg id="289">Later, after my marriage, I had a child and basically lived the "Egyptian-American Dream."</seg>
<seg id="290">Then that terrible morning came in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">I sat in my kitchen, had breakfast, watched the screen and saw the word "breaking news."</seg>
<seg id="293">There was smoke, planes flew in buildings, people jumped out of the buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was it?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical malfunction?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock quickly turned into rebellion.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should one do such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="299">I changed the television channel and heard:... "Muslim terrorists..."... in the name of Islam... "..." Near east "...,"... Jihad..., "... shattered Mecca!"</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">It has not only been attacked by my country, but in the Nu the deeds of others transformed me into a suspects.</seg>
<seg id="302">On the same day we had to drive through the Midwest of the USA to move to a new city and start the postgraduate studies.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember, as I rode in silence -- so deep it went into my seat, and I feared the first time to be recognized as Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved into our apartment this night, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">"" "and then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said:" "" "be vigilant," "" "Be careful," "" "stay in well-lit areas," "" "Do not stumble." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed there all week.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday that week -- the day Muslims gathered for prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">"" "and again the warning:" "" "do not go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="309">I looked at the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">The feelings were understandably unfiltered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or by people thought for Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really fire attacks on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something did not feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people who attacked this country attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I have dealt with the anger of the people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to constantly explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">I don't have any questions, I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">These are the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Today, we can actually hear people say: "there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we go? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to ban Muslims and close mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my community like a tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">Only the question arises: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: a malignant tumour is removed as a whole and a benign tumor is only observed under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are senseless because the question is false.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims are, like all other Americans, not a tumor in the body of the United States, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, first responders and Olympic athletes.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques make America more secure?</seg>
<seg id="331">There will be some parking spaces, but do not stop the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visit of a mosque leads to a more tolerant view of people of other faiths and to show greater civic participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as a leader of the police in the Washington area, DC recently said: people are actually not radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">In the radicalization process, it has been found that it begins online. first, the person is cut off from their community, even from their family so that the extremist group believes that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and anyone who abhors their behavior and ideology is a traitor or fallen away from faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalisation, we must stop people going to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group like the IS establishes its brutality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As a Muslim, as a mother, as a human, I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group such as the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to their imagination when one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux clone with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology in their "holy book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"" "but when one looks at them, they don't bother what they read in their" "" "Holy Scriptures." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that lets them read these things into the scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she pretended to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said the problem was just the opposite. every priest with whom she spoke, brought her to silence and told her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring her into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Inspired by nothing and something that had made sense to their anger, it was a major goal for the instrumentalization by extremists who promised a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This imam restores the connection with God and their church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accusing them of anger, he showed her constructive ways for a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque kept her from joining the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight into how the Islamophobia affects me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day, on our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we fear we pass at least three things.</seg>
<seg id="359">We rather accept an authoritarian system of government, conformance, and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study shows that if people present messages in which negative is reported about Muslims, they are more likely to attack military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not only an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you are looking at when the mood abounds against Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up to the Iraq war and during two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool for manipulating the public to undermine the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel it first, but the toxic air of fear harms us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the assignment of collectives, it is not just about having to explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple living in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was an athlete.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was talented at the dental school, talented, promising...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, most generous man she knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was startled and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"" "" "" "when has such a young man become an accomplished young man?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="375">Just a few weeks after the visit of Suzanne with her brother and his wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, murdered them, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan who was visiting in the afternoon. he did it in her apartment as in a execution after he posted remarks against Muslims on his Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="376">He shot at Deah eight times.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanaticism may not only be immoral but also deadly.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or were we safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision, because it was about what America we want to leave to our children: one that would control us by fear, or one in which we can freely exercise our religion.</seg>
<seg id="382">We chose the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the child's seat, we drove in silence, with high pressure to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took it out, pulled off my shoes, went into the prayer hall, and what I saw allowed me to stop.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, because half of the assembled believers were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came not to attack us, but to assist us.</seg>
<seg id="387">At this moment I have collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had preferred courage and compassion panic and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose at the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Are you going to be safe?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you join those who think: we are better than those.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you very much!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have hit a nerve.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I wonder what you say to those who might say you're going to hold a TEDTalk, a mindset with draught, working in a posh think factory, so an exception and not the rule.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say, don't be fooled. I'm completely normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">I am not an exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">I am as usual as it is allowed.</seg>
<seg id="402">When one looks at Muslims around the world, and I did this with the largest ever conducted study on Muslims around the world, people want normal things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want wealth for the family, they want work and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I'm not an exception in any way.</seg>
<seg id="405">When people seem like an exception to rule, then often the rule has been broken, and they are not the exception to the rule.</seg>
<seg id="406">HW: thank you very much. Dalia Mogahed.</seg>
<seg id="407">What started as a platform for hobbyists is about to become a billion dollar business.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the potential applications for commercial drones. this is made possible in research institutions worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air-packet delivery penetrated our social awareness, an autonomous fleet of aircraft engines at the Frac Centre in France built a tower of 1,500 bricks in front of the public in front of the audience. some years ago they began to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">By connecting, flight devices reach high speed and acceleration in the tightest space.</seg>
<seg id="411">They can also build tow resilient structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to carry loads, deal with turmoil and generally respond to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of potential in autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">In order for a system to function autonomously, it must be known collectively where the mobile objects are located in the room.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zurich, we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a branch of our laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, determine calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "external commands are available on the highest level e. g." "" "start" "" "and" "" "land" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called rear starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A flying machine trying to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starters, it is efficient in advancing, much more efficient than helicopters in all their variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most starters, it can float, and thus has great advantages at start and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a downside.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of rear-starters is that they react sensitively to turbulence like wind gusts.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind this is that the aircraft doesn't matter in which position the optimal position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often present fundamental abstract questions that advance to the core of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question would be, for example, what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts, which together meet to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago, trained pilots were able to fly remote controlled aircraft, which had only two movable parts: a propeller and a stern rudder.</seg>
<seg id="435">Recently we discovered that flying is working with just one.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the monospiner, the mechanically simplest, remote-operated aircraft. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only one moving part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No flaps, hinges and cross rudder, no further actuators or control surfaces, only one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanically simple, very much happens inside the interior, so that it can fly stable and can move everywhere in the room.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the tail-starters. to get it to fly, I have to throw it right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The chance to throw it right when all of you watch is small, so I'll show you a video that was filmed last night.</seg>
<seg id="442">If the monosplete is an exercise in contentment, this machine is here, the Omnicopter with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why he is ambivalent in his alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">As a result, he receives the extraordinary ability,</seg>
<seg id="447">Move in space in all directions, no matter in which direction it is rotated or even rotated.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some things can be seen in models, the rest is learned directly when flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's look at it.</seg>
<seg id="451">If flying machines should be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine consists of two separate twin propeller flying machines.</seg>
<seg id="453">This rotates clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other counter-clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you build them together they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">But if something goes wrong -- an engine or propeller falls off, the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further if restricted.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate this by making one half incapacitated.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration investigates synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took commercial micro-quadcopter -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where in space it is and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully this demonstration will motivate you to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">On Broadway, the especially safe machine will want to become a flying lamp shade.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For guys like us lies the reward in the development and the creative act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that creative, clever creations are allowed to form them in such a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="469">1.3 billion years ago, in a very distant galaxy, two black holes circled each other faster and faster, so they turned the mass of three suns in a tenth of a second into pure energy.</seg>
<seg id="470">This short moment they lightened more brightly than all the stars in all galaxies of the entire universe known to us.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But their energy did not set them free in form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">Finally, we speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The whole energy was released into space-time fabric itself and the universe exploded in gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let's arrange the events at first.</seg>
<seg id="476">3 billion years ago, a multi-cell life on Earth was created.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then, the earth has produced a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, people and -- God stands at -- even the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, a group of especially courageous -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from Caltech -- decided to build a giant laser detector to search for gravitational waves, which are caused by colliding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them thought they were crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized them as crazy geniuses, so that the US National Science Foundation financed her idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, design, conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Ligo: the Laser Interferometer-gravitational-waves observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the following period, the precision of the ligo could be significantly increased, which greatly improved the recognition performance.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is called Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015, Ligo was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor, persistent problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On 14 September 2015, only a few days after the commissioning of the detector, the gravitational-waves roamed through the earth through the two colliding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="486">They walked through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the goodbye to my death-sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">In essence, these were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been examining gravitational waves of black holes and their transmitters like ligo. what are gravitational-waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational-wave is a mutilation in the structure of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When crossing the shaft, the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and put into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">Lecturers in courses on the theory of relativity often lead to a truly alpine dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dusting, stretching and dusting."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On September 14th, for example, each of us was stretched and smoked by us when the waves were hit. the elongation of an average man was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">That is, 20 zeros after the comma followed by a 1. that's why the Ligo staff was insane.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five-kilometre laser detector, and that is already absurd, this length should be measured in less than a thousandth of the radius of a nucleus. that's grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text about gravity</seg>
<seg id="502">"" "described Kip Thorne, a co-founder of Ligos, the hunt for the waves as follows:" "" "the technical difficulties in constructing these detectors are enormous." ""</seg>
<seg id="503">"" "but physicists are inventive and with the support of the public all obstacles will certainly be overcome." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott likes to say that Ligo is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I would like to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength that is much smaller than things around us: facial features, the size of your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practical, because you can create a picture or a map of things by perceiving the light around you from several points.</seg>
<seg id="509">In sounds this is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">That is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you:</seg>
<seg id="512">About the face of your child.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and height, rhythm and volume to close the story behind it.</seg>
<seg id="514">"" "" "" "now Alice is talking." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts them."</seg>
<seg id="516">"" "" "" "stupid Bob" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot make simple pictures of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by paying attention to changes in amplitude and frequency of waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo, the measured frequencies lie within the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">So if we convert wave patterns into sound, we can literally hear the universe.</seg>
<seg id="522">To listen to the gravity can tell us a lot about the collision of two black holes, which my colleague Scott has occupied for quite a long time.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-rotating holes, simply chirp: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Turn the two bodies very quickly, you hear the same chirp with an additional key change. that sounds so on: wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement vocabulary, imprinted in the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date at least I'll never forget -- doesn't Ligo hear the following: [Surrender's sound] somebody who knows what he has to listen to recognizes this as a sound of -- SH:... two black holes with each 30 times solar mass, which rotate around as fast as the rods of your mixer.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's consider what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the densest body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, circle a hundred times per second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know about it because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">This is the permanent significance of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo is paving an entirely new way to explore the universe as it was never possible before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this path we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in space we can -- practically or basically -- do not see.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why masserolean stars explode in super-novas.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we have learned a lot about them all.</seg>
<seg id="538">But the exciting physical processes happen at the core, hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see through because these are opaque.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass. the Big Bang: I would like to explore the first minutes of the cosmos, but we will never see them since the Big Bang is covered by its own tail lights.</seg>
<seg id="541">With the help of gravitational-waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And the most important thing: I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen, which we will never see and of which we have no idea. things that we only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, in the first run, Ligo found things that we did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says on this subject: me: the type of stars that black holes produce how ligo they watch are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient bodies of prehistoric times. the black holes are so to speak the Saurierknochen for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">Ligo allows us a completely different view of the events in space, the emergence of the stars, and ultimately how we proceeded out of this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now is to be as bold as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to Ligo we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and circus of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big Bang itself?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago, I experimented with an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "for one year I would say" "" "yes!" "" "I was afraid of." ""</seg>
<seg id="556">No matter if it made me nervous, upset me in unpleasant situations, I forced myself to say "yes."</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Wanted to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Do I want to start playing with the show?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, yes, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: exactly what I was afraid of, I removed my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear of talking, my social fear -- puff, away.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"" "" "" "yes" "" "changed my life." ""</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain yes that changed my life deeply to an unexpectedly kind. it began with a question of my little ones.</seg>
<seg id="569">"" "I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the youngest, calls for all" "" "kitten" "" "for inexplicable reasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she were a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"" "" "" "pussy, I need milk for my bill of beak" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="572">She once asked me if I could play with her when I was just on the go. and I said, "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">This yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new attitude towards life in my family. from then on I bothered to always play with them as soon as you ask me. no matter what I'm doing, or where I go, I always say yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect, but I'm very tired.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, my children, on our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has an amazing side effect: only recently I fully understood that the "yes" say to play with my children saved my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am a writer. I think things out, catch up with life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Job job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Job job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create TV. I produce television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I'm doing TV, in great style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each broadcast offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode each nine days four shows, so every nine days 20 million dollars TV, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three programmes that are simultaneously in production, once four, 16 episodes: scandal, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours TV,</seg>
<seg id="592">$350 million for one season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my TV series run one after the other on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world, my series in 256 regions run in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV-hours are consignments that I created myself, and not just produced, so still overhead. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans around the campfire and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four TV series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfires burning around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who does that still?</seg>
<seg id="598">No one, that's why I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Job job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it because I know what you think when the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you so that all of you who work so hard, whether you run a company, a country or a classroom, take me seriously when I talk about work to help you understand that I'm not just cruising on the computer and fanciful, and it's true when I say: I understand that it doesn't dream about dream job.</seg>
<seg id="603">It's all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work a lot, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I'm deepened in my work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work is creating a country out of nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="607">It's like I set up troops as I painted on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">This is the case with a high sound, delivering a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all this at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love working.</seg>
<seg id="612">She is creative, mechanical, tiring and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and reasonable. and the best part is the sum.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work is going well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A buzzing begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the humming sounds like a busy road, I could go for it forever.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people accept when I declare to them the buzzing that I am talking about writing that writing gives me joy.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't you understand me wrong, you do it.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the totals -- when I started to work and work and work, build, create and work together, I discovered this thing, this buzzing, this energy. the buzz!</seg>
<seg id="618">The sum is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The buzzing is action and activity. the buzzing is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The humming is music. the humming is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The humming is the voice of God in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a sum, then you cannot aspire differently than by size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling of not being able to strive for size, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the totem.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means being a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is called a genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I just know that I'm not made for failure, and I just know that I love the humming.</seg>
<seg id="631">I just want to tell you, I'm a Titan, and I know I don't want to question it.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make it clear: the more successful I become, the more episodes, the more episodes, the more work there are, the more things are, the more things I write, the more I write history, the more expectations there are.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The land I created, the marathon, which I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound, the buzzing, the sum, the totals.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this humming. I love the humming.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sum. I am the sum.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this humming?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the buzzing stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Reworked, overloaded, exaggerated, burned out.</seg>
<seg id="642">The buzzing stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are used to the truth that their mommy is a single work type.</seg>
<seg id="644">"" "Harper tells people:" "" "my mum will not be there, but you can write to my Nanny." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="645">And Emerson says: "kitten, I want to go to Shonda country."</seg>
<seg id="646">It is the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are baby titan.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the buzzing ceased.</seg>
<seg id="649">The humming of the engine stopped.</seg>
<seg id="650">I did not love my work any more. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The buzzing did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My humming was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I made the same things as always: the same Titans work, 15 hours-day, working weekends, no remorse, nothing delegating, a Titan sleeping doesn't give up, with all my heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no humming.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a showcase-Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was grey, I just had no fun anymore.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the buzzing and the buzzing I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do when what you do, the work you love suddenly fades?</seg>
<seg id="665">"" "I know some may think:" "" "hay, stupid author Titan." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know you do it, you are working, you love what you are doing, being a teacher, a banker, being a mother, a painter, Bill Gates, you just love another and you know how the humming feels when the buzz is stopped, who is you then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">If the song of my heart stops, can I survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "Southern States waitress" asked me a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "I'm on the way outside, late on and she says," "" "Mum, do you like to play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I already want to say no when two things become aware of me:</seg>
<seg id="674">First, I must say yes to all and secondly, she didn't call me "kitten."</seg>
<seg id="675">"" "she does not call anyone more" "" "chatting" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="676">When did that happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">I miss it when I'm Titan and my buzz betting, and here everything changes in front of my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">"" "and so she says," "" "Mum, do you like to play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">"" "and I say," "" "Yes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about this.</seg>
<seg id="681">"" "we play and their sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read very dramatically from the book" "" "Everybody Poops" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it's outstanding because my pain and panic, loneliness and lack of frame, I can do nothing but to watch out.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">The land I create, the marathon, which I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound - they no longer exist.</seg>
<seg id="687">Everything that exists are sticky finger and humid kisses, delicate voices, wax crayons and the song in which it is about letting go, or whatever the girl gets in "The Ice Queen."</seg>
<seg id="688">Peace and simplicity are everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air at this place is so close that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I'm happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door opens and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that doesn't happen immediately, but it happens it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The buzzing comes back slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, barely there, it's quiet, barely audible, but it's there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the buzzing, but a buzzing.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel as if I know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The buzzing, the working environment, the titanium dioxide, this is just the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, if I describe myself using consignments and television hours and how functioning my brain is, then I forgot what the real sum is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The buzzing is not a force and it is not labour-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real humming depends on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The buzzing is the current coming from the lust of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">Real humming is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">Real humming ignores the pressure of history, the tasks imposed, the expectation and the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real buzzing is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real humming is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered to me the false words, because what God told me that I am a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It's just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a bit more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I do this as a rule, so that I can free myself from all guilt as a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is a law, I have no other choice. I have no other choice unless I want to hear the sum.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">Playing is not up to me as I work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth hurts,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like playing it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work, because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer working at home than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This admission is painful, because what a person is better to be than home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, yes, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">Honestly, I call myself "Titan" --</seg>
<seg id="729">I must have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am very relaxed is none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">We rush around in the garden, forward and forth, back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">I feel mostly stiff, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always use my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live, and the humming of the universe fills me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why have we ever stopped playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also do it! always say yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Perhaps you hold me naive, for a day dreaming.</seg>
<seg id="742">You're right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">They have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a Muppet show character.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes, until they think they want to do something different.</seg>
<seg id="748">It's wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a ladybug or cookie replaces me.</seg>
<seg id="750">And talking my teenage daughter for 15 minutes with me, I am mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">It is only 15 minutes, there is no need.</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can take 15 minutes a day, even on a bad-day-day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes a piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile phone, no washing, no distraction.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children are ready to bed.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are inside!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my well-being, my world. it doesn't have to be the children. it is important to feel the humming of having a place for peace.</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with your own children. it's about pleasure,</seg>
<seg id="759">"" "to" "" "play" "" "in general." ""</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself to 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you are doing well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find it out and keep it.</seg>
<seg id="763">I'm not perfect in it. I'm leaving and I'm winning. friends meet, read books, enjoy the day --</seg>
<seg id="764">"" "" "" "do you want to play?" "" "is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in training when I wanted to outdo myself more and more." ""</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes a piece, why not allow for full 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The buzzing came back in my spare time. the buzzing seems to return if I don't work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working is not working without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office again. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the sum, but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I'm not the buzz, the buzz is not me... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap bubbles and sticky finger, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">This is my sum.</seg>
<seg id="775">The humming of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The humming of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The sum of work is part of me, but just a part. and I am so thankful for that.</seg>
<seg id="778">It is snap to me that I'm a Titan. I've never seen a Titan who plays a trip to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said yes to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And still I have everything under control. my brain is still working. my bonfires are still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">The more I play, the happier I and my children.</seg>
<seg id="782">The more I play, the more I feel as a good mother.</seg>
<seg id="783">The more I play, the clearer my head.</seg>
<seg id="784">The more I play, the better I work.</seg>
<seg id="785">The more I play, the more I hear the sum. the land I created, the marathon, which I run, the troops, the canvases, the high sound, the buzzing, the other, the right sum: the buzzing of life.</seg>
<seg id="786">The more I feel this sum, the more this unusual, lasting, bare and new attitude of life in me is wide. less Titan -- more I!</seg>
<seg id="787">The more I feel this sum, the more I know who I am.</seg>
<seg id="788">I am a writer. I think things out, I'm going to catch you to life.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is part of the job, which means living his dream.</seg>
<seg id="790">This is the dream of this job,</seg>
<seg id="791">For a dream job should be a little dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">"" "I said" "" "Yes" "" "to less work and more games." ""</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am a neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues, I have every day to do with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to another after a serious stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgeons it is very frustrating that the brain, in contrast to other body organs, has a very low capacity for self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a severe injury of the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, severe disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I was functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional Neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nervous functions by different surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">They have certainly heard of one of the most well-known, the "brain stimulation." in doing so, one implanted a electrode deeply in the brain to influence the neurons' circuitry so that the neurological function is improved.</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients suffering from Parkinson's disease, suffering from severe tremors and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation however does not mean neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion, we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to it.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help, the brain can help yourself.</seg>
<seg id="811">History began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">I often provided patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They must imagine that the brain is swollen and the head pressure increases with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="815">In order to save life, one has to reduce the pressure of the skull.</seg>
<seg id="816">Sometimes you have to remove a part of swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to use Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist to analyze the brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">Allowing cells to grow from one piece of fabric is comparable to very small children, which are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You need to find proper nutrition, temperature, humidity and the environments to thrive them.</seg>
<seg id="823">That's exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts Jean-François was able to do it.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw this under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why? why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked exactly as a stem cell culture. with large green cells surrounded by small, unripe cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you know from biology lessons that stem cells are unripe cells that can turn into each cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to get this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They parted slowly and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, strange cell population that looked like stem cells but behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed a long time to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They comprise 4% of our brain cattle cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">At the stage of the fetus they care for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why are they going to get us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know this.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they are taking part in the healing of the brain as we find them close to brain injuries in higher concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so certain.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing is clear, however -- of these cells we got our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We stand in front of a potential cell source that allows brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove this.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean-François did.</seg>
<seg id="853">And then mark them in color to be able to trace them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step, we re-elected them at the acceptance test of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplant.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we reimplantate these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we reimplantate the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouger we were able to work with apes.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario, we reimplained the cells in a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely, as if they were removed again, they go back home. the space is already occupied, they are not needed there, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we put an injury to and reimplantants exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew up to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you can see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been re-planted.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence they show are these little points. these are the cells that we dye in vitro, in culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Of course we could not stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained apes with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made it very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they reached a stable level of skill, we injured the motor-motor range in the motor Cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">Thereupon the monkeys were paralyzed, they couldn't move their hand any more.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen in people, they spontaneously recovered to a certain degree, just like after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">Patients are paralyzed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. they recover to a certain degree, just like the monkey.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were sure that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left side you see the monkey, who recovered spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance from prior to injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now see, when we reimplantated the cells: the same monkey, two months after the reimplantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that was also very exciting for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze it and use it later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implant them in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can show you soon how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that just now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think: "I know someone who can do that."</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials on humans.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. proceeding from these great results, one has to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through this type of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it will take until someone can come to hospital and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authority allow us to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to choose the patient to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">Then you have to apply this to a multi-centric study.</seg>
<seg id="897">First you need to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you have told us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider them as self-evident.</seg>
<seg id="903">We do not see democracy as the fragile plant it is in reality, but as an inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as immutable tidiness.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great imitators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a thriving capitalism and an impressive growth, while politics is completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">In fact, democracy is dwindling with us, in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- I was unequivocally made clear to me as finance minister in the Eurogroup that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- could not influence the austerity programs realized in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At that moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew, or the Communist Party of China, or some of my friends, who repeatedly told me that democracy would be abolished if it would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I ask you, together with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup will have a wrong belief, we could save democracy, but that we need a true and defensive democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">Because without democracy our societies are masked, our future bleak up and our great new technologies are wasted.</seg>
<seg id="914">I would like to remind you of an interesting contradiction which currently threatens our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">"" "I call it the" "" "twin summit paradox." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="916">A peak is known to you. you know and recognize him as the mountain of debt, which throws its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the debt mountain,</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognise his twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash, which belongs to the wealthy economists and corporations, which, however, are too anxious to invest in where it would be productive and income, with which one could take away the debt mountain and also produce all the things that humanity needs, for example "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past three months, 3,4 trillion US dollars were invested in the United States, England and the eurozone, in all the wealth producing goods, such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment and so on and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 trillion US dollars sounds like a lot of money until it compares to the $1 trillion of US dollars, which at the same time lagged in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing was done except stock exchanges and rise in real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus debt and unproductive capital are the twin peaks that are not compensated by the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result are stagnant wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the US, Japan and Europe unemployed, and consequently a low macroeconomic demand that advocates the pessimism of investors, which, like in a continuous loop, advocates the pessimism of investors, which, in fear, the prophecy of the miracle may be true that his son would kill him if he grew up,</seg>
<seg id="925">Unintentionally causes the circumstances to cause that Oedipus kills him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my shark with capitalism!</seg>
<seg id="927">All the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, develop human talents and especially finance all the technologies, "green" technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">So is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we continue, what do we understand under democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy closed too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, it would be a mistake to reduce the significance of the Athenian democracy on account of these exclusions.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decisive factor in the Athenian democracy was and is that it withdrew the working poor, and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but more importantly and decisively that they gave them the right to political co-determination with the same ballot of votes in matters of state issues.</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy hasn't lasted for a long time --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle that shines brightly, it is burned out quickly.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our present liberal democracies have not their roots in ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious Revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the Athenian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which was ultimately a statute for rulers.</seg>
<seg id="940">For liberal democracy first appeared when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics while the economy -- that is, the world of corporations -- became a democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In today's democracies, since the time when this separation of politics and economy began, there has been a relentless struggle between the two, by gradually migrating politics and emasculating it.</seg>
<seg id="942">Are you wondering why politicians are no longer as they used to be?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not due to a degeneration of its DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is because today it is possible to be in the government and still not in power because the power is migrated from politics into the economy and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my sharks with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">When you think about it, it's like a herd of carnivores that sustainably undermines the animals they feed on, that they end up starving at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">Similarly, it is with the economy that has harmed policy so far that it hurts itself through the self-created economic crisis itself. the power of corporations is growing, political goods are depreciated, political goods rise, the macroeconomic demand falls, and the directors of the corporations are too frightened to invest the cash of their businesses.</seg>
<seg id="948">The more successful capitalism drives the "demos" out of democracy, the higher the twin peaks become, and the greater the waste of human labour and the prosperity of mankind.</seg>
<seg id="949">If this is true, it is obvious that we have to reunite politics and the economy, and it would be better if the "demos" keeps control, as in ancient Athens, aside from exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">By the way, this is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist Left had this idea 100 years ago and it did not go very well.</seg>
<seg id="952">The doctrine of the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position like in ancient Athens without creating new types of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is one solution: to abolish the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low-wage workers through automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is that so long economy and politics are separate areas, automation makes the twin peaks higher, the waste more sublime, and the social conflicts more deeply, as it is -- already very soon, as I believe -- in countries like China.</seg>
<seg id="956">So we have to reorganize the economy and reunite the areas of business and politics, and take care that we will democratize the reunified field, otherwise we end up in a pathological surveillance hyperautocracy, which makes the film "Matrix" appear as a documentary.</seg>
<seg id="957">So the question is not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that it has produced --</seg>
<seg id="958">The more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to that in "matrix," or by something similar to society in "Star Trek," in which people serve human beings and people put their energy into the exploration of the universe, or into a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians "Agora," in long talks the meaning of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we can be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it be like, how could it look like having this "Star Trek" -like utopia instead of "Matrix" similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation, I would like to give you some examples.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the field of companies: please introduce a capital market in which you earn money while you work and in which your capital will follow you from one office to the next, from one company to the next, and the company -- no matter what you are working at - is property of those currently working in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all revenues from capital and revenues originate and the concept of wage labour is completely overtaken.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction more between those who belong to the enterprises, but who do not work in it, and employees who work there, whom the company does not belong. no deaf more between capital and labour, no big gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no towering twin peaks.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the field of global political economy: please briefly imagine that our national currencies would have a free fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest emerging countries], in the interests of all humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that the whole world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it "the cosmos," in units of "Cosmos" -- and each government pays the sum equivalent to the trade deficit or net income of the respective country into a common fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">"" "imagine that this fund invests in" "" "green" "" "technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare." ""</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference from 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today we have them, in particular against the background of a reunified policy and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world I describe is at the same time liberal in which they favored privileged individuals, and Marxist, because they have buried the separation of capital and labour in the dustbin of history, and Keynesian, global Keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all else, it is a world in which we can imagine real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we awaken in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">"" "or will we sink into a" "" "matrix" "" "- similar dystopia?" ""</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands, and we do it better democratic.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself as Libertarian Marxists in your biography.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if any of what I have just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for the reunification of politics and economics is... Do we not do this, technological development will generate such a massive decline in aggregate demand, which is called Larry Summers as "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">By transferring this crisis from one part of the world to the next, as we are currently experiencing, it will not only destabilise our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is small.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is true, then Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Just like Hayek, that's why I am a liberal Marxist, and like Keynes, and that is why I am completely unhappy.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: indeed, and now we are.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you're not crazy, you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein who said this. BG: in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you have clearly said what you think of the West's view in China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies, we have the appearance of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my speech, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most of it plays out -- the sphere of economy -- is a completely democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In some ways, if I may say so provocative, China is similar to the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- remember -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- that is a mistake, historically considered.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberals, such as John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical about the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What we can observe now in China is similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">China is now pretending to do what the West has done in the 19th century, smells tremendously according to hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experience as Finance Minister of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I thought that's coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later to the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece, but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">"" "" "" "namely to say goodbye to the complacency, and the permanent denial that a massive fault line went through the eurozone, and continues to be massively threatened by the development of the whole European Union." ""</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity, based on Greek proposal -- by the way, the first proposal revealed this denial --</seg>
<seg id="1008">"" "" "" "unfortunately, the powers within the euro area, within the European group, have chosen denial." ""</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what's coming.</seg>
<seg id="1010">That is the experience from the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If you try to keep an economic system that is not viable to live by political will and authoritarianism, it will perhaps be delayed for a while, but if the change occurs it happens abruptly and destructive.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what change do you expect?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future if we do not change its construction.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- seriously...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a finance minister or minister, who is in office after 6 months, especially in such a tense situation, he claims he has made no mistake, then this is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the application for an extension of the debt programme at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest on the lenders' sides to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that didn't exist.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They merely wanted to bring our government down because they did not want to deal with the distortions running through the eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They did not want to admit that they had a disastrous programme in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost one third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">It is worse than during the "Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="1026">"" "no one from the Troika of the financiers imposed on us this policy was:" "" "that was a colossal mistake." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1027">BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive tone of the conversations, you seem to be quite pro-European.</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">My criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe.</seg>
<seg id="1030">My biggest fear is that the eurozone does not survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">For if it does not survive, the released centrifugal forces will be demonic and destroy the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This will not be disastrous for Europe alone, but for the entire global economy.</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">If we allow ourselves to embark on the path of a post-modern 1930, what appears to me, it will also be detrimental to the future of Europeans and non-Europeans.</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope that you are wrong at this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Yanis, thank you for being at TED.</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">By Roy Price most people have never heard before, although he is probably responsible for 22 medium-sized minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">That goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is a senior employee at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">He is 47 years old, slim, has a hairstyle hairstyle and describes himself on Twitter as "movies, TV, technique, tacos."</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and the content that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course, this is a very hard-fought industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy can't select any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He must find shows which are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he must find shows located quite right on this corner.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the evaluation distribution of over 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this review gets.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is rated at nine and above, it is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These are shows like "Breaking Bad," "Game of Thrones," "The Wire," all the shows that are addictive, where after watching a season, your brain asks: "where are there more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left side, here at this end, shows like "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1055">"" "Roy Price does not worry about getting on the left side of the curve because I think you need special intelligence to sign" "" "Toddlers and Tiaras" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes more thoughts about the middle evasion, the average television -- the shows, which are neither good nor bad, they simply don't inspire.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure that he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The print is present, and of course it's the first time Amazon makes something so Roy Price does not want to risk anything.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He requires guaranteed success, so he holds a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes a lot of ideas for TV shows and selects eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online, where they can watch for free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon gives out for nothing, do you access, right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of spectators watch these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">But they don't know they are being watched while watching these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team who record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You collect when you start the show, when you pause, which parts one skips or looks again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">You collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce using these data.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"" "in fact, they collect the data, process them and from them the answer is, and this is:" "" "Amazon should make a Sitcom for four Republican US Senators." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Yes, "Alpha House," but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn't so good.</seg>
<seg id="1072">It's just an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House ends at 7.5 -- so somewhat above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming of Netflix. just like Roy, he is always on the lookout to find it a super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of holding a contest, he and his team have watched the existing data on the Netflix viewer, so the reviews they give the shows, their course, what shows they like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use these data to find out these little details about the audience: what shows they like, which producers, what actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together, they entered a venture and decided not to make a sitcom for four senators but a drama series about a senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9.1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course, the question now is: what's going on here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">One has two very competitive, data sealed companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They combine these many data and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow says that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you collect millions of data, for a decision you meet, then you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">You optimize it by using very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The least thing you can expect is good television, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis does not work, then this is a bit frightening because we live in a time where we have more and more access to statistics to make serious choices, far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">Nobody. OK, that's good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope no one in this room ever comes into contact with this software. come in touch with it, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is in prison here in the US and asks for release, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dismissal is made or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, it is decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate television, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always produces the best results. this is not because a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the most experienced companies are wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that they can predict violations of flu, the bad way -- by analysing data from Google searches.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the journal Nature.</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked fine, year around year, until it didn't work anymore,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And nobody could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"" "it simply didn't work, this was once again a sensation, including the revocation of publication in the" "" "Nature" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data processing companies like Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">In spite of all these errors, data streams down into decisions of life -- at work, legal enforcement, medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very smart people are unthinkable to use many data to make serious choices as the decision for a cancer treatment</seg>
<seg id="1109">Over the years I have realized a few patterns about the difference between successful decisions using data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you have to solve a complex problem, basically do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">First disassemble this problem into its parts so you can analyze the items; as a second, put the items together again to make a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: taking apart and putting together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help dismantle a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to assemble the parts and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool for this and we all possess it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something in which the brain is good, it is necessary to put parts and pieces together again, even if the information is incomplete, in order to get a good decision -- especially when it is the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">That's why I think Netflix was so successful because they used data and mind where they also belong in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience why they would otherwise have not been able to do. but the decision on how to take all these parts together and make a show like "House of Cards" is not in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team made this decision for this show, which meant that they had a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon, on the other hand, did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their decisions, first as they compete for TV ideas, then when they selected "Alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "it was a safe decision because they could always say," "" "This is telling us the dates." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data is helpful for better decisions, but I think things are going wrong when data start controlling our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and to not forget that, this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"" "it is also called" "" "Magic 8 Ball." "" "it's amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or No question, you just have to shake the ball to get an answer." "" "most likely" "" "-- right here at this moment." ""</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will turn it out later with a technical demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far I've made some decisions in my life, where I should have listened to the ball in hindsight.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you know, of course, if you have the data available, you want to replace it with something much more sophisticated, such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">In the end, it's up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data it still pays to make decisions, be an expert in what you do and take risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because in the end it is not the data, but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you very much.</seg>
