Munich 18@@ 56 : four maps that change your view of the city
an Irish institution , where teenagers should meet today .
a chapel of mine where it is now dug for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
farmers cultivate the former cause of farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories .
it is annoying when maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
everybody knows this because the car navigation system showed a green meadow instead of a b@@ ypass road .
the historical maps of the digital Bavaria At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as Bavaria of the state government , are anything but current - yet very informative .
especially when comparing them with current online maps .
then it becomes clear how cities and communities in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Mer@@ cury have changed since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a fli@@ ck@@ ering carpet , which one cannot recognize as such .
maps , so @-@ called position sheets , have been incorporated into the large picture map for cities and municipalities .
these were created according to the Bavarian State surve@@ ying department between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and are the beginning of Bavaria &apos;s first survey .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leader has occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wished to get an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a top@@ ographic survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
even though the French troops mar@@ ched off with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville on February 9 , 18@@ 01 , it was the present @-@ day neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern @-@ map .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elec@@ tor Max IV Joseph continued the project , founded the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - and thus the Bavarian surve@@ ying management . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the composition sheet for Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 and is to be found on the Bay@@ erische Landes@@ bibliothek &apos; website .
the comparison morning / Today is most impressive in the example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
one example of this is under@@ sen@@ d@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 .
Send@@ ling was employed 21 years after the creation of the map , i.e. 18@@ 77 , as a district of Munich .
today , Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling is in the middle of the city .
the houses of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ lings are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser in 18@@ 78 , a leader of the revol@@ t of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where today is the West@@ park , one sees nothing but fields - at first sight : when zo@@ oming in , a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears : hand@@ written numbered fl@@ utes from the so @-@ called &quot; Ur@@ ption , &quot; from which the landed property was derived .
small plots are no longer occupied by farmers , but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; land in the sun . &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , the scene of the October festival since 18@@ 10 , was indeed a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desires .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the area of today &apos;s Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen district , one reads not only the street name at the &quot; Gast@@ eig &quot; or from the hill &quot; Auf der Lü@@ ften &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt . &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße , one once locked people with ins@@ anity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich District Ir@@ ren@@ aissance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Auf der Au@@ er Lü@@ ften &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was created . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden headed the institution - the psychiat@@ rist , who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time , and for example ended up ank@@ ulating the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Irish &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also prohibited the personnel from using force against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen Museum , who worked for an exhibition with the institution .
there was room for 280 patients , later it was expanded to 500 places .
at some point , this capacity did not suff@@ ice any more - the reason for the construction of the &quot; Krei@@ si@@ r@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; in Haar &#91; 1905 &#93; .
the Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er @-@ Klin@@ ik@@ um Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts since 2006 .
young people in the Munich Sal@@ esi@@ ans are now meeting on the site of the former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and turned it into a youth home with educational establishments .
west is the football field of the TS@@ V Munich East , east of residential buildings of the 1980s .
in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; was built in architectural style to the original building of the Ir@@ ren@@ aissance , which was destroyed during the Second World War by bombing ra@@ ids .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Main Square &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 56 , the Kauf@@ inger street was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Second World War brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
in December 1944 , the Al@@ lies bom@@ bed a lot of holes in the city centre .
a great remained until today - at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
the English institute , small business houses and a tomb chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Mari@@ en@@ hof , where these days are prepar@@ atory work and on 5 April 2017 the ground @-@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn circle route takes place .
with the scroll bar you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial view of today - and fill up the hole at Mari@@ en@@ hof .
civil Rights Group Publi@@ shed Travel War@@ ning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the National Association for the Adv@@ ancement of Far@@ mers has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to discrimin@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the state of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which will enter into force by 28 August 2017 , calls on af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans to pay special attention while travelling through the state , as a number of question@@ able , ra@@ cial @-@ based incidents occur in the entire state and be noted here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a recently adopted Mis@@ sour@@ i law that makes it more difficult for people to recover &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; discrimination complaints &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as well as the prosecution authorities of the state who dispro@@ portion@@ ately aim to minorities , said the NA@@ AC@@ P . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have violations of civil rights which happen to people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are stopped because of their skin colour , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the President of Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , K@@ ans@@ as City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States .
the group cited events such as rac@@ ist crime against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from T@@ enn@@ es@@ see .
S@@ anders died at the beginning of the year in question@@ able circumstances , after he had no petrol during the journey through the state and was put into custody by the police of Mis@@ sour@@ i without being accused of a crime .
the Council also points out a recent report from Mis@@ sour@@ i &apos;s Office of General At@@ tor@@ ney , which shows that black mot@@ orists in the state will be 75 percent more common than wh@@ ites .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ma@@ ys . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people need to be ready to see if they have any ch@@ ewing @-@ money or let relatives know they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ sour@@ i reported 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the hate crime report program of the FB@@ I , which classi@@ fies the state in relation to the number of such violations to the 16th place of the country .
the travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it more difficult to acc@@ use a company for housing or employment discrimination .
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona , after the States had passed immigration laws that would obli@@ ge local prosecution authorities to arrest people due to migration violations , which according to the AC@@ L@@ U will contribute to further ra@@ cial benefit .
travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries , but l@@ ately interest groups have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States .
the fence project is elementary
the Fisch@@ bacher Wei@@ den@@ au@@ n project is a successful project and will be continued next year .
the CD@@ U Members of Parliament Peter White and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac have provided an image on the spot .
in the square yard of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family representatives of the Fisch@@ bacher CD@@ U @-@ district met together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties .
Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann initially gave insights into his farm , in which he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and also many young animals and lod@@ ges in five apartments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black Forest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is for him the alternative marketing path for the milk of his cows , so Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only regional areas come to the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ a@@ este .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as he is also chairman of the fisher@@ man &apos;s bach , he called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elementary importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spontaneous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I cannot profit@@ ably generate on such steep faces .
the green area cares for a lot of work , a lot must be worked on with the brus@@ h@@ cutter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight with the conditions and the top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 , he took over the par@@ ental business and cultivated it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer , even if he did not perform bio @-@ operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the municipality has recognized the importance of the electric fence project and is glad about the leader &apos;s support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare the farmers would have to be supported .
it is hoped that the aff@@ or@@ estation of the land could be pulled out for quite a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have are the people who work in agriculture and are thinking about how they continue their operation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers are often critici@@ zed because of the promotion
in 2013 , a total of 25 plots were fenced by eleven participants .
the area of disclosure is 40 hectares , which should not be for@@ ested by at least 20@@ 23 .
half a leader was promoted by the total cost of 71 500 euros , a quarter was driven by the municipality of Fisch@@ bach .
thus the farmers remained 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers of pasture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the big advantage is the lon@@ gevity of the f@@ ences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are doing a really good job , without farmers and farmers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Peter White said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; best food is produced here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land@@ scape District Cour@@ ts ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Wu@@ ert@@ tem@@ berg enables the government to promote soft f@@ ences .
the aim is to maintain the Black Forest .
the prerequisite is the presence of a flow rate designated by the L@@ PR .
in addition , the area to be enclosed must not be slu@@ gg@@ ish@@ able ( slope a@@ version above 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by the re@@ for@@ estation .
at the moment , eight participants with 24 plots , which want to build just under 16 kilometres of fence , are currently running for the Fisch@@ bacher Wei@@ ler@@ aun@@ ching Project in 2018 .
the area of disclosure is 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 1@@ 12@@ ,000 euros .
is nothing holy ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump is collecting the Statue of Liberty
the sur@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans este@@ em them as much as any other - hence the carefully orchest@@ rated overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ olog@@ ues of the Tr@@ ump ré@@ gi@@ me , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated argument with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CN@@ N on the president &apos;s proposals for dr@@ astic restriction of legal migration to the Statue of Liberty .
to stay fair , Miller didn &apos;t handle the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of bo@@ aters and liberty im@@ it@@ ators would have liked him if he had done it .
but it took its significance , and in particular the meaning that it was attributed to , when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to its base .
when Miller A@@ co@@ sta wrote : &quot; I don &apos;t want to go into a complete thing about history here , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illumin@@ ates the world .
the poem you refer to , which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
Miller is obj@@ ectively correct , but as he formul@@ ates it himself , it is not really about history .
it is about contemporary resonance on the stirring words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your we@@ ary , your poor , and your oppressed masses who desire to breathe freely , and the mis@@ erable garbage of your rich coasts . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a time when the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mis@@ erable waste &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was better seen on our screens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller did not commit himself to literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ um@@ ps USA .
this conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation : it is indeed a conflict over the meaning of America .
Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they performed a highly political action .
the sculpture was to show the connections between French and American Republi@@ can@@ ism by portra@@ ying the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a conventional visual representation .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she gives herself a very different name : mother of the Ex@@ il@@ antes .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist coup and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just as Lazarus has changed the significance of the statue , people from the right wing wanted to change it for a long time .
the great writer R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anyone but rather an early neo @-@ conserv@@ atives that bring the American flame into the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty goes ahead .
it is supposed to carry the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the torch should not light the way to the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
quite unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh &apos;s encounter with something .
the significance of the statue is quite a question of the point of view of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative deed of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted , el@@ event@@ h , but hop@@ eful people after long and often horri@@ ble journeys on the de@@ cks of ships .
it is in the tru@@ est sense to see the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
her statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear .
and that is , of course , not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump would ever like to acknowledge .
their torch should not light the way , but ign@@ ite the hatred that is their only source of power .
world Cup 2017 : N@@ eil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the UK
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two Sc@@ ots were part of the UK team
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance director of the United Kingdom &apos;s athle@@ tics , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent of the World Cup &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which ki@@ cked off on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Scotland something special &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it , and we will continue it until we find it out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it &apos;s absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are med@@ als candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew Ber@@ chart - who are competing against Sir M@@ on Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m circuit , while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was chosen by the team captain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is rather modest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; Black says .
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the passion and genuine feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h naturally brought in were great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth Silver medal winner , who will compete in the 400 m hur@@ d@@ les at its fifth world champi@@ onships , says that it is &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British team .
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven that were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
the mid @-@ range runner Mu@@ ir conduc@@ ts five British and two European records last year .
it will take part at the 1,500 m and 5,000 m of runs .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ s@@ man to watch after a great season that included victory with the British team Tri@@ als and Anni@@ versary Games .
Do@@ yle re@@ members her first world champi@@ onships as the only other Scot@@ s@@ man in the Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell team .
the team captain says that they are &quot; extremely proud &quot; of the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots are not only part of the team , but in some cases also with med@@ als and fin@@ als .
&quot; being special about team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so it was a great honour anyway , but knowing that my team@@ mates voted for me and chose me makes it something special for me , &quot; she added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously I &apos;m very proud of all the Sc@@ ots belonging to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only shows how far we have come .
and they are here as established athletes , athletes , who want to climb on platforms .
as for my speech as a captain ?
yes , I think she went well .
I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back in the Olympic stadium .
I get a second chance to go out and compete there and it will just be such a great atmosphere out there . &quot;
block critic@@ isms on Facebook : do not worry about a public office if you cannot tolerate the heating of elec@@ tors
the father of our country knew something bad news .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the newspapers struck him for everything , from domestic politics to his political principles .
he kno@@ cked on the cri@@ tique , for sure .
but he did not silence his critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because in 17@@ 83 Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , sil@@ ly and mu@@ te we are led like sheep to slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this brings me to Mary@@ land to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry H@@ og@@ an who has to work on being more like Washington .
Ho@@ gans employees have blocked and deleted contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union therefore su@@ ed him at the beginning of this week .
the governor &apos;s staff dismissed the suit as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online comment was full of a reaction with &quot; Na , &quot; and ? . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; many people said .
but it is important .
and it is especially important if it is a type like H@@ og@@ an .
this is a Republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amaz@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest consent of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a reactionary He@@ at of He@@ at .
he has shown a firm hand in guiding his state and rigor@@ ous adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very skill@@ ful to use Facebook as primary means to connect with his voters and to play his hair@@ less head after chemotherapy on his side .
that is why the blocking of people coming to the Gover@@ nor &apos;s side - which is a public forum that is called official , is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous by employees who are paid with public tax dollars .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gans spokes@@ woman Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse advoc@@ ated the governor &apos;s actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it is too simple to use the image of tro@@ lls or sp@@ amm@@ ers or h@@ asser@@ tive people who swing online the whi@@ p .
the mail talked to some of the real people who were blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
and these are just real people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a priest , no tro@@ lls .
they all said their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful and not prof@@ ane .
the priest rec@@ ited the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to the Catholic faith .
attorney Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not hat@@ eful but she asked Hass@@ an Cancel .
&quot; I was pol@@ ite that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crime and other current news , &quot; she wrote in the comment section of the news broadcast &quot; The Post . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I also don &apos;t appreciate this idea if a number of people take a position on the same subject , then some of them are rather dis@@ regarded as a so @-@ called collective employment and are not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what the governor &apos;s employees referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated spam &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would probably call others &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interc@@ ession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or del@@ eting a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in earlier times when one had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical cor@@ p@@ ses or to arrest demonstr@@ ators and silence them .
but this is exactly what is going on digitally .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public official to critic@@ ise Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is su@@ ed by Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones on this issue was in Virginia last week .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of Lou@@ dou@@ n County passed the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to U.S. District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexand@@ ria , when she ban@@ ished a vot@@ er from her Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit from the AC@@ L@@ U because of its use of Facebook and Twitter .
this should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington , the time of affordable cars had a similar effect on the Internet .
the number of papers multiplied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letters fell on his lead .
and even then Washington had anonymous Tro@@ lls .
the people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms as &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius , &quot; wrote letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions .
peti@@ tions , who critic@@ ised his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with Britain , overwhel@@ med his ministry , according to historical documents collected by the online Pap@@ ers of George Washington Project .
but he has not sil@@ enced her .
freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses are the basis of our nation .
and true guidance means accepting that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for home comfort at the Renaissance Club
former European # 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for home comfort over the next three days , as the Renaissance Club in East Lo@@ thi@@ an hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who ran past year next year at Arch@@ er@@ field Links to the final round , was linked to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador on behalf of the club founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ vad@@ i .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he achieved fame with this event , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the players will see this course from its best side , it &apos;s in a great state .
Jer@@ ry did a great job when he set up this place .
he is a keen advoc@@ ate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a great showcase for this course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Engli@@ sh@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , although he has won the European Tour as well as the European Challenge Tour in his 32 @-@ year career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this really feels special , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the player , home to South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dura Open since it was taken out of the program in the year after I won it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it &apos;s a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories from last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win here last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a really special time and one we will always appreciate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50@@ th birthday this year , returns to the action on home ground .
this event will be his first Scottish show since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this extra pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m happy about the time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

less lung cancer through passive smoking
in the past two decades fewer and fewer people have died due to passive smoking in lung cancer .
scientists from the University Medical Center Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) come to this conclusion in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 167 lung cancer deaths can be attributed to passive smoking a year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Director Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison , he drew up his own study on this subject from 1994 .
at that time there were 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking a year in Germany .
the new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health .
house connections prove to be very complex
the construction works in Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and &quot; are reasonably at the time , &quot; said the conductor of the Fred Hein@@ ze site .
in the area of the house connections , the situation is more complicated than assumed , as there is a lot of se@@ amounts in the underground , which is not realised in the plans .
traffic , which is constantly obstruc@@ ting the construction work , is a major problem for the construction of the company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ignorance of mot@@ orists from red traffic lights and barriers is enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road is closed and only the regular buses are entitled to drive through .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Kost@@ or@@ z and Tim Kost@@ or@@ z from St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were quite exhau@@ sting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but fortunately we were supplied with cool mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mar@@ vin Kost@@ or@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
poverty and death in the Indonesian Gold@@ land
when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i cook dinner she doesn &apos;t use a stove .
it even rarely uses a pot .
in its wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai regi@@ ment in the rest@@ less Indonesian province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife normally places a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace .
after half an hour , the char@@ coal tu@@ ber is taken out with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands and swal@@ lowed .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the earth floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs daily work , for example to wash clothes with mur@@ ky water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bucket in a hom@@ eless room serves as a lat@@ rine .
as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , no fields were assigned .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course , late to work can be dangerous : most of the vill@@ agers are unemployed , and many drink heavily , and there are the soldiers .
&quot; nobody dar@@ es to walk around in the village after 17 o &apos;clock , &quot; she says .
it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders were to vote in front of the occup@@ ying forces .
an existing movement , which stir@@ red up independence against the Dutch rule , quickly turned against the Jak@@ arta government , which maintains control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal ob@@ servers .
in 2003 , the province was officially divided into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua . the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea included the eastern part of the island .
the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour car driving with the car .
there is no public transport .
the city with approximately 19@@ ,000 inhabitants is made up of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo f@@ ences , and from corrugated iron roofs , which were transformed by rust in various yellow @-@ brown tones .
only very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their journey here , let alone journalists and virtually no foreigners .
before the Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ ua worshipped a god named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not used to wearing these clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i , indicating their lively , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , their dark shirt and their bright coat . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; earlier we had only leaves on our bodies . &quot;
Pap@@ ua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province , where 28 % of people live under the poverty line and have some of the worst inf@@ ant mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s Gold@@ land .
the largest and most profitable gold mine of the world , Gr@@ ass Mountain , owned by the Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an of Phoenix , lies only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Free@@ port has broken down $ 3.1 billion in gold and copper .
Pap@@ ua also has wood resources valued at $ 78 billion .
these riches , however , are a source of misery for the Pap@@ ua which ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military guard a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence .
an analysis of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port paid local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004 almost $ 20 million , including up to 15@@ 0,000 US dollars in one single officer .
Pap@@ u@@ vian demands for greater autonomy thre@@ aten this golden go@@ ose and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
according to activists , more than 500@@ ,000 Pap@@ ua were killed and thousands have been ra@@ ped , tor@@ tured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969 .
mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ ua &apos;s tribal lands in the 1970 &quot; s were genocide according to the Asia Convention on Human Rights .
in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we Are E@@ ating Every@@ thing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means in a report of the Arch@@ dioc@@ ese of Bris@@ ban@@ e from 2016 , which reports on atro@@ cities of the previous year , such as illegal execution and torture - rape and electric charges are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims , as incidents happen every week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the screws have increased as Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s resources produce an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic developments are changing , as Muslim migrant workers come from the popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ den ch@@ ur@@ ch@@ ins sell fried chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables served with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce .
local people fight to keep up here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the migrants have started selling h@@ ens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Pap@@ ua , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai Local , who went to work in the province capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cost the native Pap@@ ua - Mama @-@ M@@ um &#91; the women &#93; of Pap@@ ua . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Indonesian President J@@ oko Wi@@ do@@ do , known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised to address ine@@ qualities and legal violations in Pap@@ ua during his campaign in 2014 .
the former Zimmermann secured 27 of the 29 bor@@ ou@@ ghs of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Pap@@ ua , little has changed , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts are broken because we voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i in 2014 , with the expectation that it will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says You . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai dealt a low point just two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is &apos;s inauguration in October .
on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children was outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle .
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should turn on their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers had offen@@ ded their tone and later returned with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ edt T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers , who had d@@ rank , pursued and smote the group with their ri@@ f@@ le @-@ servants , and said , Sac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ces and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
one child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ on@@ o , was so badly beaten that he fell into coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set fire and things escal@@ ated the next day .
about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered at a soccer field in front of the local police station and the Military Command Centre to demand justice .
they wore cerem@@ onial hunt @-@ bows and led the Wa@@ ita @-@ Dance - in the circle continuously and a bird song im@@ it@@ ating - from Pap@@ ua &apos;s Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators began to spin stones on police and military posts .
when the mood was heated , a command was sent to the soldiers by an internal radio : &quot; if the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; said it in an official document of TI@@ ME , which was not released to the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the im@@ pending danger and called for rest and called for the crowd to return home .
no one was in the mood to listen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot into my left wrist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the veranda of his colourful wooden house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kay@@ ame still doesn &apos;t know who fired , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here .
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds .
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his cous@@ in , who witnessed the shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and examined his body to be sure he was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who just bears a name like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans , the TI@@ ME in a dark mood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him . &quot;
the chief inspec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je M@@ ende , told repor@@ ters that his officers wanted to &quot; secure &quot; their station because they were attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves if people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Su@@ li@@ sti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many more injured .
the news of the kill@@ ings came only on the following day &apos; filtered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
for three weeks , Jok@@ ow@@ i held a passionate speech in Jay@@ ap@@ ura , in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historical gri@@ ev@@ ances in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be solved immediately , so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Minister of Security Wi@@ ran@@ to said in October 2016 that he set out a non @-@ judicial mechanism for the settlement of historical human rights violations .
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most injuries have occurred a long time ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to tackl@@ ing these violations , but there are processes that need to go through &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then Wi@@ ran@@ to made a withdrawal when he spoke at Jak@@ arta with TI@@ ME on 5 June and said he had no plans to establish a complaint mechanism in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything is regulated by law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wi@@ ran@@ to , accused by the UN for &quot; crimes against humanity , &quot; calling for more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody liberation vote in 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights violations had already been settled in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai affair .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims accepted such claims with fierce de@@ fi@@ ance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m afraid to be arrested by the military , I &apos;m afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us reiter@@ ated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I had buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military sought me , &quot; he says .
the sho@@ ot@@ ings did not cease .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police shot at the vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood Dei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confrontation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a building company refused to bring a unconscious man to the hospital , a person and 17 others died , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ra@@ viol@@ anus , Dou@@ w , drow@@ ned when he f@@ ished in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .
excited vill@@ agers prot@@ ested in the company &apos;s sit@@ ing office .
the police said that the vill@@ agers threw stones on officers who responded by firing the warning shots .
but locals say that the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade ( Indonesian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began shooting at the crowd and killed one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly handed down here , so the TI@@ ME . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called upon the officers to take account of the officers involved and withdraw the police &apos;s mobile police bri@@ g@@ ade .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a flash@@ light for the Indonesian government .
the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ content of the family members Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al who live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua .
many joined the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army , claiming to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua by spur@@ ring spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings by Indonesian soldiers .
some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ o@@ ya .
in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were arrested and arbitr@@ arily arrested in custody , under the pre@@ text of &quot; securing national sovereignty . &quot;
some never appear again .
among the people in Pap@@ ua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty strengthens dis@@ content .
the little rice sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as out of reach .
people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can work four or five fields of sweet potatoes .
they keep most of the crops for the family , while the rest is sold in the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indonesian Rup@@ iah ( 75 c@@ ents ) .
in the course of time , economic ine@@ qualities between the native Pap@@ ua and the new migrants have grown , which since the opening of new routes to the Nab@@ ire airport have arrived in greater numbers .
the few jobs that exist in the region are usually addressed to the better educated and aff@@ lu@@ ent migrants .
Pap@@ ua rarely have capital or the necessary skills to make their own companies competitive .
&quot; young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Go@@ bai , Chairman of the tribal Council of Pan@@ i@@ ai .
isolation holds the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
in addition , restrictions on reporting international media remain ten@@ se .
at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ die and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported for lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although they gave them rare permission to film .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , Human Rights Watch , Vice @-@ President of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is &apos;s campaign to lift the restrictions of reporting to promote transparency and development were not realized .
&quot; there are new dangers to foreign journalists attempting to report from Indonesia &apos;s un@@ peaceful eastern provinces of Pap@@ ua and Western pap@@ ua : visa refusal and black@@ list , &quot; he said in a statement .
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely confined to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ ua .
in March , six paci@@ fic states - Ton@@ ga , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - asked the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; different and widespread violations &quot; in Pap@@ ua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting .
the same countries have historically supported the O@@ PM .
the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ar@@ r@@ man@@ tha N@@ asi@@ r rejected the accus@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system , and there are free media , so it is difficult to cover the evidence for human rights cases . &quot;
the local people want more foreign governments to take note of this .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , headed by K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura , visited Jay@@ ap@@ ura on 4 May , locals broke their silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also participated in the meeting , but would like to remain anonymous .
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Pap@@ ua would probably not vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i again .
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; said Go@@ bai , Chairman of the tribal Council .
he wants the Pan@@ i@@ ai people to know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from the fact that it lives under the constant threat of a pre@@ dat@@ ory military , is in poor educational and health services .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Mum@@ bai , the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , consider their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guilt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has to pay back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says .
despite the threats and intim@@ id@@ ations , the families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai fire victims led to the last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the body of a victim was buried on a site exactly opposite the police and the military station .
they know they will never give them justice , but at least they do not let those responsible forget their crimes .
&quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with a lowered head .
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
on Friday , a fire took place in one of the world &apos;s highest residential towers in Dubai , forcing hundreds of residents to flee from the 3@@ 37 @-@ metre @-@ high , 79 @-@ storey building .
it is the second fire , which in only two years swe@@ eps through the sky@@ scra@@ per , which is accidentally called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) .
the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up at the fire alarm and the shou@@ ting of the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50@@ th floor , &quot; said a resident who attacked his name as George An@@ ab , Reu@@ ters .
Du@@ ba@@ is &apos;s civil defence authorities said that fire fighting units destroyed the fire at 4.@@ 00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .@@ 00 GMT ) and cooled the building .
the government said it was working on providing accommodation for those concerned .
the incident can re@@ vit@@ alize questions on the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of sky@@ scra@@ pers around the world .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage came from fair@@ ing , exterior cl@@ adding for decoration or insulation .
in Britain the police said they believe that the system of panels for insulation and cl@@ adding could have contributed to the rapid spread of a Bran@@ des in June where about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup reform : more Best @-@ of @-@ five
the president of the International Tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) has fallen through his large Davis Cup cou@@ p at the Annual General Meeting .
at the Ho Chi Min@@ h City meeting , the revolutionary suggestion for this sport to play Davis Cup single was not supported by the required two @-@ thirds majority .
these often very long , but also very cher@@ ished five @-@ pack classics remain thus preserved to the traditional competition .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 % of member countries voted for reform , the goal of IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore narrow@@ ly missed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our member nations have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change in order to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical cont@@ ests , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will continue to work on improving the application .
not until the vote , after many contradictions , had already made the proposal to take the fin@@ als on a neutral place .
new from 2018 onwards , only comparatively minor details will be added : in the following year , the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will have the right to host in the first round .
in order to reduce the costs for the organizers , the requirements regarding training places etc. are facilit@@ ated and players will have to do less official media appointments before the Davis Cup .
more than 1 out of 5 US travelers bring prohibited items to the aircraft , find a survey
a flight pas@@ sage@@ way survey revealed that more than 20 percent of intentionally or un@@ consciously prohibited items were s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ed by the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , among them at least 6 percent who entered the aircraft while they accidentally carried out knives or other items with blades .
less than 1 per cent said they had bel@@ ated discovered that they had gone wrong with fire@@ arms , amm@@ uni@@ tion or explo@@ sives .
the survey conducted for more than 1,000 people , carried out by a jet charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also noted that younger travellers are more likely to ignore the rules .
of the respon@@ dents who admitted that they know@@ ingly tried to fly with something prohibited by the T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 percent of mill@@ enni@@ als , compared to less than 15 percent , were members of Generation X .
the most common items that have been deliberately passed by T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
more than 3 per cent said , know@@ ingly having carried items with blades by security control , while 2.2 percent of the female respon@@ dents and 3.@@ 7 percent of the male respon@@ dents also confirmed that they had deliberately forbidden drugs in the plane .
the company said it asked travelers throughout the country to find out how many accidentally s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ed goods had been brought about by airport security and how many people had intentionally done it .
it is no surprise that people who are most likely s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - wear safety , those who fly most often .
however , the company insi@@ sts that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often uncertain about which fluids they may take or how much of it .
it is therefore no surprise that the largest amount of liquids conf@@ is@@ cated by the T@@ SA are forbidden liquids .
for a while people thought T@@ SA could look at books as s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers .
liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel order
&quot; &quot; &quot; electric @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k likes to deal with the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Model 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so far , he has under@@ estimated that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non @-@ binding reservation .
in addition to the always tri@@ ump@@ y figures for sales increases and still more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la &apos;s boss El@@ on Mus@@ k has revealed another , less brilliant figure at the announcement of the latest quar@@ terly assessment : that of the cancell@@ ations at the new mass market model 3 .
over the past few months , Mus@@ k has often had more than 500@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose delivery begins .
now Mus@@ k ad@@ mits : 6@@ 3.000 times have been withdrawn from the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders .
critics have always pointed out that it is merely a non @-@ binding reservations .
in the event of a cancellation , Tes@@ la will pay the 1000 Euro ( in the USA 1000 US dollars and in the UK £ 1000 ) &quot; Reservation Pay@@ ments . &quot;
currently 45@@ ,000 such non @-@ binding reservations are being presented , Mus@@ k admitted in a telephone conference with analysts .
the Tes@@ la boss does not believe that the cancellation of up to twelve percent of all orders could become a problem .
his argument : the challenge with ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production side .
last year , Tes@@ la delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all models will be together in 2018 - 500@@ ,000 by 2020 , a million . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k , 1800 online reservations are made .

EPA Supreme P@@ ru@@ itt re@@ treats due to the hes@@ itation of the rules of the Obama Er@@ a to reduce emissions
a day after being su@@ ed by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , head of the Environment Agency , took back his earlier decision to delay implementing the rules of the Obama era in order to reduce the emissions of smo@@ g @-@ causing air pollutants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change as his agency turned out to be more responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the complaint filed against his previous post in a Federal Court of Appe@@ al .
it is a deadline that expi@@ red on 1 October for States to comply with the 2015 standards for o@@ zone @-@ related o@@ zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he will delay the observ@@ ance for one year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interfere in local decisions or h@@ amp@@ er economic growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump was prosec@@ utor of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , was a reliable opponent of stric@@ ter environmental protection regulations for a long time .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly passed on to block or delay regulation that resist@@ s the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels .
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the latest legal review of the P@@ ru@@ ble regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ al in Washington decided that the EPA administrator has exceeded his authority when he attempted to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama administration , the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leak@@ age .
in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt suggested that his revers@@ al of o@@ zone standards simply appe@@ aled to the willingness of the EPA to cooperate with States through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in previous administr@@ ations , the EPA often failed to meet dead@@ lines for carrying out and then waited to be charged by activ@@ ist groups and others , and in an agreement to set the date for execution , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who accused the EP@@ O more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in legal proceedings , and we take dead@@ lines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and the authority that gives it to us seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the EP@@ O statement said that P@@ ru@@ itt will eventually use his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; authority to delay and all other legally available powers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; to ensure that the provisions are based on solid policies and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Republi@@ cans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive revision of the o@@ zone rules .
a bill approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules for at least eight years .
the measure was not set up in the Senate yet .
the New York General At@@ tor@@ ney Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the coalition of states who had accused the EPA during this week , said the group inten@@ ding to maintain the legal pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conversion of the EPA - according to our complaints - is an important asset for the health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the over 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g that flows into their communities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new York has joined California , Connec@@ tic@@ ut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ian , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil o@@ zone is created when pollutants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources react in the atmosphere to sunlight .
the resulting smo@@ g can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people , and every year thousands of premature fat@@ alities contribute .
representatives of public health care and environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered over P@@ ru@@ pp &apos;s surprising course changes .
&quot; it is disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from those responsible for the protection of the air we breathe , &quot; said Lor@@ i An@@ n Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue to fight against the ideological crus@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump government to address environmental pollution and their particular interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tum@@ lingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
&quot; &quot; &quot; 750 Years of the Church of St. Hil@@ arius : on the occasion of the anniversary of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Berg@@ kirche &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the old cemetery area in Tum@@ lingen will be invited to a seren@@ ade on Sunday , July 16 , at 4.@@ 30 pm . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historic St. Hil@@ arius facility is a popular place to stay .
visitors to the sixth Bene@@ fi@@ z seren@@ ade can be en@@ chan@@ ted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in town have made friends and promot@@ ers of tum@@ ours their concern .
Walter Mart@@ ini emphas@@ ises : &quot; it is a unique village gem . &quot;
in 12@@ 67 the Chapel of St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in documents : Graf Hermann von Sul@@ z sold &quot; the mountain with the parish church of Tum@@ lingen and the Vog@@ tei &quot; at the Magi@@ ster Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver .
in addition to the former parish church , the wording of the document , besides the former parish church , was also a stat@@ ely courtyard , to which the church or the pat@@ ron@@ ate law belonged , not the other way round .
so there were also people there .
as from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freu@@ den@@ stadt dating from 18@@ 58 , apart from the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which are still visible today in the village of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; mountain &quot; is the third , the most beautiful settlement core of the village .
old maps from the period around 1600 substanti@@ ate these historical circumstances .
the right to pat@@ ron@@ ate arose from the early medieval church law .
a master who built a church , furnished and occupied with a priest remained the owner of this church and could also bequ@@ e@@ ath@@ ed this church .
associated with this was the right to use a priest or to propose a new pastor to the bishop .
there were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the Lar@@ ger of the two tore up at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly acquired bell sounded for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be handed over later during World War II in 1942 .
during the Thi@@ r@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the windows were ham@@ mer@@ ed and the bell parts were stolen .
the roof was le@@ aking .
in 17@@ 96 , French troops camped near the church .
they broke out the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
the remains of the church were threatened in 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery also served as the last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schwei@@ ler .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was enlarged and the Church of Hil@@ arion stopped .
only the bell tower was left .
in the New Year &apos;s Night in 18@@ 34 a storm broke down the steep@@ le and half collap@@ sed .
to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demoli@@ shed .
only the tower still existing today survived as a witness of the 750 @-@ year @-@ old church history .
today Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em maintain the Hil@@ arius plant as successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn .
as organizers , the friends and promot@@ ers of Tum@@ lin invite to the sixth seren@@ ade to the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle cemetery on Sunday , July 16 , at the sixth seren@@ ade .
this is organised by the Com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with contributions by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
the local leader Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann speaks the final word .
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 pm .
admission is starting at 3 : 30 p.m .
to conclude the seren@@ ade , a trunk will take place in front of the cemetery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows towards the forest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organis@@ ers take out the fantastic view . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ser@@ en@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
the organizers are hoping for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hil@@ arius facility , which is of importance for Tum@@ lings and Hör@@ schwei@@ ler .
the friends and promot@@ ers of Tum@@ our are particularly committed to their home care , as Ser@@ en@@ ade organis@@ er Walter Mart@@ ini reiter@@ ates .
association wants to appro@@ ve approval of wind turbines
&quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim we@@ ars himself &quot; does not see any legal pre@@ condition for the construction and has therefore turned to the coun@@ cil@@ or .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim we@@ ars itself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asked District Apostle Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to take back his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was illegal .
the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette no wind turbines could have been approved , as at the time in Vier@@ sen only at the city border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal there exists a wind power concentration zone .
in this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes exclusion of wind energy utilization for the rest of the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such zones should prevent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spar@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the landscape . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the city Vier@@ sen had decided a second wind @-@ force concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette just a few days earlier - but the district government Düsseldorf had not authorized the city because of a form failed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planning permission , the granted approval certificate is still un@@ lawful and therefore to be taken back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , Chairman of Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot; &quot; &quot;
state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art status : before the summer break , the City Council again approved the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette ; a permit from the district government is still pending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this respect , granting a permit for the construction of wind turbines is excluded under planning law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the receipt of the request .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letters have been entered into the circle Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes them for the occasion to test the matter again .
but they do not expect the procedure to be stopped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday didn &apos;t want to comment on the arguments of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the NEW Re , a subsidiary of NEW , plans to build four hundred meters high wind turbines on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette .
last year , the company , in which the city Vier@@ sen is indirectly involved , had signed lease contracts with the owner of approximately 65 hectares of land .
with the establishment of the four wind turbines , the power requirement of around 11 400 households is to be covered - this corresponds to about a fifth of the power requirement of all four @-@ person households .
the NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer , Vier@@ sen City Council gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines at the Lin@@ ni@@ ch wind farm near Aachen and a stake in a wind turbine in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the Kreis Hein@@ sberg district .
car and tractor crash together : woman dies in terrible accident
a terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 o &apos;clock on the L 3@@ 33 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was mort@@ ally wounded .
two more people were slightly injured .
the state road remained closed for hours .
according to police instructions , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch accompanied her car in the direction of the accompanying driving with her 53 year old mother as accompanying person the L 3@@ 33 in the direction of Bo@@ gel .
city and dealer plan &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend
bad Lan@@ gen@@ salz@@ a@@ er and people from the region are to re@@ discover the shopping facilities in the city center in September .
the business club and city administration want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to enti@@ ce the inhabitants to shopping in the city center .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as the chairman of the business association , Christian König , announced , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; home shopping &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weekend should sensi@@ ti@@ ze customers to what offers the own city provides away from the usual supermarket commodity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plan is therefore a market with regional suppliers , similar to the weekly market .
in addition , domestic companies should present themselves with their training places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the shops of the city center are to invite the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mit@@ ter@@ overnight @-@ Sh@@ oppen &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the campaign aims not only on residents of the city and the region .
in preparation , advertising spots on the radio , an internet video and printed bags , which point to the action weekend , be Christian König .
the Municip@@ ality and Industry Association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
the business association and the city are thus entering another stage of the project &quot; Attrac@@ tive City . &quot;
this includes new offerings such as the first &quot; active day &quot; to the well @-@ appointed Sunday , talks with all tra@@ des@@ men and propriet@@ ors , in order to move them to active participation .
attractive offers on Saturday and the wai@@ ver of parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer potential is to be re@@ developed or re @-@ opened .
this includes spa guests and tourists .
but also many local residents would have lost the city center while shopping out of sight .
in the end everyone would have to contribute to revi@@ ving the city centre - all the way to land@@ lords , the establishments of the whole city and clubs .
it was time for a network to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy that was partly wi@@ dened , king said in the spring .
Bir@@ git St@@ reich , head of the I@@ HK Centre in Müh@@ l@@ hausen condemned the first five Thur@@ in@@ gian cities to participate in the country &apos;s third country shopping day .
in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heili@@ gen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ ero@@ de .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; advertise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the appreciation of local trade and emphasize its importance for the common welfare of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action under the leadership of the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners makes it clear that every citizen can influence its direct surroundings with its purchasing behaviour .

only a few people were staying at the Min@@ neh@@ aha Academy building at the time of the holiday .
Tr@@ ump put under pressure after le@@ aked tran@@ scripts of telephone calls Mexico under pressure because of payment of the boundary wall
tran@@ scripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leader of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
on January 27 , Tr@@ ump called on a phone call with Mexican President En@@ rique Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to to publicly say that he would not pay for a planned border wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the US president described him because he had publicly den@@ ounced the wall . according to reports , he said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t tell the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump began his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall at the southern border of the USA , and s@@ wore to let Mexico pay for the project .
tran@@ scripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and disclosed a ten@@ se exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump told Mr. Turn@@ bull that a trade for the U.S. emig@@ rated to Australia was &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; &quot; bad &quot; and &quot; stupid &quot; and that the existence on trade , which was im@@ par@@ ted by the Obama administration , would make him look like a &quot; dump &quot; after he had proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees to the US .
Mr. Tr@@ ump finished the call after he told Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; that &apos;s the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot;
Mo@@ ore Ford massacre : activists perform rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice
a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mer@@ cury drove through a group of viewers in the Mon@@ roe countryside , Georgia , and rum@@ bled to the Ford Bridge of Mo@@ ore .
before the car , which had four black passengers and a white rider , could reach the bridge , a group of white men came out with ri@@ fl@@ es to block his way .
the leader of the mo@@ b - a middle aged man in a pin@@ stri@@ pe suit - took a long train on his ci@@ gar and looked at the wind@@ screen .
in@@ doors the in@@ mates moved in fear .
&quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; the man ro@@ ared .
&quot; get it out of the car ! &quot;
cri@@ es broke the silence when a young black man was drag@@ ged from the passenger seat .
thank@@ fully , this horri@@ ble scene played on July 22 is just a night@@ mare .
but when a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; Roger , &quot; almost all of them sounded very real si@@ ghs .
since 2005 Ci@@ tiz@@ ens have come back to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were yn@@ old by K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one ever was accused of murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is truly in@@ conceivable that in all these years , no single person was arrested - although we see them in our congregations , although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who assists in organizing the post @-@ delivery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a stain on a history , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former con@@ gres@@ s@@ man of the State Georgia and a life of may@@ ors .
it serves as a dramatic call to action for him and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ roe community that a injustice has never been corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want persecution , we want to finish , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we have to receive justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot get to healing and reconciliation until we receive justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a court physician will put a blanket on the body of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ate on 27 July 1946 .
according to FB@@ I files received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ roe and surrounding gra@@ ff@@ les were suspected in the Lyn@@ ching Process .
but none has ever been accused .
although the susp@@ ects have been on an open foot for decades , civil rights activists say that twice the motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court allowed the black citizens to vote in Georgia for the first time in the summer election campaign .
approximately at the same time as the choice st@@ ach according to data of the FB@@ I , the black color monitor Roger Mal@@ com a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , down during a fight - allegedly because of a woman .
Broo@@ ks said the rum@@ our in the city was that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby she wore was not of her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , so the FB@@ I .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her cous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
but when they reached the prison and approached the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b cir@@ cl@@ ed the car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison who prepared and ordered the kill@@ ings , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concludes an FB@@ I report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between state and local prosecution , which was not only involved in murder , removing evidence and obsc@@ uring the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks formul@@ ates it even more conc@@ isely .
&quot; it was an electoral massacre , &quot; he said .
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; if you let yourself be registered and if you vote , then this will happen to you . &quot;
for nearly a decade Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has conducted the annual report of Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their representation is descri@@ p@@ tive , touching and is rooted in a kind of deep rac@@ ism that many want to believe in America no longer exists .
it &apos;s hard to watch , and look even harder , but Gre@@ ene said that &apos;s the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ ch because we are confronted with the ug@@ liness in all of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I cannot relate to you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or don &apos;t want to hear what I &apos;ve done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rehear@@ sals for this year &apos;s production started in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen wh@@ ites and the rest black - pushed into a room and listened as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ rehear@@ sed overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is a co @-@ director here .
he has played the role of the boss @-@ clan member for years , but he said the role never becomes easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not that way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we don &apos;t want to return to those times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room , the actor Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sh@@ aw and Nick Ras@@ zy@@ ch , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , rehear@@ sed their lines .
the piece begins with Mal@@ com , who scre@@ ams and pus@@ hes him , fur@@ i@@ ously that he slept with Dor@@ othy with his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he , get away from my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
As@@ cona rep@@ lies the fire .
there is a break .
and then everybody ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laugh@@ ing lou@@ dly .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; he asked .
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still gi@@ gg@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just don &apos;t think that white people at that time --- &apos; he &apos; said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the other black performers &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you only have to hit the hard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R. &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and this is exactly where the energy shifts in space , a feeling of compan@@ i@@ onship replaces the discomfort .
everyone is busy trying to get this right , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene starts again .
this time , when Ras@@ cona says the N word , he says it sharply and with re@@ print .
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition ends violent and fast .
there are cri@@ es , shots and then silence .
a woman , dressed with a mour@@ ning dress , stands above the bodies of the actors and performs Bil@@ lie Holidays mour@@ ning glory of &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot;
her voice breaks with every second word .
about a hundred metres behind it , a group of about four dozen viewers wi@@ pes away sweat and tears from the eyes .
the audience is almost equally divided between black and white .
a couple came from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come down just the street .
they experienced Geor@@ gi@@ as oppres@@ sive humidity for almost eight hours , when Broo@@ ks leads her on a pilgrimage to the bur@@ ial sites of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point , the mur@@ ders have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when one stands in the same country where the Lyn@@ ch mur@@ ders took place , the air feels gh@@ ost@@ ly .
when the last notes of the song end , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the cor@@ p@@ ses .
children sit at their heads , record the fake blood and the silent body and whis@@ per each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they &apos;re not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a little boy mur@@ m@@ urs as if he wanted to remember . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it &apos;s over .
the actors throw away the ly@@ n@@ ch rope and wipe their tears off .
Brad@@ sh@@ aw embra@@ ces Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit that the clan member played .
Nick Ras@@ cona hu@@ gs two of his fellow players and then breaks down in their arms , the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks out with him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whis@@ pers one of the women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that this is not in your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you did that for a reason . &quot;
later the audience sat together with the actors for dinner .
a white couple from Atlanta are chat@@ ting at a table about the night@@ mare with a black pair that they just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky was struggling to find words that felt the performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is hard to hear these horri@@ ble words and deeds ... coming from people who look like you and do what they do because they look like you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the Lyn@@ x is still going on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Today this is called the only police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room , Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks &apos;s court looks at his table , he eats and re@@ members the civil rights .
he said he had started planning the performance next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the post @-@ creation is inspiring , as it describes the horror of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is so if we don &apos;t learn anything from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is condemned to repeat it . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ dämm@@ erung &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans in Bayreuth
in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf focuses on a colourful and fri@@ vol@@ ous st@@ aging of a gigantic six @-@ story backdrop .
the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by A@@ lek@@ sand@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) shows either a sh@@ ab@@ by street corner including the rest of the Berlin Wall and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Play@@ list and Ela@@ ine &quot; logo from the G@@ DR times or the New York Stock Exchange .
in front of it an open Mercedes classic car , in which the Rhine @-@ kill@@ ers pose as rock @-@ energies , or alternatively a Is@@ etta .
stack@@ ed oil barrels remind of Cast@@ or@@ fs Leit@@ mo@@ tiv - money , power and gre@@ ed - which is moving through his &quot; ring &quot; st@@ aging .
the three Rhine @-@ kill@@ ers - sung by Stephan@@ ie Hou@@ tz@@ e@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ize just like in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; wonderful .
c@@ ess se@@ duce Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , rip a cor@@ p@@ se into the trunk in Hollywood @-@ style and give the Kra@@ wal@@ o cli@@ que .
Stephen Mill@@ ing sings the majestic nasty Ha@@ gen that surrounds the aura of a wei@@ ght@@ box .
brutal the scene when he kill@@ ed Siegfried .
later Gun@@ ther ( Markus oak ) still needs to believe .
the audience ow@@ es it to the ensemble with strong applause .
Fo@@ ster , Mill@@ ing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski are solem@@ n@@ ly celebrated .
there is a big applause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows itself on stage for the first time - in view of the big heat again in casual leisure wear .
the performance was expected by Frank Cast@@ orf and his team of directors .
in 2013 he had to let go of a H@@ ellen@@ istic Pfei@@ f@@ concert , there were five years later great rejo@@ icing , in which the isolated &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; calls went down .
Katharina Wagner is pleased to have been happy about this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you notice that the audience has grown together with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a certain way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audience did not only create a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but also an understanding of whose view had grown .
I draw a positive ré@@ sum@@ é .
Max amount works as a volunteer
they work at several locations in their voluntary year .
where anywhere ?
quantity : usually in ford in the furniture exchange , once a week I am here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I have also worked on the school as an open day .
what are your experiences with this ?
quantity : it &apos;s a beautiful , wide spectrum that I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years , so a late @-@ time volunteer .
how does that come about ?
amount : I graduated from S@@ LC .
and then a civil engineer , let &apos;s say , successfully broken off .
I know for myself that it is the wrong for me and I want to do something else , work with people .
and then I asked myself what are you doing .
get a social year , there &apos;s an insight , you can see how it is on site , at the focal point maybe , really .
and was it like that ?
amount : I collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the social system in the winter semester .
I will study dual , probably in the Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne a social worker training and study in Ham@@ m at the university of applied sciences .
is it not unusual to have several different locations during the volunteer service ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it always depends where you make your FS@@ J .
it can be done from the old people &apos;s home to youth work - in all facets of social work .
with me it was very varied .
I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care .
for me it was just the right thing that provoked me .
I could see my own strengths and see how it really works .
other than in Civil Engineering ?
a lot : well , here it &apos;s not about calculating St@@ ati@@ ks .
one always has other people in front of the head , each having a very different story behind them .
whether a refugee or a teen@@ ager who has been taken out of the family - you must always take an individual look at it .
very interesting .
and you had no reservations at all ?
amount : I &apos;m not the guy .
it is an area that gives a lot .
lots of love , great kindness .
there are also negative moments , but life is like that .
Pear@@ son pl@@ ung@@ es further 3,000 jobs and pl@@ ung@@ es the dividend to rev@@ ital@@ ise business
the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday , will reduce further 3,000 jobs and cut their intermediate divi@@ den@@ ds by 72 percent , as another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure that the company is facing .
the job cuts , which the Director General John Fall@@ on announced , mainly for the end of 2018 and beginning of 2019 , will be in addition to his previous restructuring , where 4,000 positions have already been lost .
Pear@@ son announced plans to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) in May in a third cost reduction programme to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the fast step towards digital learning .
the company , which had sold its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann last month , said that the outlook for the financial year remained unchanged , having achieved an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year .
Kab@@ ul con@@ vo@@ y attack : NATO soldier killed at suicide attack
a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ vo@@ y in the Afgh@@ an capital Kab@@ ul , killed a NATO soldier and wounded several others , say officials .
five soldiers and one interpreter were injured , shared an explanation of NATO .
according to local reports , three civilians died in the Q@@ al@@ ag@@ h district .
the bombing is the last violence that hit Afghanistan this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at on Tuesday .
on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul .
in an opinion of NATO , it is said that the explosion on Thursday evening had happened when a common pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; man carried on impro@@ vised explosive charges . &quot;
the statement states that all injuries are in a stable state and are treated in the US military hospital on the air@@ field Bag@@ ram .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Tali@@ ban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ ing@@ ag@@ h is a great concern for the NATO troops in the nearby Bag@@ ram .
according to the United Nations , at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilians died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of them in the capital .
at the end of July , suicide bom@@ b@@ ings killed at least 30 people in a predominantly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul .
the Tali@@ ban said they had executed this attack .
on 31 May , a massive bombar@@ d@@ ment in the center of the city killed more than 150 people with the dead@@ liest milit@@ ant attack of the country since the US @-@ led troops pushed the Tali@@ ban away from power in 2001 .
the violence under@@ lines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump is considering increasing the number of U.S. troops that support military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that the suicide bom@@ b@@ ings in Kab@@ ul in recent weeks have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , their policies and , in particular , the reputation of President Ash@@ ra@@ f G@@ hani .
EPA returns Decision to Del@@ ay the Smo@@ g Rule by Beat
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has made a decision to delay the regulation of the Obama administration , repe@@ aled that States are obliged to cur@@ b the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this took place a day after 15 states su@@ ed the agency because of the step .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to push the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; o@@ zone provisions 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and said it showed the agency &apos;s commitment to work with states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and by responding to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA Chief Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt announced the intention of EPA in June to determine the o@@ zone regulations - in which pollut@@ ant emissions should be measured in a part of the country in order to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards - in order to delay one year by October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , filed suit on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has attempted to return a wide range of environmental charges imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that should boost economic growth according to Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , efforts have caused the set@@ backs of the democr@@ ats and nature conservation groups that are worried about the effects of greater emissions on public health . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA website says that inhal@@ ing air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reducing lung function and increasing respiratory symptoms &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such as asthma . &quot; &quot; &quot;
municipal council wants community space
at the end , the decision was clear : at two counter@@ parts , the municipal council of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ tz@@ els decided to set up a common room in the future retirement home .
prior to the discussion there is an important information : the purchase contract for the still lacking development part is signed , mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ ades reports .
although it may still take until the area of the church is owned by the church community so far , there is no plan of planning for the project to be st@@ em@@ ming from a private investor .
there is a discussion about a shared space for this .
one of the two investors still in the boat has offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with over 70 square meters of space for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the community ho@@ vers , such a communal space is not to be seen as meeting place only for the inhabitants of the sen@@ i@@ ent dwelling , but openly into the congregation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an example , the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kn@@ itting café &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made the round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision , which is already prec@@ eded by the provision of funds for the current budget , will be made possible by funding options .
the building is located in the renovation area .
the setting up of a common room would be , as reported by T@@ j@@ ades , by 60 percent of 30 percent .
the proposal looks to signal the investor that in this respect you don &apos;t want to disc@@ ard any bil@@ lets between the legs , the statement that both saddle - which is le@@ aning against the surrounding buildings - as well as pent roof - which reduces the height and makes the construction more economical - would be possible .
need@@ less to say , Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer writes , is this addition .
when it helps : it happens unanim@@ ously by the body .
it &apos;s not that easy at the common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela &apos;s call points to the many own buildings , with which one does not move so well , they are now saying : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am very hard with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger necessarily speaks for the common room - but absolutely against communal participation .
it sees behind it a cover@@ t subsi@@ dy to wealthy or even foreign investors .
this is not the case , as with the acquisition of the surface there is no subsi@@ dy , but I get a real equivalent in the case of doubt , is the counter @-@ speech .
the decision was made to appro@@ ve the proposed resolutions by three pro@@ pon@@ ents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it remains with two counter@@ parts in the original programme that Stefan H@@ aller sums up : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we sum up the decision , we make a huge step to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
collision with car : Rad@@ ler is thrown on the street
when crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycli@@ st was captured by a car in Gar@@ ath on Wednesday and severely injured .
like the police , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder was on the bike path of the road Schwar@@ zer towards Hil@@ den on the bike path of the road Schwar@@ zer .
the Senior wanted to cross the road at the height of the road Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer bush .
a passenger car driver who dri@@ fted in the same direction granted him priority .
when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder went on the road , he obviously did not take care of the on@@ coming traffic .
he met a car with a 66 @-@ year @-@ old assistant .
the man was thrown onto the street .
he suffered severe injuries and was brought to a hospital with a ret@@ ou@@ ster car .
FC Bayern Munich must ren@@ ounce the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup takes place without him : David Al@@ aba must su@@ ck the game against Dortmund .
with personnel care , the FC Bayern will be travelling to Dortmund for the first mandatory competition of the new season .
seven professionals are missing the title defender in the Super@@ cup against the Cup winner .
in front of the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 a.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) , the personnel disp@@ en@@ sers at the German Soccer World Record Champion Bavaria Munich are getting bigger and bigger at Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund .
trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti must refra@@ in from doing a du@@ el with the BV@@ B also on David Al@@ aba .
this was confirmed by the Italian on Friday .
furthermore , the Mün@@ ch@@ ners Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing .
for the five defe@@ ats over the past six months , An@@ cel@@ otti has held responsible for the physical condition and lack of balance in the game of his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The most important point is balance in the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last but not least , this was not good . &quot;
but the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory game of the season .
&quot; football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to play smart@@ ly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who expects a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; difficult , intense game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights attracts the fans .
the game is sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spectators , distributed the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) on Friday .
w@@ ander in the resin from star to star
&quot; &quot; &quot; the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be created in the Harz mountains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is planned by the Stern@@ warte Saint Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a Plan@@ etary Trail in Göttingen since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is coming to meet the visitor &apos;s need for information , it was said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he combines nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance .
the members want to set up boards along the planned route and inform them about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the first phase to 2018 the association plans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; easily accessible installations at five to six locations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
domestic demand is St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Sie@@ ber .
the information on the panels should be supplemented by internet .
this is why a good mobile network reception plays a role in the selection of locations .
accessibility is also a criterion .
later the Star@@ path turn will be extended by train .
&quot; on the Star@@ ry Path , the viewers experience a lot of worth knowing , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; explained the association .
they also learned why stars would have different colors or why a star light would be more lumin@@ ous than another , even though it was much far@@ ther away .
I will also teach in which con@@ stellation you find a selected star and when it is best to see .
the association has been operating the highest observ@@ atory in northern Germany since 2014 in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg .
according to the Federal Agency for Nature Conservation , the site in the Harz National Park ranks among the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a gal@@ axy with naked eye can be seen clearly .
since 2003 , there has been something similar to the planned star wer@@ age in the university city of Göttingen since 2003 .
starting in front of Geb@@ hard &apos;s Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the Plan@@ etary Trail leads up to the H@@ ain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; off @-@ terrestrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( village Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the stel@@ es with the individual planets - including the plug@@ to degra@@ ded to the d@@ warf planet at the end point - are positioned exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ inks to a sphere of 6.5 milli@@ metres in diameter , while the sun , which is exactly 75 metres away , measures 70 centimet@@ res .
the total distance of the planet path is about four kilometres .
while the light from Sun up to Plu@@ to requires about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour up to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
therefore pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the cosmos .
the march to the next fix would last half a year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who were to be on a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing fight in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated World Bo@@ xing Council Light@@ weight champion , went down the hall to welcome Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Bo@@ xing Organisation Super Spring@@ weight champion .
after Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory by unanim@@ ous decision on the former Four @-@ Di@@ visi@@ oning world champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time , both fighters are members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und @-@ list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How are you , champion ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I wish you good luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko is defending his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 pm on ES@@ PN .
when the couple posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mas noted that a possible show@@ down between fighters would be the &quot; perfect order of magnitude . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a former fe@@ ather @-@ weight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I got up for Bron@@ er &#91; to 140 l@@ bs &#93; but I &apos;m not that big .
I &apos;m small for 140 .
I want to come down to light weight .
and he must move on a light weight &#91; 135 l@@ bs &#93; and then we fight .
this is what the fans want .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko agreed .
&quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot;
client asked if it should be on Pay @-@ per @-@ View , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must fight with a 135 pound first debut this year , in order to settle a date next summer with Gar@@ cia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who will also be interested in the fight against the winner of Jor@@ ge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell after their lightweight title fight in the forum on September 23 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this fight could take place in pay @-@ per @-@ view mode because all fans have asked for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia , and later openly expressed himself openly to fight on the network that offers the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can create this kind of attention .
whenever they &apos;re ready ... &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said he considers Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an enormous fighter &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and he may take part in his Saturday fight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Lom@@ ach@@ enko was very much praised for Gar@@ cia and said that he thinks that the three @-@ fight champion from Ri@@ ver@@ side looks very slow , sorry Mi@@ key ... you wanted the K@@ o @-@ off . &quot;
Gar@@ cia said the focus was to show impact strength , then boxes .
both said they could feel the momentum that was built up for their own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the struggle that must be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I waited for the top milit@@ ants , and that &apos;s Mi@@ key . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will be a great fight . &quot;
four injured to tire plates
in the event of an accident on the A@@ 7 , four persons were severely injured on Thursday afternoon .
after the first information , the driver of an Opel Za@@ fir@@ a lost control over his vehicle shortly before the connection point of the market .
the car hur@@ led to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where it over@@ turned and then remained on the roof in the green strip .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were severely injured in the accident .
during the first supply of the injured by the ambul@@ ance service , the A@@ 7 was locked in direction north for about an hour , followed by traffic on the left side of the road at the accident site .
For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; timing chain works better &quot;
after the 2 : 2 season and@@ re Hoffmann hopes for the season op@@ ener against Braunschweig , that optim@@ ising the defense formation in Au@@ e points out points .
with the first match of the season Andr@@ e Hoffmann was satisfied with the result , if not the two oppos@@ ites would have been at the 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two oppos@@ ites too much , and we have to fit in au@@ e even better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the def@@ enders of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains the supply chain is to be further optimized .
and the For@@ tun@@ en don &apos;t want to catch a gate after a free fall .
&quot; for the future it will be so that nobody else alongside Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) will be on line . &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that after the experience in preparation with the supply chain , his team is better navig@@ ated than with the four chain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says his coach Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we have just in the supply chain on the half positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko Gieß@@ el@@ mann , who can build up well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prerequisite is , however , that we harmon@@ ise even better and we do not have so many play@@ bugs in construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course Hoffmann also drives to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you can talk about a failure of a successful start , you don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance could be okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we can score four points on Sunday and concentrate on the tro@@ phy , we will certainly be able to speak of a good season op@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his trainer wanted to know nothing about it .
&quot; I judge the start into the season only after six to eight playing days , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who does not want to talk about an advantage over Au@@ e just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be stopped pre@@ mat@@ urely because of a storm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can start the season practically with a home game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann , that the players from Au@@ e might be somewhat fres@@ her , as they could not have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against a promotion campaign in the bones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t know 100 % where they are currently standing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the defender of Fort@@ una . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the guests from the Rhin@@ eland as an easy favourite on Sunday attend the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we swe@@ ep them away , just because we are entitled to get under the first six is stupid , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive with only one defeat against Au@@ e from nine matches . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga which you have to hit from the start , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains For@@ tun@@ as executive coach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; to make such a statement would be arro@@ gant and arro@@ gant . &quot;
and so I don &apos;t want to experience his players on Sunday .
new results of the Swedish asylum seek@@ ers Review published
the latest results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , which were subjected to a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish authorities for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( Rä@@ t@@ ts@@ Medi@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) started the tests last year .
they should take a closer look at the assessment of age during the asylum procedure after the Swedish Migration Service ( Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et ) has been critici@@ zed for errors in ass@@ essing the correct age of some refugees who were minor .
to date , migration sales has sent 6,@@ 8@@ 80 cases to trial and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 .
ei@@ ghty percent ( 2002 ) were assessed as 18 or older , while in another 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency showed that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; possibly under 18 years old &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tests are conducted only in cases where the person &apos;s age is questioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results have been steady in recent months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t see a big difference in the statistics of the past few months , the figures are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , The Local magazine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high percentage of cases in which the person was judged as over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ er lied about his age .
in May , the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases that suggest that the person examined is 18 years or older . &quot;
when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bla@@ det examined the results published by Sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bla@@ det , she noted that in 243 of these cases the person openly said that she was 18 years old this year .
the method of medical age assessment , in which x @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MRI images of knee joints are made , which are then analyzed by dentists and radi@@ ologists , has also been critic@@ ised in some areas .
a scep@@ tic is the en@@ doc@@ rin@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work includes the assessment of the biological maturity of people to see whether they went earlier or later than usually through pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used .
judging the biological age in this way is very un@@ safe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we cannot fail to say , we should not do as if we could , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the newspaper metro . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gö@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency however defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of being an adult as an adult is low .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest risk is when the person is under 18 , in this case this is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
full in the Plan
the work on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg is proceeding well .
on Wednesday , a seven @-@ tonne concrete part was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good at the time , it &apos;s going great , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , construction manager at the Department of Public Transport and Transport in the Regier@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in April , work began at the same time on all three refur@@ bish@@ ment bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the building is scheduled for October and Lei@@ cht is sure that the schedule will be respected .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads across the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a concrete arch bridge made of concrete , which is covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 meters .
it was built in 1900 .
like the other two bridges , it has now come into the years .
in order to ensure stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly refurbished .
the other two bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red colored Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were erected in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10,@@ 60 metres long .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach on Wednesday morning on the northern side has a 1.@@ 30 metre wide and seven ton heavy so @-@ called bridge cap .
this is a side fast@@ ener that is also used as operating mode .
a 2.@@ 20 meter wide bridge cap is to be used on the southern part of the bridge on Friday .
then the pedestrian walk@@ way should be gone .
the special thing about this is that they are finished parts , a patent by the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges have already been fitted with the patented brid@@ ged caps .
special t@@ act feeling has required the laying of cables through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
this is because there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable that many companies are connected to .
the residents were informed about the project in advance of the work .
fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be f@@ ished first .
for the bridges between the building yard and the collecting point in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is one @-@ lane regulated by a traffic light .
for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach town entrance , the street in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotel &quot; Tann@@ en@@ hof &quot; and &quot; Si@@ eben Lin@@ den &quot; is fully closed .
the cost of the three parts of the bridge amounts to 700@@ ,000 euros .
the whole thing is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : in protest with the German potato salad
it is not so common that parties pull together , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , it comes together , which is otherwise only difficult to put under a hat .
the parties represented in the district of Vulkan@@ ei@@ fel ( CD@@ U , SPD , Gre@@ ens , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , left ) are part of a wide alliance that shows a peaceful flag on this day because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle , R@@ ond@@ ell , invites to the &quot; big election campaign &quot; according to the poster .
and well @-@ known names start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land forms the leading duo for the Bundestag election on September 24 , and the deputy chairman Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are on the spot for hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the Af@@ D @-@ lern , but rather demonstrate .
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains colorful . &quot;
originally planned was the city picnic under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; on the well ground , but now takes place on the parking lot underneath the R@@ ond@@ elles - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle .
a colourful picture that offers itself .
and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , President of the Forum A World and one of the leading organizers , is really pleased : &quot; great how many people came together here . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ur@@ Deutscher potato salad &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which the Af@@ D could eat without any problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police has ordered many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , showing presence especially at the station , which is only a few meters away from the venues .
how did the Af@@ D actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes of the Af@@ D Vulkan@@ ei@@ fel reports that he stri@@ ves for such an event and got the supplement .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had asked in Dau@@ n initially , but there was a cancellation because there were not enough parking spaces due to the built @-@ in Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kirchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now the R@@ ond@@ ell , Hom@@ pes is pleased that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can have such a beautiful event here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the good right of people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is also true : at 20 o &apos;clock on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz a band provides entertainment , in the Stad@@ thalle diverse speakers , among them the rh@@ ein@@ land pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ischen Af@@ D @-@ chairman Uwe Jung .
in the hall there are about 200 listeners waiting for the top candidate to vote for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the deputy chairman Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
the police presence remains unchanged , but until now , the officials had a quiet evening .
a little more than an hour is the Af@@ D event , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there is announced shortly after 21 o &apos;clock .
the police can move off - no special incidents .
tro@@ mb@@ one meets trumpet
a good@@ bye with the Wolf@@ acher tro@@ mb@@ on@@ ist Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is available in the series Has@@ la@@ cher Kloster@@ konz@@ erte die morgen , Sunday , at 8 o &apos;clock in the monastery church .
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov he gives a concert under the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or even &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Balkan folklore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meets classic German training with roots in brass music . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have held solo positions in European top orchest@@ ras .
thus Pet@@ kov solo trump@@ eter is the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is Sol@@ op@@ os@@ aun@@ ay of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
both combine the desire not only to cross the boundaries of their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres .
Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like in a new gown , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ der &apos;s &quot; world music &quot; unites with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; by N@@ ils W@@ ogram , combine classical , jazz and free play to an intri@@ gu@@ ing Gesamt@@ kunst@@ werk .
this cent@@ re@@ piece of the program was first performed this spring with great success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram recorded it especially for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ la@@ cher Klo@@ sterk@@ irche with its special acousti@@ cs is consciously included in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about her bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; some people love grilled cheeses and will eat it until the end of their lives .
but I want to try everything , &quot; said Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart about her bis@@ exu@@ ality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I bite into grilled cheese , I think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh that was cool , what &apos;s next ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most famous relationship between Hollywood stars was the twi@@ light colleague Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who finally dealt bitter@@ ly .
in spite of all this , the brunette Dar@@ stell@@ ess assured the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s B@@ az@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was in every serious love I &apos;ve known .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or do you think I &apos;d played it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after her separation , Kri@@ sten stressed that she was bis@@ exual : &quot; I have always lived du@@ alism and believed in it seriously .
so it has never interfer@@ ed or hin@@ ders me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I just never liked to be taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she especially suffered from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in school time , when she preferred to dress like a boy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that really hurt me .
when I was eleven I told me the children , I would look like a boy .
I really felt attacked , sc@@ ared and humili@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; girl , be proud of you ! &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially the public doesn &apos;t like to declare their love life : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people expect you to react in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and perhaps some call me ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like having to justify myself before the whole public . &quot;
West Virginia Gover@@ nor announces that he changes the party
the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening in a demonstration with President Tr@@ ump that he would change the party .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and many reflections ... today I will tell you as inhabitants of West Virginia , I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the rally broke out in jubil@@ ation .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republi@@ cans , &quot; Justice added .
&quot; as a trainer I would say that it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump previously promised a big announcement at West Virginia rally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not endor@@ se the democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton .
justice , which according to For@@ bes is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes states that he owns coal mines in five states and has inherited a coal business from his father .
it is worth approximately $ 1.@@ 59 billion .
in the meantime , on Thursday evening the Republi@@ can National Committee issued an explanation in which it said : &quot; the party change from Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a Democratic Party that would rather hin@@ der us than work to make our country great again . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the f@@ ew@@ est legislative bodies in history , the announcement by Gover@@ nor Justice is only the last rej@@ ecting a party which is from top to bottom without leadership and is unable to find a positive , engaging message , &quot; said R@@ NC President Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in a statement to the C@@ BS News .
co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; honest &quot; Russian exc@@ uses for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal
the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday , what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia for a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be resum@@ ed in sports .
Russian athle@@ tics leader D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ lac@@ h@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF conference on the eve of the World Ath@@ le@@ tics Championships , that the exile of his country was correct from the sport and that he was determined to fight the dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the athletes dressed in gold and silver med@@ als in competitions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite its comments , the IA@@ AF Congress voted for the maintenance of the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) had found evidence of state @-@ sponsored Dop@@ ing in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open reply today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF president Co@@ e to the repor@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognised by itself that it has experienced some quite hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E said he was also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleased &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re @-@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it was a very constructive day and I think progress was made , but Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to re@@ use Russia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the World Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships on Friday in London based on rigor@@ ous IA@@ AF criteria as neutral actors .
the head of the IA@@ AF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia needed to meet some of the criteria for re @-@ employment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drug tests are still inadequate and forbidden trainers are still free , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told repor@@ ters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
memorial service for soldiers cut off in Mali
during a funeral service in the Northern H@@ ess@@ ischen F@@ ritz@@ lar , around 1000 people of the two had thought about a helicopter crash in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security measures .
for an even un@@ explained crash , Minister for Defence , Ursul@@ a von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) , said nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they described the two opposite pilots as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts of their trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow before this highest sacrifice that they have provided in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she declared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from Nord@@ h@@ essen had died in Mali on Wednesday a week ago .
their coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and transferred to St. Peter &apos;s Cathedral in the F@@ ritz@@ l@@ burg cathedral on Thursday .
at noon , only the members of the church took leave .
after that , the funeral service began in the circle of the family , close friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr , as well as politics .
among them were H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and chief In@@ spec@@ tor Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
ro@@ ses lay down , the relatives stood by arm in arm on the coff@@ ins .
before the church , F@@ ritz@@ han@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a screen .
Minister of Defence of the Le@@ yen described the in@@ verse soldiers as &quot; highly decorated &quot; and sharpen@@ ed .
the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann took the flight operations of the helicopter tiger in F@@ ritz@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tiger pilots of his regi@@ ment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the regi@@ ment , to which the soldiers belong , explained : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this crew could not turn away the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; doubt about the UN Mission in Mali did not show Prime Minister of the Le@@ yen : the use is dangerous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he is also of great importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country by which we are only separated by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the funeral , the coff@@ ins were brought out of the cathedral .
when and where they are being buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information .
Prince Hen@@ rik does not want a grave near his wife
the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife .
this was what was told by the Royal House on Thursday .
traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in Ros@@ kil@@ de &apos;s cathedral church .
the sculp@@ tor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ agus for the two .
the Queen agreed with the decision of her husband , so she continued in the message .
where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried is still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would have liked to become king .
in 2016 he retired and also laid down the title &quot; Prince &apos;s Su@@ pper . &quot;
since Hen@@ rik did not get the title and function he wanted , he did not see himself as equal to his wife - not even after death , L@@ ene Bal@@ le@@ by explained , the chief speaker of the Danish royal house .
where the last resting @-@ place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be , is still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country he has worked for over the last 50 years .
the born Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ zo@@ at , son of a French noble family , met Mar@@ gre@@ the in London in 1965 .
he worked on the Th@@ ames in the French embassy .
during his later wife the sympath@@ ies of the people always flew , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand in its almost 50 years old rule .
in an auto@@ biography Hen@@ rik spoke about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival all I did was critici@@ zed .
my Danish was vac@@ ant , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk stock@@ ings instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises I smo@@ ked instead of Virginia tobacco and had the reputation to be the brand of company critical intellec@@ tuals , I could not hope for indul@@ gence .
I was different .
I seemed to be happy with this position and not ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these were two mistakes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l stri@@ ves for quick re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
Lower Saxony &apos;s Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) is after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority for a quick re @-@ election of the parliament , but he does not want to withdraw .
speaking on Friday for the dissolution of the parliament .
previously , the unexpected exit of a Green Party de@@ pu@@ ties from their state parliament in Lower Saxony had pl@@ ung@@ ed the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a severe crisis .
five months before the official date of the State Parliament elections , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its scar@@ ce one @-@ vote majority in Parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the former Green Party member El@@ ke T@@ westen combined the non @-@ nom@@ ination for 2018 in its constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( W@@ üm@@ me ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; she explained on Friday in Hanover .
group leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ur@@ ler wants to recommend his Group to record it .
thus , CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 seats in Lower Saxony &apos;s Land@@ tag , SPD and Green 68 seats .
so far , the ratio was revers@@ ed .
the new Land@@ tag will be elected as regular on 14 January next year .
Th@@ ur@@ ler said that the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether it could continue to go@@ vern in this situation without a majority .
Stephan Wei@@ l , however , considers it essential that the state parliament resol@@ ves its self @-@ resolution as quickly as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the state constitution also sees the possibility that Parliament President withdraw@@ s trust and chooses a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution offers several options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these opportunities must be legally tested , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Th@@ um@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one will quietly discuss all questions if they are legally tested . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ um@@ ler called T@@ wa@@ vy &apos;s step &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but something strange . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian himself stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a tra@@ it@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel very good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she described herself as a trailer of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens called for the apost@@ ate de@@ pu@@ ties to return their state parliament .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume , of course , that they return their land tag , which they have received via the green country list , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the President Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D Group president An@@ ja P@@ iel : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we deeply regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ westen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she deliberately decided not to pron@@ ounce any pron@@ unciation in the Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also against the background that there was no substan@@ tive differences , we cannot comprehend this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the SPD chan@@ cell@@ or candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the surrender of El@@ ke T@@ westen in Lower Saxony to CD@@ U as treas@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conduct of former Green MEPs in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the President of the Socialists and Democrats on Facebook on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly re @-@ elect the parliament .
leaving T@@ v@@ est costs Red @-@ Green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her pen@@ ultimate vanity and fru@@ stration give her personal interests before the well @-@ being of the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critic@@ ised SPD Secretary General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Sal@@ vation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony makes this dirty tri@@ cky game and tries to make political capital out of it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dutch CD@@ U president Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ um@@ ler wants to recommend his de@@ pu@@ ties to include El@@ ke T@@ westen in the CD@@ U .
the president of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , accused T@@ ests of distor@@ ting the outcome of the 2013 state election with personal career gifts .
at that time , the CD@@ U was strongest with the SPD and Gre@@ ens had a very thin majority of one vote in parliament .
Minister of Agriculture in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from gyp@@ sum , Herr Schmidt ?
Germany disc@@ usses poll@@ uted eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal pass ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
the Minister for Agriculture , Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) , is in an interview with the editorial staff of Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
Mr. Schmidt , How can consumers protect themselves from pois@@ oned eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumers to check the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp resolution .
the Bundes@@ länder , on the consumer protection portal www.@@ Lebensmittel@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , present the latest information on the affected eggs @-@ bat@@ ches .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if , after all , what we are currently aware of , a health hazard is practically impossible .
now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs get out of the offer - because the central role of the enligh@@ tened person is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
nevertheless my house has stopped immediately and has been in close exchange with the authorities of the countries since the announcement of the dis@@ integration of Germany .
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
the trade has the same responsibility as the manufacturers to ensure that the products sold are market@@ able and harmless to health .
if the residual content of 0.0@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded with eggs , these are not transpor@@ table .
un@@ loaded eggs can , however , be sold and consumed .
this time , not the factories are to blame .
are manufacturing companies and consumers sitting in the same boat ?
according to the state of knowledge , production companies do not have any immediate fault .
on the contrary , they have to reck@@ on with economic damages due to the presum@@ ed illegal practices of service companies .
as always , there are too few inspec@@ tors in serious cases .
is there only a lack of personnel or a logical competence ?
it was just the official controls that have revealed the process .
the truth is , however , that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled out 100 percent .
it is precisely because of this that a consistent explanation of such events and the transfer to the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in cases where crimes can exist are of decisive importance .
I have already stated many times that I expect a complete enligh@@ tenment from the responsible authorities .
is regular al@@ er@@ mis@@ m really necessary in food sc@@ and@@ als ?
consumers have the right to use only safe and market@@ able food .
if an un@@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly tra@@ ged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pan@@ de@@ fied means are manufacturers , traders and consumers in a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a matter of principle , the un@@ lawful use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide fi@@ pron@@ il in the keeping of food @-@ food @-@ supplying animals is not acceptable and must be terminated immediately .
this must be done consistently and with high pressure on all levels .
I expect all the competent authorities to explain the facts quickly and without gaps .
how the finance rules of football affect N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ imp@@ eded spending on European football clubs will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequences will come for Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main of UEF@@ A , as the leading organization that over@@ sees the European game has the power to forbi@@ d teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial fair play rules launched in 2011 by the UEF@@ A mean that PS@@ G will eventually prove that N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s transfer has been financed without major losses .
Barcelona has paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( 26@@ 2 million dollars ) to extract the Brazilian from its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary which will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to France .
PS@@ G can certainly make the money loose , so that N@@ ey@@ mar is signing and bringing it into a gal@@ axy of other stars , in view of the financing of the team by the powerful host family of Qatar .
associations are allowed to spend a lot of money on the acquisition of players , but they have to fight with legitimate sources of income that allow them to break even point in their business @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election as the UEF@@ A President in 2007 .
the former French player believed that clubs , who had taken enormous debts in their pursuit of success , effectively che@@ ated and ris@@ ked to ruin when banks or owners with@@ drew their support .
in 2011 FF@@ P moved from concentr@@ ating on the debt of clubs to monitoring their losses .
the change meant that the business model that Roman Abr@@ am@@ ovi@@ ch originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder business .
during the current three @-@ year period of the FF@@ P period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses amounting to EUR 30 million .
and although Plat@@ ini fell in favor by the pres@@ idency in 2015 , its successor , A@@ lek@@ s@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in , continues to sc@@ are away from excessive spending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surely FF@@ P is not dead and we will certainly reinforce the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , opposite The Associ@@ ated Press last week . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a flat rate , it can distribute the amount for invo@@ icing over the duration of its contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the redemption payments for the next five years can be accounted for by 4@@ 4.@@ 4 million euros in the annual financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 took the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the tough@@ est sanctions .
the PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( then $ 82 million ) , which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players .
UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that might attempt to out@@ wi@@ t their financial supervision by infl@@ ating their income by companies associated with the owners of a club .
while a Catalan company could sponsor the PS@@ G if the value of sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market rates , UEF@@ A would not be considered legitimate in@@ comes .
this is exactly what happened in 2014 , when the UEF@@ A decided that the P@@ SA sponsor@@ ship was le@@ aned by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that a part of PS@@ G payments could come to N@@ ey@@ mar about payments by the Organ@@ izing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 have argued that N@@ ey@@ mar will become World Cup ambass@@ adors and could easily find out such a maneu@@ ver for UEF@@ A regul@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that UEF@@ A will be more attentive to any attempt to circum@@ vent the rules . &quot; &quot; &quot;
UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G about N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , announc@@ ing on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .
they spoke on the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , as they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 generated a profit of more than € 10 million with a turnover of 54@@ 2.4 million euros .
the accounts for the last financial year are still to be published .
PS@@ G expected N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrival is a blessing for sponsor@@ ing deals , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot sales .
the association expects sales to rise by at least 30 percent after the signing .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players going and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s away by claiming that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the Club and the State , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the President of the La League , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS with regard to Qatar &apos;s last ownership of PS@@ G . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ar@@ senal @-@ Manager Ar@@ sene Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American Sports Ty@@ co@@ on , shares the reserve of La League against a state funded by an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football over the past 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is very difficult to respect the financial fair play because you can have different ways or have different interests if a country has such a great actor to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new Sch@@ og@@ gi@@ supplier
in recent years , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y has made board chocolate for Swiss .
now there is a close cooperation before a possible end : the airline is re@@ writing the contract .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Swiss spokes@@ woman Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rot@@ t confirmed on request from the news agency s@@ da a corresponding report of the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Northern Switzerland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to current planning , the airline will close a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products were checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; we are very satisfied with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; said the spokes@@ woman .
approximately 17 million small , red @-@ white fro@@ g @-@ panels packed at 14 grams per year distribute the flight atten@@ d@@ ants to the passengers prior to landing .
Swiss did not want to provide any information about the costs .
industry insi@@ ders estimate the volume of orders in terms of &quot; northwest Switzerland &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of approximately one billion Swiss francs .
but more important is the advertising effect : it is a prestigious order for a chim@@ ney manufacturer .
Swiss does not want to betra@@ y how many applicants will find it in the new tender .
but there are only Swiss manufacturers in question .
according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make an effort to renew the contract by the spring of 2018 .
for the s@@ da , the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not reachable for a comment .
Swiss chocolate tablets have been distributed since 2006 on board their flights .
prior to signing a contract with Mig@@ ros daughter , Barry Cal@@ le@@ baut has supplied the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hu@@ g .
Swiss had the opportunity to place the logo at two and a half years ago with the start of the collaboration with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline works with various Swiss chocolate producers .
on long @-@ haul flights the First Class customers are spo@@ ilt with goo@@ dies from the Con@@ fis@@ erie Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in Business Class passengers S@@ og@@ gi of Lin@@ dt and in Economy Class Sch@@ og@@ gi of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
Swiss Sch@@ og@@ gi of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , both in Business and Economy Class , also distri@@ butes on the short circuit .

nostal@@ gia goes to &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
this repetition of history is at the same time nostal@@ gic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 &quot; s , for the 90 @-@ year Gr@@ unge era ( when the pione@@ ers David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter chose the Sk@@ etch @-@ com@@ edy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , such as Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd , went to greater things .
as a cultural art@@ ef@@ act , it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era of permanent memories .
but as a fran@@ chise it feels like time is short .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; was surprisingly good , not just because of its absurd hum@@ our ( it contained an original story for a talking D@@ ose vegetable that was spoken by H. J@@ on Benjamin ) .
raising herself on the core of the g@@ ag - middle @-@ aged actors playing hor@@ ny children who grow up - nevertheless they managed to reg@@ ain the im@@ possibility of reg@@ aining the last part of the wi@@ t .
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults , who now play adults , is less emo@@ tionally rooted and his par@@ o@@ dy goes more to the watering principle , including a riff on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 &apos;s like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at one point , a character rum@@ bles through an Apple @-@ Power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the gra@@ cious C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now Roman@@ aut@@ or , has never forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) .
Victor ( K@@ en Marino ) still hasn &apos;t lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there is another crazy evil P@@ lot , included in Ron@@ ald Re@@ ag@@ an ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good successful impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always , the ex@@ positions are the best part of fran@@ chise .
it &apos;s a lot of fun to see the eternal young Mr. Ru@@ dd , who shows Matt D@@ ill@@ ons &apos;s under@@ side be@@ ard of &quot; sing@@ les , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old cra@@ cker .
it &apos;s the moments of accidental ma@@ dness that could heat this fran@@ chise as a sort of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series , until he achieves what I consider as his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose final scene will show the band how to visit the film premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
in the meantime , &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon reminds us of a different kind of nostal@@ gia : the revival of the Cold War from &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde , &quot; and even &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; with its East @-@ West Ring@@ struggle I@@ con@@ ography .
the com@@ edy created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Aless@@ andro Tan@@ aka , with Rh@@ ys Thomas , is the director of a bound TV series : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est , who fight for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the way of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism .
the main roles - a hard @-@ boiled Greg@@ or and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i whose di@@ alogues of Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a detailed producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt are synchron@@ ized in English .
it is an ingeni@@ ous idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice flags to watch ( the police sp@@ ends time watching chess on television , as Americans might do with football ) .
and the list of famous speakers - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ e Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - ensures a decent play &apos; Fin@@ de the voice out &apos; .
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is so much involved in the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desp@@ airing propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer wearing a Re@@ ag@@ an mask is involved - that it often plays like a single .
with six long episodes , it moves away , and the com@@ edy is not fast or frequent enough .
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective , &quot; who was reduced to a lower length , could better deliver his ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re , since Greg@@ or and I@@ os@@ ef repeatedly visit the American embassy whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ our a pile of ham@@ bur@@ gers .
the message for the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can do everything to feed for a money .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious roman@@ ian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even do it with our own recent history and with thei@@ rs .
strike against drug ma@@ fia in the country
the police succeeded in a blow against the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart , numerous objects were searched , as the public prosec@@ utor Con@@ stance announced on Friday .
at the same time , 15 accused were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and already issued arrest warran@@ ts against them .
in addition , the officials made large amounts of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms and several hundred thousand euros safe .
two persons were arrested at the same time in Italy .
against the two susp@@ ects of Italy there were German arrest warran@@ ts .
the two are probably extra@@ di@@ ted to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in the action .
a total of more than 300 polic@@ emen were in use .
the ma@@ fia &apos;s members are accused of organized drug crimin@@ ality , violent acts of violence , attempted murder as well as rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail .
since summer 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office has been investigating opposition to organised drug traffi@@ cking in Southern Germany .
between the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Con@@ stance and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Cri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had close contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
therefore , on Wednesday morning , large @-@ scale deployment was accompanied by four officers from Palermo .
the investigations included mainly Italian nationals with close relation to the Italian ma@@ fia .
a incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning , is likely to go to the bank account .
this way , large gaps in the foreig@@ ner register complain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data of citizens who should not appear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the foreign register in Germany shows considerable short@@ com@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this leads to some serious mistakes in asylum procedures .
according to a media report , the Commissioner for Refu@@ gee Management , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , drew attention to large gaps in the country @-@ centre register .
defici@@ encies in the data recorded there might lead to some serious mis@@ decisions regarding asylum procedures and deport@@ ations , warned in a manner in which the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; is present .
according to the data , ten million people with foreign citizenship are reported in the register , including 5,@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data is therefore administered by approximately 600 country nationals in Germany .
because the data has not been sufficiently maintained , data quality has not been good in parts so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in individual cases , data from 1921 were found , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of people who are no longer alive , or of citizens who have become German citizens and should not appear in the register anymore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incorrect data entries can significantly slow down reverse processes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the statistics on people who are sufficiently charged are EU citizens who do not have to leave at all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such false arrangements , however , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; led to a distorted debate on dealing with foreigners &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; according to the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the Federal Government has apparently begun sending refugee families back to Italy with under 16 years of age when they entered the country .
this comes from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; Neue O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rück@@ er Zeitung . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the paper it says that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BA@@ MF is conducting such procedures &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerning families with children - except infants and small children - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the end of 2014 , it was practically no longer possible , as the newspaper had a reference to the difficult situation on the ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin Agreement , it is responsible for refugees of the EU state to reach them first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a migrant travels to another EU country , this state can send it back to the immigration country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for reasons of reason@@ ing , the Office now writes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , the capacity for families with minor children in Italy has increased substantially . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Italy has given guarantees for the reception and accommodation of family guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) consider these promises sufficient .
other EU states would also send refugees back to the Dublin Agreement .
the internal political spokes@@ woman of the left @-@ wing group in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children thre@@ aten un@@ lawful shooting conditions and a threat to child welfare because of the short@@ com@@ ings in the Italian asylum system . &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 liters of blood from people living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach was already available for other people .
at least from the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday .
Jürgen Gre@@ ys , who now shares 50 litres of blood with his 100 donations .
traditionally , in the meeting of the Municipal Council , the congregation appreci@@ ates the four@@ fold willingness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is awesome how our bodies are laid out for this and we appl@@ aud the don@@ ors respect that their blood is available to strangers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under@@ lined mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a single blood donation helps several people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the District Manager of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Ma@@ isen@@ bacher , because the cann@@ ed foods are de@@ composed into their constitu@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three people could benefit from a blood donation .
at the same time , Ma@@ isen@@ bacher wrote about the actions performed in the spring of Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year , we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the DR@@ K District Manager . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the change to the theatre department obviously resulted in higher numbers of participants a few years ago .
in front of this , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Stra@@ w@@ ander numbered among the multiple don@@ ors and were honoured for 50 donated blood donations .
half as many book Herbert Ma@@ ir and Dor@@ oth@@ ee Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stefanie St@@ oll and Uwe V@@ etter spent ten times each 500 milli@@ liters of their life juice .
Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England will probably later announce that interest rates will remain unchanged , after weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened speculation about an increase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slu@@ gg@@ ish &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it retained interest rates on family income in the midst of a growing pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank &apos;s political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) agreed with 6 to 2 to hold interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with fewer members to increase interest rates this month , as weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase .
in its quar@@ terly inflation forecast , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and by 2018 at 1.6 % and warned that the pressure on budget@@ ary income would continue , with inflation expected to rise to just under 3 % in the fall .
but it sign@@ alised that interest increases would be necessary over the next few years in order to rein the inflation heated by the Bre@@ x@@ it and she said that the cost of bor@@ rowing would have to rise more than expected on the financial markets .
the members also agreed to withdraw part of the mamm@@ oth economic stimulus package published one year after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
it will take time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks as of February , although it was said that it is expected to make 15 billion pounds more available within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the central forecast of the M@@ PC , the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak at short notice , as the pressure on the real income of households continues to be bur@@ dened by consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the interest rates , they repeated that &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; would be required to cool inflation and a &quot; slightly larger &quot; scale than the markets expect .
the markets are currently forec@@ asting the first rise in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Bank stressed that increases would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limited &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank &apos;s growth forecasts for this year and next year are adjusted compared to the 1.9 % and 1.7 % forecast in May .
it has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound sli@@ d after these news vis @-@ à @-@ vis the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision for any change comes after the recent dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures damp@@ ened rising expectations on a rate rise and GDP in the second quarter rose from 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % .
growth is expected to remain at 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will recover slightly after the Bank at the end of the year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households that will be affected by rising inflation and minor increase in sal@@ aries , as the tigh@@ tening will first become even worse before it becomes better . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that monetary policy cannot &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; income in the coming years , but she added that wages will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of their three @-@ year forecasts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is also boo@@ sted by the increasing demand for British goods , which is attributable to the weak pound , which will offset a proportion of lower consumer spending .
the decision comes one year after the lowering of interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote that caused the sin@@ king of the pound .
the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years to fully achieve the prices and the economy .
prior to the last judgment of the Bank on interest rates , the call for interest rate rose increased as inflation increased pressure to hard @-@ pressed households , with three polic@@ y@@ makers calling for an increase to 0.5 % in July .
inflation has dropped from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said this was expected and will put it back in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said exceeding the ratio to its target of 2 % was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wholly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; attributed to the weak pound . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director at Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ gage Bro@@ kers said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of recent swa@@ p rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to be more competitive again , as len@@ ders are looking lou@@ dly for businesses and want to end the year in a positive way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the market looks particularly good for those in whom the existing deals run out and the new mort@@ g@@ ages finish , and many with toll @-@ free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) to prescri@@ be controversial HIV drug 10,000 people
patients will receive access to a &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV prevention treatment starting in September after a fight against the High Court against the funding of the drug in the N@@ HS .
N@@ HS England announced that pre @-@ posi@@ tional pro@@ phyla@@ xis taken before sexual intercourse can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , now from healthcare to a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he agreed to finance the trial after the Appe@@ als Court confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court last year according to which the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it .
the chess train announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England CEO Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as &quot; important new intervention , &quot; while the National AIDS Trust ( NA@@ T ) described it as &quot; decisive moment . &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d will be the first to allow people to register , and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 .
pre@@ posi@@ tional pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a consequence of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces HIV transmission in inf@@ ect@@ ant risk .
pre@@ p before sexual intercourse means that just enough medication is present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection .
such medications can be taken any day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse .
those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexu@@ als and individuals with HIV @-@ positive partners who have not been successfully treated .
in clinics , appropriate participants will be identified who agree to the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment .
people who live in England and registered with a family doctor can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sexual clinic .
the program will be £ 10 million and N@@ HS UK signed a contract to supply the medicines this week after an international competitive sourcing .
the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting and implementing clinical evidence , as it is used on a large scale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said St@@ ev@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should supplement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades of progress in cop@@ ing with one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National AIDS Trust ) said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pre@@ p , when targeted at vulnerable and vulnerable people , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic .
from September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded trial in England to develop a new instrument which is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiations with a partner , which leads to the improvement of many , many lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ian Green , Chairman of the Board of the Terr@@ ence H@@ ig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the priority must now be that the study is carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now , as the pre@@ p test medicine was pro@@ cured , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , Minister of Sh@@ adows , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the start of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delay and hes@@ it@@ ant implementation by the government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and ending the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to the understanding of the advantages of pre@@ p .
now it is important that this study is carried out as soon as possible throughout the country in order to protect people who are HIV @-@ infected , and that it will contribute to the completion of the dis@@ semination of HIV in society . &quot;
living the big life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a real estate passion , moved from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to Ear@@ ls Court Apartment in 2014 .
it is on the first floor of an elegant queen Anne terrace - and it &apos;s a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne did not pack her bags and sold them .
&quot; before that , I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; says Jo@@ anne .
&quot; I searched for something comparable to my price .
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and it had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in love with her and made an offer this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot has been completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one bedroom property with a ne@@ sted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Jo@@ anne wanted storage space and an mezzanine level to make optimal use of the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .
that was my requirement , &quot; she says .
for this purpose she commissioned the architecture and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use the 12@@ ,5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other , so the architec@@ tonic challenge was to create an intermediate floor in which one could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to solve the problem .
&quot; the steel work is quite complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stack@@ ed on top of each other without having to bend down . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not just about building a simple platform , but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement made it possible for Er@@ fan to place two rooms at full height - with a lot of additional drama .
for the mezzanine , a classic copper light window from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down through the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area .
mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage ser@@ ge mou@@ ll lighting set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role in the addition of theatre , space and light .
at both ends a short corridor is mirr@@ ored to let it work longer .
in the kitchen , the mirror feels like a window into another room .
at the entrance , mirr@@ ored units offer space for all the cutlery and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .
folding kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bit of engineering plastics went inside , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Er@@ fan , by the steel reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important , so it &apos;s very easy if you push the door . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage space Jo@@ anne could gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is appreciated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the soil size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here they have managed to enlarge the floor space and at the same time use high @-@ quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things that touch you and which will help create emotional ties in a home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t love the electrical outlets in the walls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are important , but they don &apos;t play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square footage of something standard in something quite amazing .
in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave this .
brothers are fighting for $ 500 million real estate empire
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a struggle for one of the largest real estate imperial Victori@@ as worth over $ 500 million .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and designer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their assets are to be divided .
Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp debate on the separation takes place in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers acquired 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , accumulated since the family purchased a store at Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood in 1973 .
there the West@@ co je@@ ans founded and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
this money has been invested in real estate , and De Lu@@ tis portfolio now includes offices in the city center , the development areas of Brun@@ swi@@ ck and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping m@@ alls in the suburbs .
according to an agreement with her late father , Col@@ in - described by Paul as the &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the De Lu@@ tis family - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third .
a court file says that this means that Col@@ in owns $ 3@@ 16 million and Paul has a value of 176 million dollars .
the distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be problematic for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the divisions proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I thought for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in a first Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday , after several failed negotiations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place .
the Brothers now also struggle for control over the existing business - from which Col@@ in , like Paul claims to have excluded it .
Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but acc@@ uses Paul to in@@ compet@@ ently manage some possessions .
in an early Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Italian heritage dict@@ ates that the family is the most important priority , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost increases in the event of hundreds of pages with aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , emails and reports from companies including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck C@@ ram@@ er , and with leading lawyers , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and both parties .
Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delic@@ at@@ ess@@ ens from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brun@@ swi@@ ck in the early se@@ ven@@ ties .
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property in which Col@@ in opened the first je@@ ans shop of the family .
Col@@ in says that he started West@@ co when he was &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a small child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to share their property with their sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land before judgment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis group of companies , whereas Col@@ in claims that Mark has paid $ 10 million in the aband@@ on@@ ment of the company and Luke 26 million dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark were , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Paul , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had become bitter about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in with@@ held himself very much , although he was a former AF@@ L member and after a biography of 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire the best friend of the TV star .
Fair@@ fax Media contacted Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Col@@ in answered by SMS , to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really can &apos;t say much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the case is in front of the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul chose to acc@@ use me and to draw our sur@@ name through the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 , Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill his brother &apos;s demands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and me to end up in our current quar@@ rel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , adding that he is still hoping for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday , this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our affair will be solved by the courts in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Col@@ in wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ um@@ ps of new Chief of Staff is planning to restrict the president &apos;s media abst@@ in@@ ence .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kel@@ ly can actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
Poli@@ tico reported that the White House Chief of Staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump , including news media reports - hoping to hold the boss on a more constant course .
here is a piece of repor@@ ter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kel@@ ly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met with senior employees on his first working day , he posed a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps White House that he wanted to repair : bad information that comes into the hands of the President .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kel@@ ly told the staff that information should flow on him - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame Tr@@ ump by monitoring his media diet .
President Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s relationship with television dates back decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if candidate Tr@@ ump was angry because of unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of jobs that were to be persu@@ aded , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the former election campaign consultant Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February to Poli@@ tico . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the key to keep Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter &apos;s habit under control , according to six former election campaigns , is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s Twitter habit was ever &quot; under control &quot; is ridi@@ culous .
maybe these campaign officials don &apos;t know what we don &apos;t know about others - that Tr@@ um@@ ps T@@ we@@ ets would have included more fuel without their interventions .
we will probably never know anything about twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump has not sent .
if his staff managed to keep trouble away from him several times , their efforts paid off .
but no one has consistently been able to prevent dr@@ unk@@ y controversy .
part of the problem is that people in a White House , which is composed of competing parties , always try to present their own agenda by presenting Tr@@ ump Material that potentially promotes their views of the world .
Poli@@ tico - busy with this story - reported in May about the pre@@ dil@@ ection of advis@@ ers to bring doub@@ t@@ ful information to the president for strategic reasons .
this was an example described by repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former Tr@@ ump officials say that Tr@@ ump can react like a volcano to negative press cli@@ pp@@ ings , especially those with damaged le@@ aks , and that he tries to find out where they originate from .
this was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone accused the President of a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet pro@@ voc@@ ateur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy Chief of Staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; to be the source behind a he@@ ap of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House .
although Johnson has been permanently banned from Twitter for ch@@ ic@@ ane , or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has expressed false alleg@@ ations in the past and has rev@@ oked them .
Tr@@ ump read the article and started asking employees about Wal@@ sh . &quot;
Gold@@ smith added that the then Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work . &quot;
how did that work ?
Kel@@ ly tries to do the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove to be more effective than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his im@@ pul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ers are still striving for influence .
these imm@@ utable factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
most sought after criminals get mail from Euro@@ pol
since the address is unknown , the help of the population is wor@@ shi@@ ped and hoped .
the police across Europe sent post cards to dangerous criminals in this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards .
since the addresses of the sought @-@ after criminals are naturally not known , references from the population are hoped and asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Euro@@ pol told on Friday the action followed by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU Most Wan@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Advent Calendar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the experiences would have shown that there were many fle@@ eting hidden in vacation destinations , called Euro@@ pol .
21 post@@ cards for sought @-@ after criminals from 21 EU countries have been put together .
since 2016 there has been the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ asis , more than 2.5 million times it has been viewed .
36 of the online search@@ lights could be arrested so far , at least eleven of them due to evidence after publication on the website .
travelers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; Million@@ aire &apos;s Series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est land@@ lords of the West Mid@@ lands are again with some determined travellers on war foot , who have negotiated a mo@@ at pulled out by the community to rec@@ laim a field in front of their man@@ sions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the passengers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ avans on a field outside a prosper@@ ous road of Soli@@ hull , which is called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; million@@ aires &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they brought horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters after they were thrown out in May without being deter@@ red by a tren@@ ch dig@@ ged by the Council in order to prevent their occurrence .
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defense posts and pressed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; angry residents have pushed the Council of Soli@@ hull to say that it is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; an anonymous inhabit@@ ant said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they went there on Monday evening after they were forwarded by Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw stones on the p@@ asser@@ s @-@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Council has to be forced by shame to implement it , as it was useless in dealing with the problem .
the travellers stayed there in May , were moved on and are back now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; more came yesterday evening , probably even more today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by holding long teachings to protect their parks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I live on Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I am not happy to continue to pay my com@@ mon@@ place if the Council cannot even stop it . &quot;
a resident who didn &apos;t want to be called said : &quot; it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , we just saw the last round of these travelers , just to be pl@@ under@@ ed by another round .
the figures have increased this time and you even have seen a horse in the park area . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ woman for the Council of Soli@@ hull said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the ground beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and cooperate with the police of Soli@@ hull . we take the necessary legal steps so that they move on as quickly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible report anti @-@ social or criminal behavior to the police by calling 101 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this helps create a picture of the situation in which the Court must examine when we present our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
made of bir@@ ch yard becomes Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is located in the former Hotel Birken@@ hof .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stadt is currently being renovated and will be re@@ opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closure of the hotel Birken@@ hof by the former Ambiente operating company l@@ t@@ d. on April 13 , 2014 some 30,000 overnight stays per year were lost and also income by the tourist tax .
in the fall of 2014 , in view of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees who came to the district , the hotel building was offered to the Regional Office as a collective housing , which provided controversial discussions .
the city prevented the placing of asylum seek@@ ers by the establishment of a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disputed at that time in the Municipal Council .
but above all the mayor &apos;s mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious seek@@ ers at the house .
he should be right .
the former Hotel Birken@@ hof has acquired the former Hotel Birken@@ hof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a home of the three @-@ star Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ stadt building .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ zab@@ era and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
hot Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the former Hotel Birken@@ hof you have been building sh@@ utt@@ les in front of the entrance for some time , and when you enter the house , it becomes clear how extensive renovation works are carried out .
the floors were torn out , ceilings partly broken down , old bath@@ tu@@ bs are removed from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
there is much to do until March .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s actually a nice hotel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style .
the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are installed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything should later be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beautifully citizen @-@ na@@ ï@@ ve &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make a gem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room are included .
one does not want to position itself at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on a higher downtown level , Sch@@ erer stresses .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise , with about 60 rooms , wants to set up , explains Sch@@ erer .
both individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business@@ men should feel at ease in the hotel .
he has already held talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Director of Tourism Michael Kr@@ ause , Sch@@ erer .
the ideas of the city are identical to those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
after the level of investment , Thomas Sch@@ erer doesn &apos;t want to define exactly .
just under a million euros , he reck@@ ons .
the exterior installations are also brought to the front man , which is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard , there is a large terrace which will be accessible from the restaurant that is open to the public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia Aff@@ air : us Special Issu@@ er sets up Grand Jury
in the Russian affair around US President Donald Tr@@ ump , special issu@@ er Robert Mu@@ eller allegedly appointed a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent weeks , the body has taken up work , wrote the Wall Street Journal , calling on people familiar with the matter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the paper took the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller had wi@@ dened and intensified his investigations .
the station CN@@ N reported that there are already initial charges of the committee in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ um@@ ps of the oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. intelligence agencies have been acc@@ using the Krem@@ lin for a long time to have pur@@ pos@@ efully interven@@ ed in the presidential campaign in 2016 .
Mu@@ eller investigated whether there were agreements between Tr@@ um@@ ps election campaign team and Moscow .
in the focus of the investigation , several men were to stand who acted as advis@@ ers to the Republi@@ cans in the election campaign .
according to reports , Mu@@ eller took a closer look at more and more tr@@ um@@ ps in a private and business environment .
a few weeks ago , the &quot; Washington Post &quot; wrote that the special issu@@ er Tr@@ ump personally moved to the centre and under@@ took the accus@@ ation whether the president could possibly obstruc@@ t the judi@@ ci@@ ary .
the main task of Grand Jury is to examine present evidence in possible crime cases and decide whether to be charged .
Grand J@@ uries are therefore also called anchor chains .
most of the time they are switched on if they are larger and controversial cases .
the procedure is always carried out behind closed doors .
the Panel can also be turned on by the public prosec@@ utor to invite people to inter@@ ro@@ gation under oath .
according to the broad@@ ca@@ ster CN@@ N , invitations have already been issued which revol@@ ve around the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
people who were involved in the meeting were called upon to testify , it was said in the report .
they should also provide documents .
in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. , Tr@@ um@@ ps was also a consultant and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ us@@ h@@ ner as well as his senior election campaign director Paul Man@@ a@@ fort during the conversation .
legal experts stated on Thursday evening on US television that the setting show that Mu@@ eller would not intim@@ id@@ ate himself in his work and that if necessary , he wanted to act quickly .
but it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the charging of an accus@@ ation .
nevertheless , the establishment of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause of concern for President Tr@@ ump .
in the midst of the new revelations , on Thursday evening , the president used a speech in West Virginia to portra@@ y the Russia affair as a campaign of its political opponents .
&quot; Russia history is a total invention , &quot; said Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the subject gives democr@@ ats a way to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; feel good &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because they have nothing else to talk about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his Special Ad@@ visor T@@ y Cob@@ b stated in a statement that he did not know anything about setting up a Grand Jury .
but they usually work secretly , he stressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the White House supports any action that accelerated the work of the special agent in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former FB@@ I chief James Com@@ ey said three times that not against the president . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have no reason to assume that something has changed , it was stated in the explanation .
but Mu@@ eller had only been used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of this root , accus@@ ations against Tr@@ ump have become loud ; he wanted to hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Com@@ ey said in June before a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump asked him to set up the investigation against the national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n .
the president is under great pressure because of the investigation .
following the presentation of US media , the White House collected material against the special issu@@ er and its employees .
this triggered speculation as to whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller wanted to dis@@ miss .
unlike an independent investig@@ ator of the Congress , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair around the later retired President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theore@@ tically be fired up by the President of the Ministry of Justice .
several Sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a move .
two groups of Republi@@ can and Democratic sen@@ ators presented the bill on Thursday that the special issu@@ er could not be dismissed as easily as possible .
Antar@@ c@@ tica : giant ic@@ e@@ berg advances in Antar@@ c@@ tica
in the western Antar@@ ctic , a gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg of the almost seven @-@ fold size of Berlin from the Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s has solved itself .
this was announced by the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred We@@ gener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the col@@ os@@ sus , which weighs over a tri@@ l@@ lion tons and 5@@ 800 square kilometres , is now driving to the north and will probably need two or three years until it has mel@@ ted .
with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the biggest ice gi@@ ants that researchers have registered over the past three decades .
a danger for human beings does not eman@@ ate from him .
the extent to which climate change has played a role in the demoli@@ tion of the ic@@ e@@ berg is unclear .
in total , however , there has been a series of unusual break@@ through@@ s in the region for around 30 years , writes the US Research Center for Snow and Ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a fact background .
according to many researchers , this could be related to global warming .
the now broken col@@ os@@ sus was previously a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s .
Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by large glaci@@ ers .
it therefore continues to grow into the sea and breaks out regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is located south of South America almost at the head of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
North of this Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ ses was disturbed by the balance of wa@@ xes and breaks some years ago .
a complete Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is dis@@ car@@ ded there , writes A@@ WI @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
there is some evidence that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is in danger , because the front edge has never been withdrawn as far as it is currently .
in addition , the iron plate is under tension and can fall apart if a piece is broken down at a key point .
melting of Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s and Eis@@ berg does not increase sea level because they float on the water and ice as much water as it flows after melting .
however , the loss of the ice shelf leads to that the glaci@@ ers can flow directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before .
this could possibly increase sea level , however only to a small extent , writes the British research project to observe Antar@@ c@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) .
according to A@@ WI , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is the fourth largest ice shelf in Antar@@ c@@ tica with nearly 50 000 square kilometres .
at the crossing from the mainland , it is up to 700 metres thick , at the front edge to the free ocean some 200 meters .
there it breaks out regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural phenomenon and is not aware of any direct link to climate change , the ice shield comes into a more dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y of British S@@ wan@@ sea University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the records , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he affir@@ med . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among scientists , it is disputed whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s will now grow back or come back in the long term and possibly coinci@@ de , said his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last decades .
even though these researchers do not lead the demoli@@ tion of this gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg to climate change , many ice @-@ sn@@ u@@ ffs of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have fallen apart in recent decades .
this long tip of Antar@@ c@@ tica extends towards South America .
according to the British Antar@@ ctic Survey research programme , the Antar@@ ctic Survey has declined 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s .
the increase in temperature has contributed to the decrease .
the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has been heated around three degrees in the past 50 years and therefore number in the areas where the temperature increases the fastest .
CD@@ U wants Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f at the staff
because it becomes increasingly difficult to occupy vac@@ ant positions , the CD@@ U calls on the employers &apos; association to become more attractive .
just before the summer break , the chal@@ k@@ day 41 places new jobs in the administration .
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 apprenti@@ ces have their first working day behind .
the apprenti@@ ces at the circle are obviously very sought @-@ after .
around 6@@ 20 applications were recorded for the places that were to be published this year .
nevertheless , the circle continues to lack staff in order to cope with the increased demands and tasks .
currently there are still 50 non @-@ occupied places in the district of M@@ ett@@ mann .
we are looking for doctors and engineers , as well as general management forces .
the CD@@ U now wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the administration should develop a concept for personnel recruitment and personnel development according to the wishes of the parties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is not only to meet short @-@ term demands for skilled workers , but to counter@@ act the future @-@ oriented approach of applicants .
the overall concept should orient@@ ate in@@ ward and out@@ wards , show concrete measures for cross @-@ entran@@ ts and include an education campaign , demand CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
that sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personal problems that you didn &apos;t know before .
other cities recru@@ it good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are talking about a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of public employers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this requires a large number of employees who leave the service for disease or age reasons .
so high time for action so that even more places remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter Völker , leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the common application with his party .
he took care of a fist @-@ thick surprise even in the day of the circle , when he publicly challenged the st@@ aff@@ ing of staff and struck the rest of the parties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people want all possibilities to be checked , which allow an exit from the municipal employers &apos; association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do not come to a satisfying solution at short notice , the district administration should strive for a house tari@@ ff in cooperation with the county @-@ affiliated towns , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pe@@ op@@ les . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus the CD@@ U , the employees and officials are trying to pay better than it actually fores@@ ees the tari@@ ff statement for the Public Service .
the sal@@ aries are currently exactly dict@@ ated , increases or more money is only available if you switch to a higher level that is oriented towards career years .
but the tasks of the circle grew more and more in recent years .
only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stitution protection law .
not least because of the increasing number of asylum seek@@ ers , coun@@ cils Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy exac@@ erb@@ ates the tone to NGO migrants &quot; rescue boats
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned NGOs that use lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they are not allowed to continue this unless they abide by new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue working , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said interior minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came a day after the Italian authorities conf@@ is@@ cated a boat of the German auxiliary organisation &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; because their team had worked effectively with human traffi@@ ckers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for a year , refused to express detailed alleg@@ ations of the Italian Amb@@ ro@@ gio Carto@@ sio prosec@@ utor .
&quot; for us , the saving of human life is our top priority . so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; said the organization in a statement on the social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only judge all accus@@ ations currently raised after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had supervised the boat from &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , since October .
it is thought that its crew takes din@@ gh@@ y migrants aboard , which will be delivered to them directly by human traffi@@ ckers , and that the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can depart so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such meeting took place only 1,3 miles in front of the Libyan coast , according to the prosec@@ utor &apos;s file , whose content was published by Italian media .
the occupation is suspected of being over@@ thrown by the authority of the Italian Co@@ ast@@ guard , the rescue missions in the area for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives .
under the Code of Con@@ duct , boats such as the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta must first of all have an Italian police officer who monitors their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far been prepared to adhere to the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable as they would not bring any &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; significant changes or disabilities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel Prize @-@ Lau@@ re@@ ate Organization is Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
Minn@@ iti has now said that the number of migrants arriving in Italy after the rescue measures has declined sharply in recent weeks , which indicates that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast@@ guard and co @-@ operation with the local may@@ ors have borne fruit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe .
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
nine female bi@@ kers , the &quot; Berlin out@@ post &quot; and two guest drivers met at Wach@@ en@@ heim in the northern Pal@@ at@@ inate to enjoy Tri@@ als and sights for four days .
three friendly guides were available for this purpose .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer Tal proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est from Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour took place at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to St. Michael &apos;s chapel above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
look@@ out points followed , partly on towers , of which one could look far above the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald and the up@@ stream plains .
in between there were always longer asc@@ ents , for which long tri@@ als rewarded .
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to Sal@@ ine and to the folk festival Wur@@ st@@ markt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; again the view point re@@ ared at the look@@ out point , connected by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flo@@ wi@@ ge &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the last two days many al@@ timet@@ ers were announced again .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and refu@@ ges brought welcome breaks .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim , the bi@@ kers at@@ m@@ ated healing br@@ ine in the open air inhal@@ atorium .
Neu@@ stadt was also contro@@ led .
after 17@@ 3 kilometres and almost 4@@ 500 metres altitude , the group got to know the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald from its best side - sporty and cul@@ turally .
console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ liga to@@ oling for e @-@ sport
are the sports stars sitting in front of computer consoles in the future , rather than competing in wind and weather across the stadium ras@@ ps ?
the fact is : e @-@ sport has long become a serious business , a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high g@@ ages included .
these have also recognized the first Bundes@@ liga clubs , which are increasingly engaged in this field .
the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sport department in mid @-@ July and took two pro@@ s for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to inspire all new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says CEO Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Some clubs are still rising on this train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
next weekend , FIFA World Cup in London organizes the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; where gam@@ ers from different clubs compete against each other .
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven qualified for example .
Robin D@@ utt also sees great potential in the e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen is now advis@@ ing an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; real football must deal particularly with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds , that young people will continue to go to the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old .
and : the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian ones .
with prominent e @-@ athletes under contract it is possible to be present online far more often in these markets than to send the Bundes@@ liga team to Asia once a year .
what is it all about ?
at E @-@ Sport , computer games such as &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or the FIFA soccer game simulation will be fo@@ stered at competitive level .
as in normal sports , Li@@ gen has long since become established in which the pro@@ s are competing against each other .
and E @-@ sport is already part of the official program in the Asian Games 2022 .
but is it a real sport at all ?
for many , the idea is certainly getting used to getting used to it .
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ ie has also dealt with the question for a long time .
for the professor at the Deutsche Spor@@ th@@ ochschule in Cologne , e @-@ sport is a sport because it is competitive and showing many biological and physical reactions which can also be found in classical sports - for example increased heart rates , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes .
in addition , it needs cognitive abilities , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a quick reaction .
professional gam@@ ers should train not only the console but also their body and pay attention to the nutrition .
&quot; the fit player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but F@@ rob@@ ie also sees problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing becomes increasingly a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls were difficult to perform in online games , and in the scene the structures of classical sports were missing .
the scientists emphas@@ ise the high integr@@ ative effect of e @-@ sport .
players are internationally on the move , that &apos;s like a big global family , there are no cross @-@ cultural barriers .
a study by Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts rapid growth in E @-@ sport .
in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly via advertising , sponsor@@ ing and big tournaments .
in three years , sales are expected to be 130 million .
against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the Bundes@@ liga , this is little .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ sport &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is no longer far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes the Del@@ o@@ itte Ad@@ vis@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many countries are already on the move .
big markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez participate in the US team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher , Hollywood actor , inv@@ ests in Uni@@ kr@@ n .
a lot is happening in Europe as well .
in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport was introduced as an instruc@@ tional subject , says F@@ rob@@ ber .
in the Netherlands and in France , the Bundes@@ liga clubs according to D@@ utt are now obliged to set up an e @-@ sport department .
&quot; Germany is lag@@ ging behind in Europe , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B CEO R@@ ött@@ ger .
only in nostal@@ gia to decay , and to glori@@ fy the ancient times is no longer enough today .
the aim is to preserve the tradition of the association , but at the same time alig@@ ning the company with the modern market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we live in a digi@@ ti@@ zed world , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t keep in mind that everything stays the same with football as it always was . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter convic@@ ted of the texts that Con@@ rad Roy ple@@ ad for suicide
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her boy@@ friend through texts and calls to commit suicide .
Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years have been exposed to prob@@ ation .
Car@@ ter was convic@@ ted in June because of negli@@ gent killing of Con@@ rad Roy who took his life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is un@@ comfor@@ ting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Car@@ ter was allowed to stay free until his appointment .
she had been confronted with a maximum sentence of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a psychological illness .
dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , Car@@ ter stood with tears in her eyes , with folded hands and downward bent eyes when she was convic@@ ted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your actions have killed Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she finished his life to make her own better .
she has no responsibility , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has not shown any re@@ mor@@ se . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ter &apos;s lawyer said it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful circum@@ stance that they depl@@ ore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said he did not find that their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; age or maturity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or even their mental illness have a significant influence on their actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a prosec@@ utor read a statement by Roy &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy who said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no day at which I do not take the loss of my beloved son . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I want him to be proud of me and how I am dealing with everything . I try to be there for his sisters in spite of all my pain that we will carry for eternity for his sisters . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ ys &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , stated that she &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pursu@@ es &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that she would never take part in her brother &apos;s wedding or would be a a@@ unt for his children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s no longer the only person I &apos;ve been with since I was born , is a pain I &apos;ll always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent since there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide .
Car@@ ter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead of a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a vehicle in 2014 .
the case drew national attention after Car@@ ters revealed text messages that she encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; hang up , hop from a building , get up yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; she said in several news that she sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family .
in the moments before his suicide she wrote : &quot; you must do it , Con@@ rad &quot; and &quot; Every@@ thing you need to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said Car@@ ter &apos;s attention was sought by Roy &apos;s death and ordered that she should benefit by any press .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
among the few who defended Car@@ ter was Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was convic@@ ted in 2007 for murder of her British fellow @-@ mate in Italy before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter deserves compassion and help , not prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ mer : learning from the new Mini @-@ L@@ ah@@ m of FC Bayern
that Joshua Kim@@ i was allowed to run as captain in the Audi Cup is no coinci@@ dence .
the FC Bayern will give the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner a big season - extra motivation doesn &apos;t hurt there .
something was different on his place in the cabin , that was Joshua Kim@@ me immediately , even though the extra piece of clothing was very , very small .
but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , of course , no Philipp L@@ ah@@ m and no Manuel Neu@@ er had to be seen , he simply placed himself on his arm .
&quot; the trainer has not announced it , &quot; said the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner afterwards , after his first assignment as Bavaria &apos;s captain .
good , the entry could have run better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but Kim@@ i could interpret the sign of the coach .
not the eight @-@ year old Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal was chosen as a player in the C @-@ el@@ f from youth players , de@@ but@@ ants and even retired professionals , but he .
sugar is best distributed to those with a lot of herbs that you want to keep in a good mood .
so those who were chosen to take the heritage of L@@ ah@@ m can only use a little extra motivation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kim@@ i confirmed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old fli@@ ck@@ ered over the field as a Mini @-@ L@@ ah@@ m .
to the right back , that is his position , the white band@@ age at the arm did the rest .
and in general , Kim@@ i worked in this initial formation like the one who can take the ru@@ dder in his hand .
he gave instructions , tried to direct the un@@ coordinated tro@@ upe .
he had a look for the whole while many others were busy with himself .
Vi@@ dal to over@@ play his missing fitness ( worked hard ) ; Ren@@ ato Soft went out to tie up the performance of the Asia journey , and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le did not fall down neg@@ atively in their first appearance in the Bayern @-@ Tri@@ k@@ ot .
after all , it worked out quite well .
in addition to Kim@@ ber@@ ich , Ru@@ dy was running over against the defense , both of them acted confi@@ dently .
the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli storm was often difficult , and in addition he tried a few times in the building of the game .
his colleague Ru@@ dy admitted that the outcome was &quot; not as we hoped it would be . &quot;
but he too showed a decent performance in the debut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; mod@@ al shift , tempo change : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was also fet@@ ched for this style . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as un@@ usually this Bavaria world is still for the new entran@@ ces , one saw afterwards the game .
Ru@@ dy , for example , gave in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs not one or two , but definitely six or seven interviews .
Kim@@ mer said good@@ bye to his new fellow players after a few cris@@ p statements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there he heard an interesting sentence from Sü@@ ander : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is going on here I have already noticed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Bavaria you just have to win every game . &quot;
at least he does not have to teach the new .
Al@@ aba motiv@@ ates Ö@@ FB @-@ ladies
David Al@@ aba believes in the success of our O@@ FB @-@ ladies
Austria &apos;s most well @-@ known foot@@ ball@@ ers reported on Twitter shortly before the game and wanted the Ö@@ FB @-@ ladies all the best .
the Bavaria @-@ legi@@ on@@ aire is quasi a club @-@ member of Ö@@ FB @-@ Kapit@@ än@@ in Schn@@ a@@ der@@ beck and spark@@ les with our La@@ dies .
the T@@ we@@ et of the Austrian football player of the year and Champions League winner was supposed to be a special motivation .
the famous Bav@@ arians may well need our ladies .
company satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Minister : economy lo@@ oms wis@@ ps speed
it often turned out irre@@ conc@@ il@@ ably the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) still Minister of Economy of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
this is evident after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak to T V demand of a change in economic policy - and at the same time t@@ ad@@ tise the old minist@@ erial segment .
Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Trier Companies ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; Wis@@ sing ass@@ esses the wishes of the economy that Lem@@ ke has all blocked . &quot;
Nat@@ us sees the largest turn@@ around in infrastructure policy : the gap of the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the priority list of the country .
this year the Ministry hopes for a planning process , until 2021 the construction law is expected to stand .
a role in the plans of the country is also played by the West circum@@ vention of Trier , which stands in the urgent need of the federal road plan .
the goal is to put the circuit into operation in December 2020 , says the Ministry spokes@@ woman Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
Nat@@ us sees this as a sign to support regional , but internationally competing companies .
the Chamber of Industry and Commerce ( I@@ HK ) Trier is striving , as suggested by Wis@@ sing , a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate label with wine in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports that have been sag@@ ging for ten years .
furthermore , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to found their own company , pra@@ ises the Chamber of Commerce .
the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Trier sees an additional incentive for young apprenti@@ ces in the new Master Bonus , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
a premium of 1000 Euro is fores@@ een for the pass exam and 2500 Euro if graduates make themselves independent within ten years of the Master &apos;s degree .
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
the planned road construction is quick facts to create , but at the same time it is missing the necessary personnel , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , chief executive of the Chamber of Commerce of Trier .
until now , only 29 jobs have been occupied by 56 new engineers who want to set up Wis@@ sing at the regional company mobility .
the Chamber of Commerce calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices .
Christian Bal@@ d@@ on &apos;s CD@@ U , Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf , points to calculations of the Court of Audi@@ tors , the country has invested more than 20 million euros in the preservation of country roads in 2017 and 2018 .
Frank Nat@@ us also expects a concept of the country to address the shortage of skilled workers in the region .
the current broad@@ band expansion in the country is also so@@ ber@@ ing .
in 2016 , regional companies had assessed the grid supply in an I@@ HK survey only with the score 3.4 .
they compl@@ ained about stagn@@ ant internet connections and out@@ breaks .
former Minister for Economic Affairs , E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke , is currently out of politics and still sits on the supervisory board of the wind turbine Pro Wind .
the Green Group left Lem@@ ke in April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe , where she cleared the field after four months because of in@@ consist@@ encies .
Audi aims to change 85@@ 0,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter reaction
one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would offer the software to update in more than 35@@ 0,000 vehicles .
the BMW Chairman said the company believes that &quot; there are more intelligent options than restrictions , &quot; thus referring to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is located - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles .
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the enterprises as call@@ backs .
European automotive manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
but nitrogen oxi@@ des that em@@ it diesel engines are considered carcin@@ o@@ gens and may cause asthma .
the costs for car manufacturers to install equipment for neutr@@ alization of exhaust gases that are ej@@ ected from diesel vehicles are also increasing , making it difficult to keep cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of ou@@ ting the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing signs of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called shut@@ ters , which could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but in normal driving conditions .
in the United States , several Volkswagen employees were indic@@ ted and others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former Head of Ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ ch@@ eo Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is Italian and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be brought to court in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen , after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circum@@ vent the emissions regulations in Europe , and a request focused on the United States was expanded .
the involvement of Audi in the study could be difficult for Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes a dispro@@ portion@@ ately high degree to Volkswagen &apos;s profit .

Mor@@ dil@@ los N@@ oll @-@ bun@@ ni@@ es and the laughter against the suffering
Mor@@ di@@ llo was at times one of the most publi@@ ci@@ zed carto@@ on sket@@ ches , the bun@@ ni@@ es of his characters are his trademark .
even with 85 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an still works and works on a film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his message : laugh , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist , he proposed himself as a sig@@ nat@@ ory for greeting cards - which frustr@@ ated him .
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he once said .
at the end of the 1960s , after stops in Lima , New York and Paris , he made his breakthrough : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match &quot; and then also in the &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China , Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
again and again the artist was inspired by cities .
large , round Mor@@ di@@ llo pieces cav@@ ort in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning , according to his own information , he still sits at the drawing table , works almost ten hours daily .
on cal@@ endar@@ s , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , stu@@ ffed animals and clo@@ cks , his dro@@ ll figures continue to be widely distributed worldwide .
he has been working on a carto@@ on and a TV show with his characters for six years .
the protagon@@ ist in the movie &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los most popular animal in his drawings - which has a thousand foot@@ er as a counter@@ part .
for the first time , his figures in the 3D film will be projected onto the cinema wall in 2019 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what to say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the script is not written by him .
that is why he relies more on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced without words .
la@@ ven@@ der threatened by climate change
it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .
the la@@ ven@@ der is dec@@ lining due to insect @-@ remin@@ ding conditions and insect @-@ borne insects , which causes scientists and farmers trying to find solutions , causing great head@@ aches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the C@@ RI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M agricultural research institute in Provence , said : &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant in the past years has exposed the effects of climate change , which in the spring brought much less rain and much more in the fall .
this has effects on the li@@ fes@@ pan of la@@ ven@@ der .
there is also a small ci@@ ch@@ ade , a micro @-@ bacter@@ ium that transm@@ its the d@@ warf ci@@ ca@@ des , and in very dry weather there are many of it . &quot;
and there &apos;s a lot in the game .
la@@ ven@@ der oil not only attracts tourists , it is also very popular for perf@@ ume and cosmetics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of having very long plants with a large number of flowers , we have under@@ developed smaller , under@@ developed and either lacking or weakened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot;
the solutions that are considered include improved water distribution and evap@@ oration of the soil , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective blend of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to d@@ rought .

the assass@@ ination of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat in Mexico
the employees of the weekly newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce usually meet Wedn@@ es@@ days to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and inc@@ ess@@ ant drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
they were told that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ level journalists discuss what feels more secure : they are supposed to bring their children into the office , which were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades in 2009 , or leave them at home .
security experts have written three words on a plaque on the front of the room : opponents , Neut@@ ral , Al@@ lies .
they ask the repor@@ ters to propose names for each column - no evidence is needed , percep@@ tions and gut feelings suff@@ ice .
there are drug s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of standing on the government &apos;s pay@@ roll or cart@@ els , a catalogue of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no break from violence , and while the bodies accum@@ ulate in the whole country , more and more journalists are there : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to entered his office in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are subject to attacks and threats under federal protection and until now there have been at least seven deaths in seven countries this year .
among the latter are their editors and their inspiration from Ri@@ odo@@ ce , co @-@ founder J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs .
his absence is felt deep , although his presence is everywhere - a big photo of Val@@ dez presenting his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice . &quot; two repor@@ ters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez , wear T @-@ shirts showing his smiling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the repor@@ ters discuss about their shared topics , the trauma , their night@@ mar@@ es , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although a Special At@@ tor@@ ney Office was established in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists , it has only initiated two criminal proceedings , according to the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists .
as with most thousands of mur@@ ders , which are associated with drug traffi@@ cking and organised crime , the kill@@ ers of journalists are rarely brought to trial .
at Ri@@ odo@@ ce they still ins@@ ist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a although they are in@@ con@@ sol@@ able and although the terrain is now even more tra@@ it@@ eful .
without information on the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting to discuss safety has little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the why , we stum@@ ble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the capital of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
he only managed to drive a few blocks before his red Toyota Cor@@ oll@@ a was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times he was shot on him , presumably because of the name of the newspaper - the &quot; twel@@ fth river . &quot;
the sho@@ oter ro@@ de away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two grown @-@ up children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly around in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
but on the subject of Val@@ dez , there is practically nothing but silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest in January and ex@@ tradition to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country since ri@@ val@@ ing fac@@ tions are fighting to fill the vacuum .
it does not matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a one or more people are shot on the street every day or that the cemetery is full of decorated , two @-@ story m@@ aus@@ ole@@ ums for drug kings that are larger than many houses for the living .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; peace &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and trade routes in the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , was broken with the blame that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions have contributed to the murder .
first of all there was the publication of an interview with Damascus Lop@@ ez , one of the leaders of one of the rival cart@@ el frac@@ tions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons .
this publication may have anno@@ yed the sons , gu@@ essed aisle members purchased every copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second mistake was not to force Val@@ dez to leave the country for his own security following the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper , which had published the same story .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced repor@@ ter for nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 when he joined with five colleagues to set up Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollar hol@@ dings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to run journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the drug @-@ tox@@ in problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
over time , the newspaper has earned a reputation because of cour@@ a@@ geous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased .
repor@@ ters liked to be able to publish hard @-@ fitting investigations without fear of cens@@ orship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dar@@ ed to treat .
eight years after the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for her reporting in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the International Press Freedom Award for the protection of journalists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drug history , wherever it led .
he willingly admitted he was afraid .
&quot; I want to continue living , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J Award .
&quot; &quot; &quot; drugs trade in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a way of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to take over the task that suits you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what have you done in the face of so many dead ... why didn &apos;t you tell us what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ odo@@ ce team missed Val@@ dez , the fun bird that was cur@@ sing like a do@@ ck@@ worker , a friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sit there at the same table .
now they ask , Was His love for routine destruction ?
his death also forced them to question their own ass@@ umptions about how they can best do their job and stay alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like it when you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their secret run@@ ways and run@@ ways &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even in the best times , a high level of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation .
trust his own inst@@ inc@@ ts .
if it sm@@ ells wrong , stay away from it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the anger is , the editor of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smell is a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing with J@@ avier is happening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a , as not as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a po@@ ison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home .
the landscape is changing constantly .
in the space where the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce met for safety training , no mobile phones suddenly were allowed . days earlier , it became known that sp@@ y@@ ware , which is exclusively sold to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two polic@@ emen tried shelter from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a mid @-@ size district of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
half in the joke , some of the repor@@ ters asked if these officers were among the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen , whom the governor was not trust@@ worthy .
it is months since the repor@@ ters went to the mountain landscape , where drug gangs are de facto under control .
for the issue of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ce has fu@@ cked on three main stories .
there was the assass@@ ination of the brother of the former famous speaker Juli@@ o C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an expos@@ é about the state expendi@@ tures concentrated on the governor &apos;s home town .
and there was a group located in one of the most expensive restaurants in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an , a block away from the office of the prosec@@ utor .
there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or how it happened , so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite local drug dealer and government .
a repor@@ ter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian who ruled the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which ruled almost the whole century all the political levels .
recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ cali@@ ber cases of corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the repor@@ ter to write about previous events in this restaurant , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military attack .
only a few months earlier , readers of Val@@ dez had looked at Val@@ dez &apos;s column as the best informed source of ab@@ duction .
&quot; earlier we had known what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; because of his slender body stat@@ ure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Val@@ dez &apos;s office became a storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers that prot@@ esting against the kill@@ ings of journalists , because the employees have become something they themselves never expected : activists in the name of the press .
repor@@ ter Mi@@ ri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez took a few signs and went to a demonstration next morning for another journalist to the office of the prosec@@ utor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body has been discovered and officials say based on DNA testing that it is his .
journalists have become lou@@ der all over the country by writing down on pav@@ ements and buildings in organized protests by &quot; S@@ OS Press . &quot;
on this day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the case of Val@@ dez .
during a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , R@@ ami@@ rez accused the authorities of sp@@ ying journalists and letting them kill because they have said the truth .
she has asked since then that she is again divided by the government , because she is worried that her anger has viol@@ ated her objec@@ tivity .
Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were &quot; surrounded &quot; by organised crime , the government officials involved and an indiffer@@ ent society .
in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that repor@@ ters are not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the orders of politicians and security forces who were hiding under a blanket with organised crime .
last year , the media group &quot; Ar@@ ticul@@ o 19 &quot; assigned more than half of the attacks to journalists of police and civil servants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you die in Mexico because they want you to keep your mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said R@@ ami@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the mur@@ ders have a deter@@ rent effect .
no one for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her body was found along with a note signed by Z@@ et@@ as @-@ Kartell , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Here I am because of my reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a computer keyboard and headphones lay next to their separate head .
some branches have chosen to close as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assass@@ ination of the correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the murder of her director in 2004 .
in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publi@@ ci@@ zed the drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the title page titled &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists fled from their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and look for dangers .
and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as apparently the photographer Ru@@ ben E@@ spin@@ osa , who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who stay behind and continue work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , ad@@ mits that drug traffi@@ cking frigh@@ tens him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico goes to hell , and that &apos;s why I became a repor@@ ter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at midnight the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk in front of the office and d@@ rank beer when all their phones began to h@@ um .
a series of sho@@ ot@@ ings with ri@@ vals and security forces near the Maz@@ at@@ lan bath@@ house had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war continued to escal@@ ate as promised by a series of cart@@ el messages in the region .
from the cur@@ b edge , they published the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce via mobile phone .
the title page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ ren how@@ ls close up - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a glance at the polic@@ emen who kept watch to see if they were ready .
if they were sc@@ ared at all , they did not show it .
under the massive portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible to all Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his tracks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you just think of closing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if on the same day J@@ avier was assass@@ inated , the intern asked me to send her to the road . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to avoid his enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue , al@@ beit a frigh@@ tening one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible N@@ ash@@ or@@ ns of a Canadian mountain worker have been so well received that experts have described it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa der Din@@ osau@@ rier &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was so well received that they could even determine that his sli@@ pper@@ y skin was red@@ dish brown - and they said they had something of a &quot; troubled past . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report in the magazine &quot; Current Biology &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; described it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best @-@ preserved din@@ osau@@ r ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ r copies in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fossil is a newly discovered species of no@@ od@@ les that lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
his incredibly well preserved state has ba@@ ff@@ led researchers who describe it as &quot; really remarkable . &quot;
according to National Ge@@ ographic reports , the her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es are the best preserved fossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk on March 21 , 2011 at the S@@ unc@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada .
he hit something that seemed out of the surrounding rock out of place , and decided to look more closely .
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years trying to uncover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) of heavy petro@@ gly@@ phs .
after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you only b@@ link a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it slept , &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum , where the creature is to be seen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ r copies - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the Din@@ osau@@ riere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
researchers have found that this her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous , although covered with a arm@@ or and resembles a changing tank , probably threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs .
the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to hide from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique known as counter@@ f@@ ading , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed us to get better acquainted with his surroundings and to avoid his enemies , say experts , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million @-@ year @-@ old creature from the family of the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier has made head@@ lines in May and is now to be seen at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and named Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli following the museum technician Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team who has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours to uncover it carefully .
the astonishing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and arm@@ our over his body .
they discovered the sh@@ ading , a widespread defense method in animal kingdom , which means that the top of the creature was dark@@ er than its under@@ side .
although the sh@@ ading is common , the results are surprising , as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta far exceeds that of today living animals .
it points to the din@@ osau@@ rs being hun@@ ted by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs that evolution fav@@ ored the conce@@ al@@ ment of confrontation as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals that use the sh@@ ading - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or belt animals - are much smaller and vulnerable than loo@@ t , which sign@@ alizes that this No@@ dos@@ cope was exposed to a real struggle for survival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ or behaviour on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ r pre@@ dat@@ ors have to have been the chal@@ k time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
scientists continue to study the animal on critics concerning his life , including his con@@ served intestinal content to find out what it has eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , got into a river and was driven out into the sea , where he sank back to the bottom of the sea .
at that time , Alber@@ ta was as warm as Sou@@ fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans are likely far far@@ ther inland than they are today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this noise carrier is really remarkable , because it is completely covered with preserved sc@@ aly skin , but remains intact in three dimensions and maintains the original shape of the animal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that the animal looks almost the same today as in the early chal@@ k time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you don &apos;t need to use a lot of imagination to re@@ construct it . if you just ke@@ el a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it is sleeping . &quot;
the period was a time when huge thermal di@@ odes , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs standing on two legs crossed the earth .
although the king of them , the Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Re@@ x , lived millions of years to Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his terri@@ fying foref@@ athers .
this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 11.@@ 5 m ) long , six ton heavy monster .
the scientists , whose latest findings are published in Current Biology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta was sin@@ king after death in the sea and m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk on 21 March 2011 at the S@@ unc@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada .
according to the museum , it is the world &apos;s best @-@ preserved din@@ osau@@ r , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from mu@@ zzle to hip .
the creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and have weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .

the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es were swe@@ pt through the western Canada until a floo@@ ded river floo@@ ded it into the open sea .
but the water @-@ ref@@ und@@ ment of the din@@ osau@@ r preserved its arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin of the house still cover b@@ ump@@ y ar@@ mor@@ ed plates along the din@@ osau@@ r .
as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of preservation is as &apos; rare as a win in the lot@@ tery .
the more I approach it , the more conf@@ using it becomes .
pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y ar@@ mor@@ ed plates carrying the skull of the animal .

in the thunder@@ storm : mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A8 : many injured
severe accident on Thursday evening on the A8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
there are numerous wounded , miles of traffic jams and G@@ aff@@ er .
on the highway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A8 ) around 20 people were injured in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on the late th@@ urs@@ day afternoon .
according to the first data of the police , at 17.00 o &apos;clock between the connecting places Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm close to 30 vehicles , among them probably also trucks , crashed .
at first there were no indications of the exact number of injured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a matter of light to moderate injuries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large array of rescue vehicles was at the scene of the accident .
the A8 was completely closed towards Munich .
in the direction of Munich , a round trip of about ten kilometres was formed .
as reported by an A@@ Z repor@@ ter , there occurred also on the return track to massive obstruc@@ tions - by numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade noted the characteristics of the vehicle handle@@ bars , which now have to be reck@@ oned with sensitive pen@@ alties .
shortly after 6 : 45 pm a second accident occurred on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a collision between a car transpor@@ ter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the road to the accident spot .
Deutsche Bahn : group tests &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced once : nothing escap@@ es in the train and sleeps .
or one is deep@@ ened into his work and has just a brilliant mind .
and then : mu@@ ff@@ led .
comes the conductor and w@@ akes you sof@@ tly or tears off the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
ticket inspection .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are soon over .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the free ticket inspection .
you simply confirm by mobile phone that you take your seat and use it to vali@@ date the ticket .
currently , a test operation is running on two routes .
&quot; if the offer comes , we extend it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is expected to be available at many further distance routes in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a railway speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls the railway ticket de@@ valuation without any conductor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be able to use them , however , some requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to book an online ticket - what already most passengers do anyway .
it also has to be bought by the app of the railway , the DB navig@@ ator , which is anyway the most convenient type of ticket booking .
and last but not least , you need a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works like this : one climb@@ s into the train , calls his ticket to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the test customer then appears a button for electronic de@@ valuation .
the train atten@@ d@@ ants receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat Y .
when the driver arrives at the ticket inspection in place Y , he knows that there is a passenger with a pre @-@ paid online ticket .
so you can continue to sleep , continue working , keep silent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should use the passengers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if you want to travel relaxed without ticket inspection by our train atten@@ dant , you simply check in the DB Navigator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this enables passengers to person@@ alize their travel time on the train , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , marketing management board of DB correspondence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who often ride a train knows that in addition to delays and missed trains , ticket controls are one of the biggest nu@@ is@@ ances .
because of@@ ten@@ times you don &apos;t have all the documents you need for the de@@ valuation of online tickets .
either the credit card or the ID card or otherwise a document you have to show .
the result is endless discussions between train atten@@ dant and passenger , which leads to bad mood in the compartment or large area and delays in controlling your own tickets and takes the Schaff@@ ner at the end time to take care of other concerns .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and this also only at the ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further train numbers on the same route are not yet un@@ locked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 9 August 2014 Britt@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was shaken to its core .
only one day after she arrived in New York City , the apartment in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment they rented and sc@@ rolling through Facebook on their phone .
she stum@@ bled over a post from someone from the High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just killed a 18 @-@ year old child and it is still on the road , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused as nobody else posted the information on her feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was continually res@@ cu@@ ed on her tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper from St. Louis area was twe@@ aking the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed , black 18 year old who was killed by a white police officer in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo .
he posted a picture of Brown &apos;s lifel@@ ess body that was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she left her cell phone in order to return to T@@ we@@ ets on the Can@@ field @-@ Drive later in the evening .
there were photos of the police band and people scre@@ aming , and of a man who claimed to be Brown &apos;s father wearing a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on &apos;s police killed just my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she observed a live feed where a polic@@ eman stood in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman said his ri@@ f@@ le and cried , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to kill you ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is not usual , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l remembered her statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the type of murder we have gotten used to and that we can be typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that moment , I felt ch@@ ills .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was angry and wept . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after the landing at 23 o &apos;clock she fet@@ ched her six @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would drive to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning .
what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the subject of a new documentary , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in the cin@@ emas from the 11th .
it is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance , which consists of the perspective of the people living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers .
when Fer@@ rel@@ l came to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on with her daughter , who carried a flower @-@ dress and a matching crown , the two spoke a conversation that they had &quot; over the black experience and the black state countless times before this morning . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I taught you when black people must fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &apos;re going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I couldn &apos;t take her with me , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l said later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what has happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must know and see it and be raised therein .
it must be well developed not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution , and what we have to do to free ourselves .
even if I have the luck to give her an experience , in which she personally does not experience bl@@ at@@ ant rac@@ ism , she is no different from the next black female child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel I would be doing a bad service to keep them away from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first stop when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on was on the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ charge of officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter were connected with a local business owner who made lunch .
they prepared bags and helped to pass them on to prot@@ esters .
slowly a new type of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rel@@ l .
&quot; my activ@@ ism totally changed after 9 August , &quot; she said , and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities .
&quot; I had no experience in organising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s all come . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
weeks later , Fer@@ rel@@ l met during an evening demonstration , Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the film &apos;s co @-@ directors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r wanted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; document &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one question asked Fer@@ rel@@ l : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story you can use ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this scep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often of wh@@ ites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the field known for his activ@@ ism around death stra@@ ct prisoners .
his engagement brought Fer@@ rel@@ l closer to the project , along with six other natives , the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ning &apos;s shooting .
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks or talks to us . we speak , &quot; Davis said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was the main thing for me as these people are represented , for so I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to focus on Ferr@@ ells &apos;s experience - to show that the movement &quot; is not a Messiah leader , but a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it proved to be the most obvious participant in the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , documents of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; show the surprising personal aspects of Ferr@@ ara &apos;s life as she loves and mar@@ ries her wife . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt naked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and for the human@@ ization of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Ferr@@ ells &apos;s history repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the broader Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three founders of the movement , who after the killing of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 have shaped the film &quot; Black@@ Li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identify themselves as gay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have borne the movement altogether , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; black gay women must bear the brun@@ t of everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement really is held up by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not an affir@@ mati@@ vely type of action &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which Fer@@ rel@@ l was chosen as the heart of the film because of her identity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she was the person shaking this energy , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is no accident , although it was at the front , because in a life at these cross@@ ings as a black , gay woman stands as much in the game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
in the meantime the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have disappeared long ago , but the ra@@ cial connections between the congregation and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rel@@ l is on guard for 2 ½ years due to the blocking of a highway at a demonstration .
she describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; a chaos . &quot;
nevertheless she cl@@ ings to a song and she feels committed to this memory since she went into F@@ erg@@ us@@ on three years ago .
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we must love and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; : TV readers discuss about bit gallery
the bit gallery moves people even though it hasn &apos;t been built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping centre on the south end of the pedestrian zone has been spl@@ itting the population in pro@@ pon@@ ents and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .
the theme is hardly any cold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some say to the bit gallery : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( An@@ ja Becker ) or &quot; That &apos;s really great &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; no man needs &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or simply : &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) .
while the pro@@ pon@@ ents build that a gallery attracts more customers to the city , the other businesses profit from it , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding .
in addition , the gallery is planned precisely on the premises on which the farmer &apos;s market hall stands , where 13 direct brands offer their products .
this will stop at the beginning of the construction work .
the gallery makers wish to integrate a market hall into the new building - for Bed@@ a @-@ Platz with possibility to sit outside .
Sim@@ one Room : &quot; we have been shopping for almost a week in the peasant market hall for many years .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the Land@@ wives time and again very gladly .
we also discovered the but@@ ch@@ ery for us .
we would like that even while and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities , there is that too .
especially the Klein@@ mark@@ thalle in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct marketing in a market hall in the gallery can be located , depends on the amount of the rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but this should not be low for the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; why shopping spre@@ es in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I find that unnecessary .
there &apos;s enough of that in our city .
you can see how many stores here are empty - some have been waiting for months and years .
but since there is not even a regular weekly market , it is all the more important that at least the Mark@@ thalle is maintained .
after all , the goods offered there are fresh , mostly offered directly from the producer and is also reasonably priced .
as you can see , stores in a shopping centre are rented only by larger companies , as the r@@ ents there are often un@@ sustainable for a retail@@ er .
too bad , special deals are almost no longer and what is left of it will probably disappear . &quot;
Wolf Fan@@ del : &quot; a shopping m@@ all with a Mark@@ thalle doesn &apos;t fit for me .
and the gallery does not fit into Bit@@ burg .
above all : where should the peasant market hall be held during the construction period ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery actually comes .
or does the gh@@ ost bit gallery actually manage to drive all business from Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; that won &apos;t work .
and there is no need for a shopping center that is empty .
in my view it would have been better to promote a real farmer &apos;s market , instead of this gallery .
but for a peasant market hall , thanks to the unbeliev@@ ably many - as I find - meaning@@ less construction projects in Bit@@ burg no longer place any space .
when the peasant market hall is destroyed , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits featuring Chelsea Mann@@ ing &apos;s DNA
in the middle of the space of the fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces are visible - white , black and brown , almost im@@ percep@@ tible - hanging on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ Tu@@ pf@@ ern and hair@@ cuts that were sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison , where the former secret service analy@@ st took a 35 @-@ year prison sentence after making public diplomatic noti@@ fications about the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition opened on August 2 is called A Bec@@ oming resem@@ b@@ lance ( A matching simil@@ arity ) .
she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline combined its expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a Trans@@ woman and a pioneering dissi@@ dent , whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office .
through algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA , which has been extracted from Mann@@ ing and created out of 30 portraits , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg shows a sharp , al@@ beit slightly intellectual comment , not only in the form of DNA data - the many ways it can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also created for identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born in Brad@@ ley Edward , but openly talked about identification as a woman since her pu@@ ber@@ ty , was convic@@ ted in 2013 for 20 charges , including six violations of the es@@ pion@@ age law , computer fraud and theft .
through the prison her picture was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ ined black @-@ and @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie in which Mann@@ ing sits invisi@@ bly on a driver &apos;s seat and wearing a plat@@ in@@ blonde wig - with which she was associated .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was just about the great success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
the artist produced portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts such as cigarette but@@ ts and ch@@ ewing gum using DNA from waste to produce a picture of how these people might look .
that was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg in a press review of the new exhibition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and she couldn &apos;t visit her and she couldn &apos;t be photograph@@ ed , so she got in contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her det@@ ained m@@ use were too un@@ equal , who changed several letters over the course of two years .
they even created one of Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o illustrated Com@@ ic &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images , &quot; which fores@@ aw a future in which the President Ch@@ ats Over@@ seas will convert judgment and would be able to see the exhibition in person .
that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was released to demand Mann@@ ing release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as , was a welcome type of happy encounter .
there is also now at the opening of the exhibition something deep and strong , as Donald Tr@@ ump performs a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against Trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to further infl@@ ame the rigid divisions that he should actually remedy .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked for the strange timing of all these things she said that &quot; things are going to happen for a certain reason . &quot;
in an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing stressed with her super@@ large signature ( the &quot; i &quot; in her family name is marked with a heart ) an end to &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , whose basis gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture have been . &quot;
on the opposite wall is their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ ler of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was hoping to show through the inclusion of the 200 characters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des according to the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist ) , as aston@@ ish@@ ingly similar , at least in a biological sense , we are all .
&quot; what people will hopefully take with it is that our gen@@ ome doesn &apos;t care who we are and how openly genetic data is for interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work from 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , is also visible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories so that &apos;s 30 of these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is stored in a separate room , is a page from the above @-@ mentioned com@@ ic @-@ nov@@ elle .
it shows Mann@@ ing how she emerges from the discipline of discipline of the United States like King Kong with a hands @-@ on phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they talk about your speech , they won . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so never stop your mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist who greeted us from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ um@@ ps when I talk about it . &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition personally - as it was anticipated in the com@@ ic book - but if it was to do it , it will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic simulations , which assemble themselves like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
this was also target @-@ oriented , like everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ ored ) , in which their genetic groups were written with pencil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg of the portraits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , like the movement that was also behind its liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor at the University of Nor@@ th@@ western and an employee of the University of Oxford for murder
a nationwide human race is underway for a professor at Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee of Oxford University who will be looked for as susp@@ ects after a man was stab@@ bed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with fatal injuries .
on Monday , W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) were issued arrest warran@@ ts due to their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton &apos;s H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as the acts of the Local Court of Cook County demonstrate .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several stit@@ ches .
a common warning system published by the Chicago Police Office states that the body was discovered on July 27 .
officials received a call , arrived at Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was declared dead at the point of action , and det@@ ec@@ tives investigate the stit@@ ches as murder while the police are actively seeking the two susp@@ ects , officials said .
since 2007 , La@@ them has been an associate professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at Nor@@ th@@ western University .
Alan K. Cu@@ b@@ ish , the vice president for university relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that they have now been in a state of absence and excluded from entering the campus of Nor@@ th@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal case investigated by the competent authorities , and the Nor@@ th@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cu@@ b@@ bage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of the University and Somer@@ ville College told in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the police in Britain and willing to help U.S. investig@@ ative authorities in any way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement added that War@@ ren &apos;s colleagues were shocked and want him to be present .
chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he insist@@ ed on the susp@@ ects to face the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have an idea of their place of stay , and our efforts to locate them reinforce , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building , who had just received a mysterious tip that said that something happened in apartment 10@@ 08 .
the police described the scene as very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27 .
security cameras confirm that they were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation to the residents : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the victim &apos;s background and expl@@ ores a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we will close the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mut@@ ko
Russian Deputy Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t last long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK anti @-@ dop@@ ing ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the WA@@ DA schedule was updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the PM featured the second part of WA@@ DA &apos;s schedule to comply with the code that describes the criteria for re @-@ en@@ forcing R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the organization &apos;s website .
according to Mut@@ ko , he does not include anything that could cause concern for Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything has been announced , everything is implemented . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , one of the criteria listed in the list reveals that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities must publicly accept the results of the examination approved by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren for alleged state @-@ supported dop@@ ing in Russian sports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in terms of the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation as our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has made a mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no government programmes and we will not admit something that does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mut@@ ko &apos;s words agreed with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v , head of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing Commission .
in conversation with Russian sales point r@@ sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v gave problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but added : &quot; we repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no one has proposed to accept this report un@@ condi@@ tionally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in November 2015 , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded from the implementation of dop@@ ing controls in Russia in the course of the dop@@ ing sc@@ andal .
however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK anti @-@ dop@@ ing ( U@@ K@@ AD ) .
after visiting the headquarters of the Moscow organization in July , WA@@ DA Director General Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli explained that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA moved &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be used again .

the start ups that will help your company do not become the next U@@ ber
A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure the luck with your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the surveys didn &apos;t work .
answers were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or - worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent .
and even if you promised anonym@@ ity , some workers did not trust the process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never consistency and objec@@ tivity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care company Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she called people from outside for help .
a new Human Resources start @-@ ups breed is growing in order to help companies find out how their employees feel .
by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee involvement , it enables companies to offer surveys , offer specific groups and demo@@ graphical groups , staff anonym@@ ity and complaints hot@@ lines , and in some cases , whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers allow to circum@@ vent the C Suite executives and turn directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; you now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit to track your health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement .
Er@@ ret@@ t said that she has a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years won with G@@ lin@@ t .
in addition to the Sn@@ ap surveys and surveys from specific teams , it provides a heat card of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which managers have low @-@ response results - so you can drill down why .
companies are coming to see that they have to stay at the top of the workplace culture , so that you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als since a former employee has published a blog post describing an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment where those who have spoken , were punished .
for start @-@ ups such as G@@ lin@@ t , this wish is a lu@@ cr@@ ative business possibility after an overview .
the global governance , regulation and compliance sector could have a value of more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion by 2020 , according to the &quot; Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments &quot; financial portal .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , who helps companies to prevent bad behaviour and identify , saw an increasing interest and activity beginning this year amid the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
Con@@ ver@@ cent has nearly 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
recently registered as a client .
as G@@ lin@@ t , Con@@ ver@@ cent will send you customized &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect sensitive answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas .
it also provides an anonymous SMS hot@@ line that allows employees to report bad behavior .
and when the main managing director is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court of public opinion has captured the regul@@ ators , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , founder and managing director of Con@@ ver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a company is found that treats its employees poorly or beha@@ ves un@@ eth@@ ically , it can experience costly consequences by consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee fluctu@@ ation and complaints , said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
Ru@@ by Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites , Con@@ ver@@ cent has used for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters .
earlier if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or e @-@ mail for the company headquarters , submit formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .
it was often a intim@@ id@@ ation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by Tu@@ es@@ days General Coun@@ sel who said there was no good way to track down the complaints of staff .
now , as the company Con@@ ver@@ cent uses , problems that were previously hidden by executives who were sitting in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair practice , can be identified and addressed more quickly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can get closer to this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view of working with employment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who heads the Risk Management Group of Ru@@ by Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders against employment disputes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies started to take ethics , values and employee engagement in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed because of ethical violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social media came to their right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry on @-@ line . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both G@@ lin@@ t and Con@@ ver@@ cent offer your software as a service , and burden the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance to find the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start @-@ ups .
Con@@ ver@@ cent received $ 10 million for funding in February of companies such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , with which the total capital was raised to $ 47 million .
gl@@ itz@@ ers secured $ 10 million in November of B@@ ess@@ emer &apos;s Venture Partners and brought his entire funding to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising given the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing research complex that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more from their jobs than before .
in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only applications .
the employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to be in a company , feel that their voices heard , and that the work you do is worth it , then they feel more committed to making this business successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which uses both Con@@ ver@@ cent and G@@ lin@@ t .
investors reach yields if their portfolio companies run well . businesses run well when employees are committed and engaged .
if the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data on employee engagement in accordance with the experts of workplace culture is important .
but the data is useless if the administrator of a company does not take action .
in fact , when a company asks employees for your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way .
and if the changes are not fast enough or not at all , this can cause dis@@ appointments and demo@@ tiv@@ ate employees .
&quot; if you ask for 4000 suggestions , you have to be ready to have 4.000 talks , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies that have left too much on collecting data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you don &apos;t follow people ask yourself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about it ?
and if you don &apos;t care why , why should I ? &quot;
Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now conduc@@ ts monthly associate surveys , was able to initiate measures on the same day if a problem is reported about G@@ lin@@ t , Er@@ ret@@ t .
and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , it was able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems .
at Ru@@ by Tuesday , the company always gets new insights into the employees , and it hopes that in the long run , this leads to a better bonding of employees in a sector that is known for high turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose the people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if you lose customers , then you will lose companies .
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the break
it is about 23 o &apos;clock when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA foot@@ ball@@ ers conver@@ se on one side of the new practice fields of the team on campus .
some have pulled out their tri@@ cot shells and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team this idle time is a lunch break .
players who are en@@ rolled in the summer courses will return to their final ex@@ ams after the three hour exercise before returning to the Wasser@@ man Football Center the next morning at 6 : 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real treadmill for the guys the next three days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before Monday to Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the load of the players , and it actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore the first three sessions of U@@ C@@ LA started at 7 : 15 p.m. in order to meet the already packed schedule of the players .
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bru@@ ins postpon@@ ed the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as performed six game @-@ times in West@@ wood practical exercises .
they are supposed to hold 18 exercises over the course of August . 20 before the start of formal game preparations for their pr@@ el@@ ude to Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he supports N@@ CA@@ A &apos;s rule change even if they add another point to the multi @-@ busy routes of the players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous strain on them three or four days , and it &apos;s very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they simply pushed it through , they plac@@ ate themselves , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will be really great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U@@ C@@ LA will finish its practices once the camp is finished , which in view of the clear lines of its fields from an adjacent car park and adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the upper class , which has already been thrown with foot balls , which has a protective net behind a gate @-@ post , will not be an easy task .
players should occupy the hotel this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there might be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem and it is not far fet@@ ched to think that people are renting a room there , and then set up there to record an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the video tape of an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
that &apos;s why I don &apos;t worry too much .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts review in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles to third parties with counter@@ f@@ eit detection and then show their results under the original contribution , the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday said . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called fake news .
the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to identify possible counter@@ f@@ eit detection and to send them to fac@@ tual reviews that may display results from the original article .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many of which believe that they also influenced the US presidential election in 2016 .
the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , while the French voters were floo@@ ded with false stories in the run @-@ up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany supports a plan that social media networks should be punished if they fail to quickly recti@@ fy hat@@ eful post@@ ings as before the elections there in September .
on Thursday , Facebook spoke in a separate statement in German that a test of the new facts test will be launched in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; next to the knowledge which stories are challenged by third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sara S@@ u , product manager for Facebook messages in a blog . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; related articles &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and work on other changes to its news feed to reduce false messages . &quot; &quot; &quot;
creating a novel novel : a castle in the history of England
in his recent past the little Scot@@ ney castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margar@@ et T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970 &apos;s and 1980 &apos;s .
but Scot@@ ney has spent 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from his cozy seat at the River Valley in K@@ ent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a mop@@ ha@@ ired Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I find it so nice to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says with a melanch@@ oly voice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand . &quot;
&quot; a Castle in England &quot; sp@@ ans the period from the Middle Ages to the Age of Edward and documents the families living in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Ste@@ ie@@ wi@@ cz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des , which is based on an archive : he wrote &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; in 2014 , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found un@@ expect@@ edly emotional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only re@@ acted to the thumb print on the side of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700 &apos;s who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is its thumb print ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
and letters always smell of smoke , because at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if it were himself .
Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is so beaten with old papers that he was supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have over@@ rated my welcome p@@ its a bit &quot; ) seems to be all too beautiful to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Victori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle , viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted hy@@ ena pots on the walls and the bottles that spent centuries in the dit@@ ch .
he walked through the grounds and the ruins of the old castle , and spoke with landsc@@ aping , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
then , at night he d@@ rank &quot; Whis@@ key and began to write . &quot;
the intimate story of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown since the National Trust was only granted full access until 2006 , when the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rho@@ des interven@@ ed a decade later , the employees just started to take care of the archive that he described as &quot; hundreds of years in which aristoc@@ rats said &quot; Oh , cast it down on the attic . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the era of English Empire , maps that represent who possessed something : &quot; one could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch fighting the two families .
guys , let everything go their way ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive on a broader base into English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle in order to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record of a tur@@ mo@@ il that occurred in 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book titled &apos; Kni@@ gh@@ tly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , Rho@@ des says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the peasant rising began in this area and I thought that an insurrection was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the two are inter@@ connected ? &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which nar@@ rates the history of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ ers , which the Dar@@ rel@@ l family hid for seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler &apos; , in which the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l is portra@@ yed from the 18th century , which staged his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos;s favourite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gent@@ lemen seemed quite car@@ eless , always making debts and spending money on things they couldn &apos;t afford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l @-@ men solved their debt crisis by mar@@ rying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to promote er@@ binnen . &quot;
after the end of his essay in the castle Rho@@ des is searching for other unique write experiences
he has spent a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a com@@ ic novel about E@@ lä@@ mä@@ ki , the site of a san@@ atorium of the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ laimed by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to deal with the dam@@ ned life again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the un@@ v@@ eiling of the 301 @-@ year old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f launched its campaign for the launch of a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) on Friday .
until Thursday , mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team led by Nelson Ar@@ tz want to keep the logo and the slogan at home .
at the end of August , it should be the highlight of the campaign a celebration on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too nice for us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the makers of the campaign have been on the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dorf chapel since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not really think that ( of course ! ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they write on their yesterday released web site . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but we use this measure to attract your attention .
and to make it clear that things are better than it seems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; basically , we are firmly convinced that as a Bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer citizen , we are very well aware of the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the action is more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to form@@ ulate an all @-@ embra@@ cing promise , one that gives the city an unmistak@@ able unique selling point . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , she stands in competition with other commun@@ es .
the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f will cost the new umbrella brand and the campaign for an average five @-@ digit amount .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
every year at the beginning of August in Ankara , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) deliber@@ ates on pen@@ sion@@ ings and promotions in officer cor@@ ps .
this week too .
at first glance , a normal process .
but nothing is routine for Turkish armed forces one year after the coup attempt .
the meeting did not take place in the building of the General Staff , as before , but in the pres@@ idency of the Prime Minister .
under the pres@@ idency of the head of government , the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Minister of Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs participated in the discussions .
as a result , the civilians in the Y@@ AS were in excess .
the government is attrac@@ ting the re@@ ins in the military .
the Chief of Staff , Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar , remains in office , but the officers of the army , the Air Force , and the Navy were dismissed .
since the coup failed , head of state Erdo@@ gan 169 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als were fired .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged connections to the movement of the Ex@@ ile Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which Erdo@@ gan sees as a wi@@ re@@ pul@@ ler of the coup attempt .
against 4@@ 86 people allegedly involved in the coup attempt , Ankara has been negotiating in Ankara since this week .
already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan had described the coup attempt as &quot; God &apos;s present , &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to &quot; completely clean the armed forces . &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really have the army under control ?
at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article with the title &quot; un@@ e@@ as@@ iness in the military headquarters . &quot;
in the general staff there are concerns about the increasing &quot; Islam@@ isation &quot; of the army , which , among other things , mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the lifting of the ban on cloth for soldiers , wrote the newspaper .
in any case , large @-@ scale incorpor@@ ation in the army and the security forces continues .
in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan was fired by a decree of 7@@ 3@@ 95 govern@@ ors , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
it seemed that Erdo@@ gan had t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als used to be formerly the actual masters of the country .
three times they ruled on their role as custo@@ dians of the world@@ ly state order .
after his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan pushed back the power of the military step by step , not least by calling on the reform requirements of the European Union .
former officers say Erdo@@ gan is target@@ ing Islam@@ isation of the armed forces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a named officer who sought asylum from persecution abroad after the attempted put@@ sch , warned the Turkish army in a few years &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and sal@@ a@@ fi@@ sts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if this is true , such a development could not leave NATO cold .
in any case , after the pur@@ ges , there is doubt about the readiness to be deployed by the Turkish army .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the leadership structures and operational capabilities are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weakened &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; say NATO diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Tr@@ ump , cited by the media .
it envis@@ ages lowering the legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules on obtaining vis@@ as for temporary work permits and restrictions for family @-@ oriented visa .
the new rules are proposed by the Republi@@ cans and supported by the President .
the draft law shall be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers and will do this by changing the way citizens from other countries are spending green cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump , cited by the American media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ministry wants to repair track for race car shuttle
over and over again , over the past few months , the future of racing sh@@ utt@@ les has been cont@@ ested - now it should go quite fast .
before the end of the year , it is said to be built on the di@@ lap@@ id@@ ated track on which the tourist railway goes .
in order to ensure the long @-@ term survival of the race car park , construction work on the route will start in this year according to the Ministry of Transport .
&quot; with the decision to further order and rehabil@@ itate the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country is committed to this especially for tourism , &quot; explained Secretary of State Klaus Pun@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt .
the cost of the repair of the circuit was estimated at approximately 2.5 million euros .
of this sum , the country over@@ took 75 percent .
the contract , on which the shuttle is to be ordered from the country in the future , is currently finally approved , declared expi@@ ation .
the Ministry and the Süd@@ th@@ ür@@ ingen railway as operators are already in agreement on the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this , the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expi@@ red . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
the race stei@@ g Shuttle will therefore be ordered regularly on December 2017 .
the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle is a popular railway link between the railway stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
over the past few months , a pilot plant has been tested whether the route is used by a large number of people in order to order them regularly in the future .
the track is also very b@@ ump@@ y in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should be worried
just as you thought it can &apos;t become even more crazy in 2017 , a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots is coming .
yes , indeed .
sex robots are currently a big deal .
the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robo@@ tics ( FR@@ R ) recently published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , Emer@@ itus Professor of Robo@@ tics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d University and Co @-@ Fo@@ under of FR@@ R , we have to start taking their ascension seriously .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pp@@ le and the type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail .
&quot; people are funny about them , but the companies deliver a lot of them , and we &apos;ll see them much more often , &quot; said Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey at the release of his new report .
modern sex d@@ olls have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with deliberately human reactions reaching through artificial intelligence .
the user can &quot; adapt &quot; his robot according to his beliefs and select everything from the eye color of the robot to the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or colour of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails .
but it becomes even more disturbing since many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; that would make a Step@@ ford woman look progressive .
modern sex d@@ olls have developed into robots with a silicone skin .
for example , the Real@@ Bo@@ ti@@ x robot enables its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing such as sh@@ y@@ ness .
and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ xy gold sex robot developed by True Compan@@ ion , with pre @-@ programmed personalities like &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which im@@ parts the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an &quot; adv@@ entu@@ rous &quot; personality .
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality adapted to your personality as best as possible , &quot; enth@@ uses the site of True Compan@@ ion .
so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
she also has her mo@@ ods in the course of the day - just like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; she can be tired , be fixed on conversation , or she can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be in the mood &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships , but the sub@@ mis@@ sive female characteristics , the all@@ u@@ sions to rape , when one step on fri@@ gi@@ d ( i.e. here : reluc@@ tant ) Far@@ rah is concerned , wor@@ rying a most .
on his website true Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy has a vibr@@ ator but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men then have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; it says on the website .
however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just just another sex toy .
their emergence and increasing refin@@ ement point to something dark and deeper in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional en@@ core .
most men will of course have no sex robots , and while the FR@@ R noted their increasing popularity , they still remain on the br@@ ink of consumption culture .
but what le@@ aks out of the bor@@ der@@ lands can be very instruc@@ tive regarding the spirit of time in which we live .
and many people are not strange or insul@@ ting until the free market gives them permission .
there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots emerge in a time when women &apos;s rights are threatened by women around the world in which there is a president in the White House who has bo@@ asted women to have been sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted .
the most horri@@ ble aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the maid &apos; ) are not the graphic images , the intri@@ cate body and the st@@ och@@ astic eyes , but how realistic this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a jump , but at the moment it does not feel like a big jump .
the goal behind these sex robots is to produce a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as real@@ istically as technically possible ( even with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their gro@@ wers want them to feel human that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
but , brought to the point when it comes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots are not real women .
they cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away .
they have no mediation or background story , nothing suggest@@ ing independence or anything that might distur@@ b the imagination of total submission .
in other words , they are pleasing slaves .
or to put it in the words of 2017 : ma@@ ids
Tr@@ um@@ ps high performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of common sense
it has become a pl@@ ur@@ ality of the Tr@@ ump era that the political divisions which pol@@ arized US voters have also split families in small format .
around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving , there were newspapers in the USA with advice about how to deal with the horror of Tr@@ ump choosing relatives .
we all re@@ port@@ edly obey all of us in order to burst our filter bubbles .
less noticed is the power of Tr@@ um@@ ps to bring together families .
I mention this because my cous@@ in , a le@@ op@@ ard poet who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the re@@ public@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York .
it reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone who knows them , including the republi@@ can relationship with which she had fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and quite especi@@ al on the same side .
this is certainly a good thing around the dining table , but it is important to me that this also ent@@ ails considerable risks .
the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the det@@ ri@@ mental effect of his pres@@ idency has the power to push us all to the right .
when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and Tr@@ ump , we refer to the cre@@ ep@@ y possibility that his k@@ itt@@ ens will no longer be abor@@ ted .
there is , however , an even more complicated long @-@ term scenario , norm@@ alized in the Tr@@ ump Republi@@ cans of the right wing , which suddenly appear as the ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness in comparison to its standards .
I find myself today from an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s original version of the mad@@ man - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked out ) - both in comparison to Tr@@ ump in fact occur to one as very mild crimes .
when Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of the Republi@@ can only needs to be mentally healthy in order to qualify as an im@@ meas@@ urable improvement .
when my cous@@ in was in the city , we brought our children to the car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the largest of the New York park &apos;s car@@ ou@@ sels , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need caffeine .
the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are grow@@ ling and the animals twist to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climate @-@ per@@ mitting music conve@@ ys this in a strange way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of tall buildings become old , the sky@@ lines are too familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city is not just the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not completely over the day when I found that Swiss Cot@@ tage is not a Swiss Cot@@ tage in fact - the Them@@ e@@ Pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cot@@ tage counts not - but a big round@@ about in the north of London .
the Central Park car@@ ous@@ el is still a strange , magical experience , since two years old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ s can go on it and all have a great time .
if I could have evaluated the car@@ ous@@ el , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one asked for it .
on the other hand , I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before I could go through my credit card .
in the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same plus the option to balance the rating with a 15 % tip - this in order to buy something about the counter .
this not only leads to a slow@@ down of what should actually be a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required .
the poor woman in the department store stood dish@@ ear@@ tening , while I was tired of having the experience to submit my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us moves back to hospital with chest pain
for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital visit .
last year he was brought to the hospital because of the treatment of cuts on his w@@ ri@@ sts , which he suffered from prison authorities according to a case in his cell .
he was sentenced to a first death sentence for murder pursuant to an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early hours of Valentine &apos;s Day 2013 , firing them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ tori@@ a .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he kept his girlfriend for a noc@@ tur@@ nal inv@@ ader hiding in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors announced their intention to appeal this time against the six @-@ year jail sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us Appe@@ al , of which they say it was too len@@ i@@ ent .
the National prosecution authority said that it was lod@@ ged with the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the appeal could be heard this year .
Pist@@ ori@@ us is at risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
when farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the four @-@ door cars from F@@ arch@@ s and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were released into the holidays and in the secondary schools .
three students will attend secondary school in the future , four to the secondary school .
on Tuesday evening school director An@@ geli@@ ka Sit@@ te welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen .
the 29 pupils of the four classes under the direction of Sophi@@ a Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der chose a young eagle , who grew up in the chicken farm , but then released into freedom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the lively Sch@@ ar introduced a musical entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Eagle in the hen &apos;s yard &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and left it hat@@ ching from his chi@@ ckens .
instead of chi@@ ckens , a small eagle came out .
but the hope of making a chicken out of it broke , the eag@@ les spread its wings on a high mountain and s@@ wore .
then the classes showed three and four in the study of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken dance .
the h@@ ens d@@ anced with the young go@@ dd@@ les that bore cylinders to the bet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Eagle stands for integration , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Professor An@@ geli@@ ka Sit@@ te . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the young animal is different from the other k@@ itt@@ ens ( chi@@ cks ) , but belongs to it .
but he will never be like a chicken .
his destiny is to be free .
she wished to all four @-@ door cars that he felt accepted in his new school .
there was thanks to the colleagues , former school leader Michael Müller , who always ski@@ ps with instruc@@ tional passages , and the parents &apos; representatives .
the time of the cu@@ cum@@ bers is over , teacher Sophi@@ a Schumacher declared .
she only left her students very reluc@@ tant after two years of teaching , as it was a really great time .
finally , they can rely on the four @-@ pillar @-@ coupl@@ ers .
at the end all students took a song of summer time and vacation time .
with the children , great joy broke out among the children .
eight first @-@ grade pupils are already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians were arrested for illegal camps in Greece , issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted by television .
on the morning of August 1 , a group of illegal refugees were arrested in Si@@ th@@ onia by the police , including the two Bulg@@ arians .
on the same day , they were released , while an investigation is underway .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were released later .
the Greek authorities have tigh@@ tened control of the free camp and impose significant fin@@ es to anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose .
the controls will continue throughout the season .
the Ministry said that the court can impose a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what suffer@@ ers need to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers have to participate in the action ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group have offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars .
they are intended to improve emission characteristics of cars of emission classes Euro 5 and some euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are excluded .
An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anin of the ACE Auto Club Europa gives assessments :
is the new action obligatory ?
no , the negotiated software updates are optional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the obligatory updates previously only apply to the cars that have computer software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their retro@@ fitting has ordered the Federal Railway Authority ( KBA ) .
how and when are customers informed about updates ?
the manufacturers have announced spe@@ edy implementation in the next few months , but not yet named an exact date .
Daimler advised to write to anyone affected .
if an inspection is due anyway , it will be settled in its framework .
how long will the changes take place altogether ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ anine .
this depends on the commitment of the manufacturers as well as from political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for we have seen , the car manufacturers do not act on the subject of the environment until now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should the update take ?
the conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming can be to get an appointment .
what are drivers driving a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group ?
the ACE will advise you to wait .
presumably foreign manufacturers would follow up , so S@@ met@@ anin .
is there a massive drop in the price of Euro 4 cars ?
the ACE will fear that .
but in the regions where driving prohi@@ bitions thre@@ aten .
so far there has been no loss of value for older diesel in rural areas .
the ACE advises to wait with a sale .
ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of Washington &apos;s most gl@@ amor@@ ous events .
the first prize @-@ giving ceremony under President Tr@@ ump promises to become political .
one of the winners does not want to come - from protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is the first ra@@ pper to receive one of the cov@@ eted awards at the prestigious Kennedy Center .
as the cultural institution announced on Thursday , this year also singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the choreograph@@ er Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) are among the honored .
the awards are presented at the beginning of December .
traditionally , U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump will hold a reception and join the award together with his wife Mel@@ ania .
the winner of the award winner Le@@ ar announced with progressive TV series has already announced to refra@@ in from taking part in the gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this pres@@ idency has decided to negl@@ ect the arts and human rights - even to depri@@ ve them of the means - and that burdens me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an emphasized that she will use Tr@@ ump to clarify her viewpoint .
the Kennedy centre named after former President John F. Kennedy is the largest cultural institution in the US capital .
among the earlier prize winners are Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing .
we make the city worth living
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ lach Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , will reti@@ re next year .
the place is already written - but suitable candidates are rare .
for 31 years W@@ acker has been a City Engineer .
and the work makes him still great fun as he communic@@ ates in the press conference .
he reports on varied but challenging tasks waiting for his successor .
at the same time , it is surprising that until now no application has fulfilled the requirements profile .
the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time .
this should be enough time for a famili@@ ar@@ isation while resp@@ ecting the statutory periods of notice .
since Has@@ lach serves as the Lower Construction Law Office for the Administr@@ ative Community , the applicant must demonstrate appropriate conclusions .
for this function wants to keep the city in any case .
if it would not be able to fill this out , the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg for consultation .
but the proximity to the citizens is important to the city and to it , says W@@ acker , who reports from a good working climate and good atmosphere between the authority and the citizens .
over 30 years in office , some significant projects have accumulated to look back at the W@@ acker with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city worth living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure about the construction office and its employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future , diverse projects are on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the low @-@ level parking area around are encountered .
the Kin@@ zig bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium refur@@ bish@@ ment is still subject to change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter will hit the book with around 1.5 million euros , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do it right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker appreci@@ ates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , great tasks await my successor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
design was available for a Stadt@@ bau@@ meister of great scope .
with Has@@ lach &apos;s own yard and gar@@ dener can be re@@ acted to many quite flexibly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces is often refer@@ enced by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the old town as an ensemble is under monument protection , it is important to &quot; have an eye for what fits in , &quot; when new buildings are approved , the out@@ going city building master emphasizes .
anyway , the City Engineer is responsible for a high level of responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is a builder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end , everything runs over my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with care and coordination , he can count on many years of work : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been there for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) has been working for 15 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also , that his successor remains for a long time , W@@ acker wants : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good working climate , but also for the further design of the city .
according to the city of Has@@ lach , whoever wants to bequ@@ e@@ ath Roland W@@ acker should have completed a degree in degree as a diploma engineer or a bach@@ elor &apos;s degree in the field of architecture and have good knowledge in the fields of construction planning and planning law .
the Stadt@@ bau@@ amt are building high and civil engineering , building guidelines , building instruction , administration of urban properties , urban depot with building yard and urban gardening and underground building rights authority , including monument protection .
bicycle thrown on lines : the South railway line blocked
according to the police , the previously unknown perpet@@ rators had thrown the blue bicycle from the rail@@ road crossing in the area of Le@@ oben Haupt@@ strasse ( B@@ 116 ) .
these were so badly damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male offen@@ ders and have been looking for them since the night .
near the crime scene , a ro@@ ot@@ tish sco@@ oter and a bicycle driver were observed .
&quot; this goes far beyond a land of Lausanne , &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokesperson Christoph Pos@@ ch as the AP@@ A .
the perpet@@ rators , or the perpet@@ rators , would have put themselves in danger and also je@@ op@@ ardi@@ se the traffic .
in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant , as well as the delay of delay and the costs for the shipping traffic , P@@ arib@@ als of the railway customers could also be sent to the perpet@@ rators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; overall , there was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; considerable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damage was repaired on Friday afternoon , the rail traffic on the South railway line could be run without obstacles .
nearly ten people had dropped out on Friday morning , two of them concerned the long @-@ distance traffic .
freight trains did not fall out , but they had delay .
according to Ö@@ BB @-@ spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch , around 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts have also been damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help relieve IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease )
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
but a new study claims just the opposite : a diet rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
the incur@@ able condition , which affects approximately 1.3 million in the US and 300@@ ,000 in the United States , causes stomach cr@@ amps and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recurring or bloody diar@@ rhe@@ a , weight loss , and extreme ti@@ redness .
while the suffer@@ ers are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to allevi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant bow@@ el .
the leading researcher , Dr Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells are pat@@ rolling in the intest@@ ines in order to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in food do not penetrate the body .
cells that are able to trigger inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging delicate tissues .
if the balance is too far towards inflammation , it can result in inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
in experiments , it was found that a kind of tolerance promoted immune cell in mice that carry a certain bacter@@ ium in their intest@@ ines .
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han , one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have established a connection between a bacteria species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han had mice in their food , the more they had of these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and a diet toler@@ ant of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ e encourages more toler@@ able , less inflammatory intestinal mi@@ lie@@ us if the same system also works with humans .
the post@@ doctoral researcher Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan investig@@ ates a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found out that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same family , who had been separated , had not .
they suspected that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bial chromos@@ omes had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , which usually live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract .
the mice of mice were sequ@@ enced and six bacteria species found in mice with immune cells were found , but were missing in mice .
mice were raised in a sterile environment so that they did not develop an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome and they did not develop this type of immune cells , and they were created by L. reu@@ ter@@ i and immune cells .
to understand the effects of bacteria on the immune system , the researchers led L. reu@@ ter@@ i to grow in a fluid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid without the bacteria - to im@@ mature immune cells isolated from the mice .
the immune cells developed into the toler@@ ant cells .
when the active component was puri@@ fied from the liquid , it proved to be a by @-@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism , known as i@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid .
if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the feed of the mice , the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan declared that humans have the same tolerance @-@ promoting cells such as mice , and that most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i protect our gastro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts .
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes related to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han have been found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote since these cells control inflammation on the intestinal surface . &quot; &quot; &quot;
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values can lead to expansion of this population in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes Manchester United has committed a &quot; genius &quot; to N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic signed a &quot; genius &quot; at Manchester United , Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that on Wednesday evening the mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria .
the 40 million pound signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last high season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup ki@@ cks off against Real Madrid on Tuesday , and impressed in the Halter role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira mar@@ ched at will .
matic was , however , excluded from the preparation Asia tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes , which M@@ our@@ in@@ ho admitted that he had to improve before the premi@@ er league season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; M@@ our@@ in@@ ho said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will help him to be ready sooner than later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lin@@ del &apos;s and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u also started in the Avi@@ va stadium , when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho formed his start @-@ XI for the beginning of the season .
the Independent disclosed this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho desired three new commitments , but he insist@@ ed that the club had already done a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfil three of its four priority obligations .
&quot; to get three out of four , I thank the association , &quot; he added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four from four for me , but they have taken great trouble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the aircraft manufacturer Boeing has drawn the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner into the sky .
the pilots flew off Seattle in the US state of Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state of Mich@@ igan and moved to the form of a dre@@ am@@ liner about the USA , which are several thousand kilometres .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
the form of a Dream@@ liner was to be on the radar screens .
the whole was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing already had such advertisement earlier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus the number &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the Boeing logo were drawn into the sky . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new draft for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as the wind turns out : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was the SPD leader , the Social @-@ Democratic Prime Minister always looked at Berlin with a certain concern before elections .
only there were no fire @-@ fires from the party centre , but no counter @-@ wind from the Cov@@ en@@ ant - that was the most important wish of the electoral batt@@ ali@@ ons .
since Martin Schulz has led the party , this has changed fundamentally .
since then , the staff from the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ House with a growing horror view the events in the SPD @-@ governed regional capitals .
what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described in the approach with the opposite wind .
there were set@@ backs .
and one after another .
the federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against coalition of SPD and Gre@@ ens following the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this once again shows that red @-@ green can &apos;t rule reliably , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary General Peter Tau@@ ber to the editorial office Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the surprise faction of a Green Party de@@ pu@@ ties the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) in a serious crisis .
five months before the Sunday election , his red @-@ green coalition finally lost its one @-@ vote majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green League executive Michael Kell@@ ner called on the back@@ sliding Lower Sax@@ on Green Party member El@@ ke T@@ westen to return her mandate .
the transition to the CD@@ U means a clear fal@@ si@@ fication of the voters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ ke T@@ westen must immediately return her mandate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the German executive and election campaign leader of the Green Party Editorial Board ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an SPD vot@@ er si@@ ghs when the new job &apos;s message is reached on Friday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , is there after the surrender of the green de@@ pu@@ ties El@@ ke T@@ westen to the CD@@ U without a majority of its own government majority .
it is the preliminary cul@@ mination of a series of large and small crises in the SPD national feder@@ ations .
and nobody knows what comes next .
the Mis@@ ers began with the un@@ expect@@ edly clear defeat at the Saarland election in March .
a blue eye , no more , the comrades so@@ oth@@ ed themselves .
after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
that was the case - and everything was going to be much worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the thro@@ es , the Dus@@ sel@@ dorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te swe@@ pt the party smoothly .
in the weeks afterwards , the comrades rose lab@@ ori@@ ously .
then , when they had just picked up new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit of Hamburg came .
and with him came the next set@@ back .
mayor O@@ la@@ f Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD leader , lost his Nim@@ bus this weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie , while his city was burning .
and because afterwards he did everything wrong in crisis communication , what you can do wrong .
since then , Sch@@ olz fights for his political survival .
now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
because of the VW @-@ exhaust @-@ mood and its role on the Supervisory Board , the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony had already been in criticism for quite some time .
mi@@ ese surveys were added .
nevertheless , or perhaps precisely because of this , Wei@@ l tried to establish accents in the Con@@ federation in recent weeks .
the efforts of the former mayor of Hanover , to expand his power in Berlin , did not remain hidden in the context of Martin Schulz .
they allowed him to grant him a stabili@@ zation of the party by Wei@@ l .
now the exact opposite could occur .
at the same time , Wei@@ l is not guilty of the internal party &apos;s internal constra@@ int of the Green @-@ Sax@@ on Gre@@ ens .
and Schulz is not at all .
at the same time , comrades try to keep their own ranks closed .
their anger is directed at the Gre@@ ens , and especially to the revol@@ ting parliam@@ ent@@ arians , T@@ westen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is int@@ ol@@ erable and democratic , as Mrs. T@@ westen represents her own career interests over the interests of all others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , leader of the party left in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. T@@ westen has not been elected as a direct candidate because of her person , but on the country list of the Lower Sax@@ on Green Party in parliament .
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , lam@@ ents an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ democratic maneu@@ ver . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the elec@@ torate four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan Wei@@ l the prime minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Sax@@ on SPD to the Bundestag election , the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the personal career of a future CD@@ U member distor@@ ts the election result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he called for clari@@ fying the background .
I want to know if there has been more or has given further commitments to the CD@@ U Nieder@@ sachsen .
sponsor@@ ing Tips for City Center III
if you want to renov@@ ate the old house , you will be able to get support from the country soon .
in addition , mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives of St@@ eg Urban Development arrived in sens@@ ations on Wednesday .
at the beginning of the information session , Sch@@ in@@ dler gave a review of what happened so far .
since 1991 , there have been sens@@ ations in rehabilitation areas .
at that time , in the refur@@ bish@@ ment area I from 1991 to 2004 , the Land Baden @-@ Württemberg adopted two thirds of the subsi@@ dy amount .
in the restructuring area II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still at 60 percent .
for Sch@@ in@@ dler , the previous refur@@ bish@@ ments are a &quot; success project &quot; - it is finally important to promote internal development and not only to open up new building areas .
on April 4 , I received the information from the Regier@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium Karlsruhe , that there will be a restructuring area III .
the sum of the subsi@@ dy amounts to 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 euros , of which 500 000 Euros are from the country , the rest of the community sensi@@ ti@@ sed .
how does a remedi@@ ation area develop ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; one will continue to investigate Sch@@ in@@ dler where the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really old &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it also plays a role if there are any interest in the planned area to rehabil@@ itate .
if necessary , the regional boundaries could also shift again .
the bridge was held on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
Keller presented the contents of the federal state program &quot; Social City , &quot; in which the re@@ struc@@ tur@@ ings would then be carried out .
core of the programme are the re@@ vit@@ alization of inner cities , improving living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure .
the measures would be carried out object @-@ related , that is per property .
the re@@ development area would then finally be set up as by@@ laws .
the grant period for the funding is ongoing on 1 January 2017 until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
until September this year , however , the survey will take place only once , within the framework of those involved in the rehabilitation area to fill out a questionnaire .
in November or December , it is planned to take place as soon as possible , so that the refur@@ bish@@ ments can begin next year .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann then explained that each commun@@ e must carry out the aforementioned preliminary examinations .
it is about evaluating and deciding when the urban ab@@ norm@@ alities are being renovated and to what extent .
there will also be a re@@ mark in the land register for each piece of land .
Pi@@ et@@ sch@@ mann will come again to sensi@@ gen and get a picture of the situation , she promised .
Got@@ zel stressed that the participation of the participants is a key success factor for the project .
therefore , there will be questionn@@ aires that will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and can be completed by the end of the summer holidays .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; building and property sheet &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; with which it concerns the structural condition and the restructuring prospects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the grey questionnaire , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Haushalts@@ - und Wohnungs@@ wirtschaft &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; information about the size , division and residents of a residential area can be made . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rain@@ bow &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is only to be filled if business premises are operated in the building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it must be noted that a completed questionnaire was not simultaneously an application for funding .
in addition , new construction measures are not eligible for funding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sch@@ in@@ dler still stressed that the distribution of the subsidies after the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - who comes first , grin@@ ds first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can &apos;t reserve funds for later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; finally , photos of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Location II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were shown to make the present a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refur@@ bish@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
British invent@@ or uses a micro@@ chip to get into house and car with a hand movement
a British invent@@ or is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his door@@ step , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement .
Steven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology through his company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , a consult@@ ative an@@ aes@@ th@@ esi@@ sten at the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedures are performed according to medical standards .
the technology resembles a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and takes only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. Nor@@ th@@ am also wants to change the locks on houses and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip , all for an additional cost of £ 300 per lock .

the advertising costs of the White House cost tax@@ pay@@ ers thousands
the White House &apos;s decision to fly a nav@@ al helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that highlights the American production last month will cost tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the military provided to TI@@ ME Magazine , up to $ 24@@ ,000 .
the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the cent@@ er@@ piece of the event on 17 July in the White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior civil servants of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states .
the Connec@@ tic@@ ut helicopter was on display next to a Ma@@ ine yacht , a Wisconsin fire engine and a Miss@@ issi@@ ppi fork lift truck .
the White House &apos;s military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the records of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit that is responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with a high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event his superior , the Deputy Military Commander for Aviation .
the message showed that the helicopter arrived at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning on the South La@@ wn for the event at 3 p.m. and until the tur@@ f was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House is delayed , a second team would be required for the return flight due to the restriction of the service hours .
the original crew was during the meeting during the helicopter while the security personnel remained on the ground by the aircraft during the time .
at the disposal of the TI@@ ME , it was not clear whether a second flight had been necessary .
the H@@ atch Act forbi@@ ds federal states to use state property for political purposes .
records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event could hurt the determination .
&quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the commander .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sounds like you &apos;re locked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; answered the deputy commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the event &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but official events also have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the president gave an imp@@ etus for the reform of the health reform , which was in progress in the Senate and he propag@@ ated efforts to con@@ strain government regulations .
the use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One is hardly a new phenomenon .
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for the journey .
but to request their use only for a photo operation is unusual .
in February , Tr@@ ump carried out an investigation when the presidential jet was in front of his first campaign r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages compl@@ aining about the use of the President &apos;s aircraft .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House is delighted with the show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 states produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws often perform training flights in the Washington area and South La@@ wn area in order to offset the US president in the White House with precise centimet@@ ers .
when Tr@@ ump was at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 introduced 58 exercise land@@ ings in the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event counted at the training needs of the crew &apos;s crew for the month , said a civil servant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
helicopter units also flew 11 hours on this day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions . &quot;
the White House said the tax@@ pay@@ ers took over the burden of none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man of Si@@ kor@@ sky said the company had not been involved in putting the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not maintain budget labels for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per flight hour .
records of the unit recorded the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers based on estimates for ref@@ unds is most mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs contained in the annual funding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 , the reimbur@@ sement rates for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but also take into account the cost of fuel , maintenance and contract completion .
at that time the former spokes@@ man of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the deployment of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; the idea is to present things that are produced in America this week , &quot; Sp@@ ic@@ er said .
&quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ tic@@ ut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not thousands of people are dependent on it .
and I think like most Americans , we are all proud of helicop@@ ters and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
of course it is appropriate to highlight that . &quot;
it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump inter@@ acted with the helicopter while he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire engine .
in the White House Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and j@@ oked with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss a tri@@ cky task
leader of the Second Tennis German league takes place at the table third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
the TC Blau @-@ Weiss Ne@@ uss will be appearing tomorrow at 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel , at the table third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
in spite of five games still flaw@@ less balance , the leader of the Second Tennis German League has got the sense of reality .
team principal Mari@@ us Z@@ ay , at any rate , has respect for the opponent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team that always plays in a very similar formation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially in the rear positions I find the team very good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
imports from the high North mainly provide for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their Danish and Finn@@ s can even point to st@@ akes in the Davis Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and they are also strong in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay , looking at Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas B@@ jer@@ us ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s going to be hard for us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you also need a good deal of luck . &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser team for the trip to the high North is practically .
his debut for blue wh@@ ites could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ us .
won &apos;t the Fren@@ ch@@ man active Fren@@ ch@@ man currently playing at the Chall@@ enger Tournam@@ ent in the Italian Bi@@ ella , won the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) playing at the tournament in the Czech Liber@@ ec in this season .

how America can harm O@@ MV
Donald Tr@@ ump did not really feel happy when he put his signature on Wednesday evening under the law to tigh@@ ten sanctions against Russia .
&quot; in his ha@@ ste to en@@ act the law , &quot; the Congress adopted a few &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions . &quot;
the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels was fo@@ aming against the US thrust .
after all , the draft plans to punish a European company that will help the Russians build pi@@ pelines in the EU .
since then , investors in the O@@ MV , which co @-@ financed the construction of the Russian eastern soul North Stream 2 together with other European companies , are correspon@@ dingly troubled .
the dr@@ one setting is enormous .
however , it is too early for an assessment of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil company .
in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump should raise the sanctions even by an executive order .
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has looked at which of the Group could defl@@ ect and which could really hurt him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nar@@ cos Season 3 Tra@@ iler : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar , the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el will be placed in the center of the charts of Net@@ fli@@ x
despite the second season of Nar@@ co , which reveals Pablo Es@@ co@@ bars K@@ iller , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x has not been over for a long time .
the three and four ech@@ el@@ ons were already confirmed by the streaming service , the first one received their first trailer and showed the latest vil@@ la@@ ins of the show .
with the third season , DE@@ A has focused its attention on the rich@@ est organisation of the world &apos;s drug trade : the Cal@@ i @-@ cart@@ el .
led by four powerful god@@ parents , they operate as &quot; Fort@@ une 500 companies &quot; only with more state bri@@ bes and violent actions .

roll back : the city provides 46 kitchen aids
the city organizes its own lunch table .
with fixed contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team .
the clock is turned back in the day@@ care centers .
as of 1 September , the city of Kre@@ feld takes over the food supply in the day@@ care centres ( Kit@@ as ) again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , deputy head of the youth welfare department , this is a good news : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were all very pleased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it continues to be cooked outside the house : a cat@@ erer under@@ takes this task and delivers freshly cooked cooled .
the town runs 46 day@@ care centers in the Kre@@ feld area , in 44 children get a hot meal at lunch@@ time .
in the year of Kit@@ a@@ year 28@@ 00 children were sitting at the tables , and the demand continues to grow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , not only children , who are cared for 45 days of the week , have lunch in the K@@ ita , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer also applies in the 35 @-@ hour supervision when children remain until 14 o &apos;clock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 part @-@ time employees have kitchen service starting on September 1st : they warm up the delivered meals , complement it with salad , raw food and fruit , por@@ tioning the meal individually , spread the food , clean off , rinse and clean the kitchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; employees are firmly assigned to a ita , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the size - there are two groups as well as sev@@ ent@@ een units - decides over the ho@@ ur@@ ly circum@@ ference .
&quot; the kitchen assistants are now part of the K@@ ita team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ ie .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much more involved and it is easier for the management to implement ped@@ ago@@ gical concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because that &apos;s what it &apos;s all about : healthy eating and cooking lessons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children should help prepare food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen force to the team is reasonable .
also for the children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have a well @-@ known force in the K@@ ita , a person familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
the cleaning of the K@@ ita premises - previously also the task of the kitchen personnel - will be carried out by special cleaning staff in the future .
this variation - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - besides the quality improvement of the kitchen performance , also has the charm that it turned out to be the most economical in the cost comparison between self @-@ control and foreign lending for the city , it is from the press office .
and this , although 46 part @-@ time forces are read@@ ju@@ sted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours are not so much in weight with around 750 people in the field of education , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afgh@@ an democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN
elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ som , President of the United Nations Mission , said that hundreds of women will run for Council elections in the provinces . three women candidates for the role of the vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
elections can only be really representative and credible when women are fully participating and included in all parts of the election process .
the elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections take place on 5 April .
the Tali@@ ban has published threats against a choice process that coinci@@ des with the transition from international combat actions to an advisory role .
this year , the elections for the first time will be handed over peac@@ efully from a democr@@ atically elected government to the next .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ on said , a strong role for women will reinforce the democratic success of Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Afgh@@ an Independent Elec@@ toral Commission reports that 1.2 million women of a total of 3,@@ 6 million voters are registered .

according to the police information , the men spoke to the 13 @-@ year @-@ old who stopped with friends at the Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ straße , around 2.@@ 55 a.m. because they wanted to telephone the girl &apos;s mobile phone .

G@@ MB concern about investment in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glasgow
a union wants to ensure the long @-@ term commitment to production at its plant in Glasgow , near managers of the Bis@@ cuit manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie .
G@@ MB Scotland said the company was weighing over the future of investment at the T@@ oll@@ cross site .
more than 500 employees work in the factory , which produces hob@@ no@@ bs and rich tea bis@@ cuits in addition to other products .
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that workers and union representatives would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; learn first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if their activities change . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a letter to the company &apos;s branch manager , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s insist@@ ed that the financing for modernis@@ ation of production lines will not be pushed forward . &quot;
G@@ MB @-@ Senior organis@@ er Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; the fact that we cannot gain clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross , our members are deeply concerned .
families have worked here and the workers concentrated strongly on the local community and the Greater Glasgow , an important pillar for decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage .
therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wages and prosperity , and against the background of the Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic decline of production , the eastern end of Glasgow really needs a flour@@ ishing production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ woman of Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the branch manager at T@@ oll@@ cross has only received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland yesterday , and the company will react directly to it as we value the continued commitment to employees and trade union representatives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed .
we discussed with the employees that like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , we constantly review our business - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few years , we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross site , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we recognize the legacy of T@@ oll@@ cross as a place of production fully and completely . if our operations change at the site , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona have warned three years before N@@ ey@@ mar ?
the page of La League may regret its interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not abandon N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s persecution following an offer of £ 18@@ 9 million to release its release clause , but have they warned Barcelona three years ago before the world record ?
the sensational approach has heated the transfer window in summer , because the League 1 club is ready to beat the world record by more than double the previous mark , with Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United last season for 89 million pounds .
after finishing , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the world &apos;s highest paid professional ath@@ lete . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500@@ ,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way outside , although a source near the Catal@@ ans Board insist@@ ed that the club always did his best to take care of him since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 .
but was the football world warned three years ago by the PS@@ G President before this prospect ?
when Manchester City expressed interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i in 2014 , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for each club , which wanted to sign one of the best players of PS@@ G .
&quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players , we will stand in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi .
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to sign one of our players by themselves , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , whereby the Spanish club expressed interest in the PS@@ G mid @-@ field player Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer .
PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to travel under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar .
sco@@ oter tos@@ sed and damaged
in the night of Friday on Saturday , an unknown killer has deliberately kno@@ cked off a sco@@ oter in the Königs@@ feld street in front of the property number 30 and so on the fair@@ ing of the vehicle damaged material damage of more than 200 Euro .

the police are looking for witnesses for an accident at the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese .

on Thursday evening the 34 year old from Reh@@ burg @-@ L@@ occ@@ um was on the B 215 coming from Stol@@ zen@@ au on the B 215 coming from Stol@@ zen@@ au in the direction of Le@@ ese .
in the area of the location of Stol@@ zen@@ au , a passenger car came to meet him in his lane so that he had to devi@@ ate to the right .

the driver of the passenger car , a Mercedes Benz , had over@@ taken a truck and continued his journey without wor@@ rying about the traffic accident .
according to the accident victims , it can be good that the ced@@ es@@ driver had not noticed the accident at all .

&quot; &quot; &quot; interview : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report reli@@ eves Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report on the mis@@ use cases reli@@ eves Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
that means author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides further discussions .
Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokes@@ man for the reform movement &quot; Wir sind Kirche , &quot; declared after publication in relation to the German press agency , he acquired an ap@@ ology from the former Regensburg bishop and present Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as by the Cathedral Choir Master Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the em@@ eri@@ zed Pope Bene@@ dict XVI .
it would serve the pres@@ tige of the Catholic Church when Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger express their deep regret about their own la@@ yo@@ ffs or their false app@@ rais@@ al of the proceedings at that time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Vatican newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; on the other hand , critic@@ ised that in reporting about violence in the domain cats , it was measured with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two measures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in regard to the attacks in Regensburg , no one doubts that it is &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful deeds , &quot; which would have to be pun@@ ish@@ able and prevented in the future ; however , the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the National Italian Bio@@ ethics Committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the habit of calling the Catholic Church as the source of all evil is already part of everyday life and prepares public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis said in an interview with Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk : &quot; you like to go to the church and this is a found fres@@ co . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she also pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put@@ ts have been a quite normal educational tool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be done with che@@ ek@@ y children , as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they found it unfair to apply today &apos;s standards to earlier decades , as the world has changed .
in connection with the reports about mis@@ use cases , pop@@ e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared .
author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who auth@@ ored R@@ atz@@ inger , wrote the book &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) .
&quot; I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report .
what exactly is written in the 440 @-@ page report presented by the Council of Regensburg , Ulrich Weber , who was commissioned by the dioc@@ ese of Regensburg ?
a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen ( Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen ) were brut@@ ally ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s , &quot; with high plau@@ sibility . &quot;
in the final report it was named Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary , it can be said that in many cases Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister was used in many cases of physical and psychological violence .
especially with high emotion@@ ality , the punishment for the students was even more violent .
in contrast to many other accused , however , many victims rated the general humanity of R. and , in many cases , even have positive memories of him . &quot;
in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal of the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) is reli@@ eved of his opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Viol@@ ation of Viol@@ ence in Prot@@ ected Sites at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gives a contradictory picture of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger Cathedral Choir . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the one hand , many students emphasize their &quot; humanity . &quot;
on the other hand , he also appears as ch@@ ol@@ eric and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , who became tangible to the latter , when a Dom@@ sp@@ atz had no top performance musi@@ cally .
how do you evaluate this final report as his bi@@ ograph@@ er ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long story from the front to the back , you have to ask why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is common at all .
he is currently dedicated to eight pages and is clearly exemp@@ ted from any suspicion of complic@@ ity or complic@@ ity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the violence in the pre @-@ school also occurred outside of its sphere of influence .
at best , one can reproach it , experience it too late or have taken first hints not seriously enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um , on which he worked , was perceived by virtually all respon@@ dents as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; redemption , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; better world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is how the vast majority of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s students have a very excellent certificate , &quot; sincer@@ ely , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; honest , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as an extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher who regularly provided the boys with cakes , bis@@ cuits and cand@@ y and &quot; always surrounded by grapes of children . &quot;
only a minority compl@@ ains about its perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high emotion@@ ality , which also led to flood breaks .
the fact that he did not only kne@@ ad with chairs and threw the key@@ ring on the ground , but also drawn ear @-@ cow@@ ards and over@@ turned che@@ ek@@ y guys on the hair or ears , he had already admitted years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it .
to its salvation , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the time , the 1960s and 1970s , in both parents and teachers .
do you still know such methods of breeding ?
of course , I think everyone of us who was born before 1968 .
I also experienced this in a secular school , a state grammar school .
however , compared to what it actually deals with in this report , namely , the horri@@ fic sexual abuse and the violence exc@@ esses at the pres@@ ch@@ ool , these are indeed bag@@ at@@ elles .
one wonders whether it is not about his fame and his role as a brother of Bene@@ dict XVI that many media rus@@ hed straight on him .
in the Bavarian pop@@ e many , who have never understood Him , still work eag@@ erly .
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
the media reported a great deal of abuse during the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen affair in connection with the report .
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger responsible in the final report any involvement or complic@@ ity with regard to sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , no .
not one of 67 victims of sexual assault is claiming to have become familiar with the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were initiated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never dar@@ ed to talk about it with my father or mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of those affected , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real problem with the explanation of sexual abuse was and is , however , that most of the victims are silent .
if they didn &apos;t even entr@@ ust themselves to parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , certainly not a ch@@ oral conductor , who , professionally , would have been a colleague of the cul@@ pr@@ its .
how do the cats of the Dom@@ sp@@ itz play R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in regard to mis@@ use cases ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ able student formulated it so : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) would have had timely insights and could have stopped the respective perpet@@ r@@ ator .
I think it ... even for really absurd to assume that it is calculated to him ... bubbles intru@@ sive or clearer or even more opened than in front of their parents , dormit@@ ory managers , teachers of trust , etc .
that you talk about sex with him ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this concludes the report on the very clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation that affected students and / or their environment were entrusted to him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as for sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus acqu@@ itted of all co @-@ existence .
so it cannot be accused of having prevented or displaying it .
therefore there is no reason to connect his good name to these vile crimes , as unfortunately occurred in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the media there was much to read about &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Viol@@ ence @-@ Viol@@ ence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former cathedral master Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looking away &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem that everything is mixed and mixed in the reporting to a huge amount of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere , right in the middle of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but this is precisely the mis@@ use of the report .
namely , there is a clean separation : between the pre @-@ school and the high school of the domain spar@@ rows , between sexual abuse and violence , and , let us say , other accus@@ ations .
in addition , the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945 , so also for four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not Chief of the Cathedral Treas@@ ury .
all the horri@@ ble test ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases in which boys of sa@@ di@@ st teachers were sc@@ ram@@ bled and portra@@ yed and dre@@ amed of them , took place at the pres@@ ch@@ ool in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where there were really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions .
but with them , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister had nothing to do with Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because he got the boys first to face when they were already on the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um .
on this , as most witnesses emphas@@ ise , the topic of &quot; pre @-@ school &quot; tab@@ oo .
one was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; par@@ adi@@ si@@ ac@@ al &quot; conditions .
what was different at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there was discipline , but no sa@@ di@@ stic violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report concludes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many victims rated the general humanity of R. and , in many cases , even combine positive memories with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at most , the accus@@ ation remains to be taken away .
but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre @-@ school .
the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he just started to establish himself and was responsible for the events at a school where he was not working and responsible , ( as the witness ) did not want to hear , and then back to 1993 .
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger resol@@ utely shut the ears in front of the states ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the domain gymn@@ asi@@ um , which the report even re@@ produces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this he points out that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the prepar@@ atory school , the punishment will continue to be practiced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the danger of negative press releases , it recommended urgent intervention .
this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity was , as test pun@@ ish@@ ments were banned long ago in Bavaria .
before that , they happened in a legal grey area , as each of us probably knows .
it was also difficult for him to assess where the affected persons might be exagger@@ ated or dram@@ ati@@ zed and where really the permissible limit was exceeded .
but you can &apos;t say he always looked away .
that &apos;s just not true .
only in 1980 the punishment of schools was officially aboli@@ shed in Bavaria .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn and Ta@@ xis maintained that it was unfair to apply today &apos;s ped@@ ago@@ gical standards to that time .
how do you see that ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we histori@@ ans speak of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fall@@ acy of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; i.e. the danger of judging the past according to today &apos;s moral standards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the princess has already been right .
but this , of course , does not apply to sexual abuse , which at all times was abom@@ in@@ able and also not for what was broken in the pres@@ ch@@ ool of ad@@ versity and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls , that goes far beyond what happened at that time .
that &apos;s all very aw@@ ful and I &apos;m glad that it will finally be worked up .
but at the same time I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection because all this had nothing to do with him .
his means of discipl@@ ining and pun@@ ishing , i.e. drawing ear @-@ cow@@ ards and in the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .
when physical punishment was then banned , he kept strictly adher@@ ing to it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what picture of his Regensburg time has Georg R@@ atz@@ inger reproduced in the talks with you for the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
was the subject of test punishment also available ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it &apos;s about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Bene@@ dict XVI . , from his perspective , the domain spar@@ rows only played a minor role .
nevertheless , I did not devi@@ ate from the fact that he was conducting a strict regi@@ ment there .
but this must be said once : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without demanding discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world @-@ rank , true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with bis@@ cuits and cand@@ y alone you don &apos;t even make a big singer and stand before every success , whatever area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming .
what kind of people did you see Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in talking about her book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and in addition , I met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger very well and again and again experienced a wonderful , humor@@ ous , very good @-@ hear@@ ted , deeply beli@@ ever and heart @-@ good man , from which one can &apos;t imagine that he could only hurt a fly .
today , 23 years after his em@@ eri@@ tierung , I get regular contact with him , visit him , read it - he &apos;s almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family .
those who have not yet forgiven him that he was once strict with them , are thus clearly in the minority .
most of the domain spar@@ s are thank@@ ful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music .
and that he is always a good , pat@@ ernal teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also a lo@@ vable dis@@ respect , to which they still look up today and which they virtually rever@@ e .
and please , once again quite clearly : all that you are accused of are educational methods that were on the agenda at that time .
we can be happy that we have long overcome this time .
but it is highly un@@ just , a man just because he is promin@@ ently and has an even more prominent brother to make a medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
there is the evil intent behind it , only too obvious .
the report , which has just been published , reli@@ eves it .
now the insurrection would command a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who has acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany probably nobody would know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , at last in peace .
