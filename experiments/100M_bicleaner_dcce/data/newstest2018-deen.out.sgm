<seg id="2">An Irish institution, where teenagers should meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A chapel of mine where it is now dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Farmers cultivate the former cause of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is annoying when maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everybody knows this because the car navigation system showed a green meadow instead of a bypass road.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bavaria Atlases, an offer of the Geoportas Bavaria of the state government, are anything but current - yet very informative.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when comparing them with current online maps.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and communities in the spread-area of the Munich Mercury have changed since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern-Atlas is a flickering carpet, which one cannot recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">Maps, so-called position sheets, have been incorporated into the large picture map for cities and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">These were created according to the Bavarian State surveying department between 1810 and 1864 and are the beginning of Bavaria's first survey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader has occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wished to get an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even though the French troops marched off with the peace of Lunéville on February 9, 1801, it was the present-day neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern-map.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "Elector Max IV Joseph continued the project, founded the" "" "Topographic Bureau" "" "- and thus the Bavarian surveying management." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">The composition sheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and is to be found on the Bayerische Landesbibliothek 'website.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison morning / Today is most impressive in the example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">One example of this is undersendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was employed 21 years after the creation of the map, i.e. 1877, as a district of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, Untersendling is in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along today's Plinganserstraße, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the revolt of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today is the Westpark, one sees nothing but fields - at first sight: when zooming in, a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears: handwritten numbered flutes from the so-called "Urption," from which the landed property was derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">Small plots are no longer occupied by farmers, but small gardeners of the plant "land in the sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">Theresienwiese, the scene of the October festival since 1810, was indeed a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desires.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the area of today's Au-Haidhausen district, one reads not only the street name at the "Gasteig" or from the hill "Auf der Lüften" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt."</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße, one once locked people with insanity.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "in 1858 / 59 the Munich District Irrenaissance" "" "Auf der Auer Lüften" "" "was created." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed the institution - the psychiatrist, who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "he was progressive for his time, and for example ended up ankulating the so-called" "" "Irish" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">He also prohibited the personnel from using force against the occupants, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who worked for an exhibition with the institution.</seg>
<seg id="37">There was room for 280 patients, later it was expanded to 500 places.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point, this capacity did not suffice any more - the reason for the construction of the "Kreisirrenanstalt" in Haar [1905].</seg>
<seg id="39">The Isar-Amper-Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="40">Young people in the Munich Salesians are now meeting on the site of the former Auer Anstalt.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and turned it into a youth home with educational establishments.</seg>
<seg id="42">West is the football field of the TSV Munich East, east of residential buildings of the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was built in architectural style to the original building of the Irrenaissance, which was destroyed during the Second World War by bombing raids.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "the Marienplatz was listed as" "" "Main Square" "" "in 1856, the Kaufinger street was called" "" "Kaufinger Gasse" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">In December 1944, the Allies bombed a lot of holes in the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="47">A great remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English institute, small business houses and a tomb chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where these days are preparatory work and on 5 April 2017 the ground-breaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn circle route takes place.</seg>

<seg id="50">Civil Rights Group Published Travel Warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "the National Association for the Advancement of Farmers has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Missouri due to discriminatory policies and racist attacks." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">"" "" "" "the NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which will enter into force by 28 August 2017, calls on afro-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention while travelling through the state, as a number of questionable, racial-based incidents occur in the entire state and be noted here," "" "says the group." ""</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "a recently adopted Missouri law that makes it more difficult for people to recover" "" "discrimination complaints" "" "as well as the prosecution authorities of the state who disproportionately aim to minorities, said the NAACP." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "they have violations of civil rights which happen to people." ""</seg>
<seg id="55">They are stopped because of their skin colour, they are beaten or killed, "said the President of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group cited events such as racist crime against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died at the beginning of the year in questionable circumstances, after he had no petrol during the journey through the state and was put into custody by the police of Missouri without being accused of a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also points out a recent report from Missouri's Office of General Attorney, which shows that black motorists in the state will be 75 percent more common than whites.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," "" "said Mays." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "people need to be ready to see if they have any chewing-money or let relatives know they travel through the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri reported 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the hate crime report program of the FBI, which classifies the state in relation to the number of such violations to the 16th place of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to accuse a company for housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, after the States had passed immigration laws that would oblige local prosecution authorities to arrest people due to migration violations, which according to the ACLU will contribute to further racial benefit.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but lately interest groups have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">The fence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fischbacher Weidenaun project is a successful project and will be continued next year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Members of Parliament Peter White and Kordula Kovac have provided an image on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">In the square yard of the Schwendemann family representatives of the Fischbacher CDU-district met together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann initially gave insights into his farm, in which he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and also many young animals and lodges in five apartments.</seg>
<seg id="72">"" "the" "" "Black Forest" "" "is for him the alternative marketing path for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="73">Only regional areas come to the table of the Feriengaeste.</seg>
<seg id="74">"" "as he is also chairman of the fisherman's bach, he called the" "" "elementary importance" "" "the" "" "spontaneous" "" "project." ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I cannot profitably generate on such steep faces.</seg>
<seg id="76">The green area cares for a lot of work, a lot must be worked on with the brushcutter.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "we have to fight with the conditions and the topography," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003, he took over the parental business and cultivated it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if he did not perform bio-operation.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "for mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear:" "" "the municipality has recognized the importance of the electric fence project and is glad about the leader's support." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">At the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare the farmers would have to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">It is hoped that the afforestation of the land could be pulled out for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the greatest treasure we have are the people who work in agriculture and are thinking about how they continue their operation," "" "said the mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often criticized because of the promotion</seg>
<seg id="84">In 2013, a total of 25 plots were fenced by eleven participants.</seg>
<seg id="85">The area of disclosure is 40 hectares, which should not be forested by at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Half a leader was promoted by the total cost of 71 500 euros, a quarter was driven by the municipality of Fischbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus the farmers remained 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of pasture.</seg>
<seg id="88">"" "" "" "the big advantage is the longevity of the fences," "" "said Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "Kordula Kovac said:" "" "you are doing a really good job, without farmers and farmers." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "Peter White said:" "" "best food is produced here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscape District Courts (LPR) Baden-Wuerttemberg enables the government to promote soft fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is to maintain the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The prerequisite is the presence of a flow rate designated by the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">In addition, the area to be enclosed must not be sluggishable (slope aversion above 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by the reforestation.</seg>
<seg id="95">At the moment, eight participants with 24 plots, which want to build just under 16 kilometres of fence, are currently running for the Fischbacher Weileraunching Project in 2018.</seg>
<seg id="96">The area of disclosure is 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112,000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump is collecting the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The surest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans esteem them as much as any other - hence the carefully orchestrated overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump régime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated argument with Jim Acosta from CNN on the president's proposals for drastic restriction of legal migration to the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To stay fair, Miller didn't handle the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boaters and liberty imitators would have liked him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But it took its significance, and in particular the meaning that it was attributed to, when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to its base.</seg>
<seg id="105">When Miller Acosta wrote: "I don't want to go into a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem you refer to, which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is objectively correct, but as he formulates it himself, it is not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about contemporary resonance on the stirring words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your weary, your poor, and your oppressed masses who desire to breathe freely, and the miserable garbage of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">"" "there was never a time when the" "" "miserable waste" "" "was better seen on our screens." ""</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller did not commit himself to literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation: it is indeed a conflict over the meaning of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they performed a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture was to show the connections between French and American Republicanism by portraying the female embodiment of freedom in a conventional visual representation.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a very different name: mother of the Exilantes.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus has changed the significance of the statue, people from the right wing wanted to change it for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great writer Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anyone but rather an early neo-conservatives that bring the American flame into the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty goes ahead.</seg>
<seg id="119">It is supposed to carry the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">"" "the torch should not light the way to the United States." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual is Limbaugh's encounter with something.</seg>
<seg id="122">The significance of the statue is quite a question of the point of view of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative deed of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted, eleventh, but hopeful people after long and often horrible journeys on the decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the truest sense to see the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Her statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And that is, of course, not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever like to acknowledge.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch should not light the way, but ignite the hatred that is their only source of power.</seg>

<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it's absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Berchart - who are competing against Sir Mon Farah on the 5,000 m circuit, while Eilidh Doyle was chosen by the team captain.</seg>

<seg id="150">The team captain says that they are "extremely proud" of the fact that many of their compatriots are not only part of the team, but in some cases also with medals and finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">"being special about team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was a great honour anyway, but knowing that my teammates voted for me and chose me makes it something special for me," she added.</seg>
<seg id="152">"" "" "" "obviously I'm very proud of all the Scots belonging to the team." ""</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we have come.</seg>
<seg id="154">And they are here as established athletes, athletes, who want to climb on platforms.</seg>
<seg id="155">As for my speech as a captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think she went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back in the Olympic stadium.</seg>

<seg id="160">Block criticisms on Facebook: do not worry about a public office if you cannot tolerate the heating of electors</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something bad news.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the newspapers struck him for everything, from domestic politics to his political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He knocked on the critique, for sure.</seg>

<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan who has to work on being more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked and deleted contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union therefore sued him at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The governor's staff dismissed the suit as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a reaction with "Na," and?. "</seg>
<seg id="170">"it's just Facebook," many people said.</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important if it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a Republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest consent of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary Heat of Heat.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in guiding his state and rigorous adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as primary means to connect with his voters and to play his hairless head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">That is why the blocking of people coming to the Governor's side - which is a public forum that is called official, is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous by employees who are paid with public tax dollars.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans spokeswoman Amelia Chasse advocated the governor's actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too simple to use the image of trolls or spammers or hassertive people who swing online the whip.</seg>
<seg id="181">The mail talked to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are just real people who speak with their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, no trolls.</seg>

<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in earlier times when one had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical corpses or to arrest demonstrators and silence them.</seg>

<seg id="251">After half an hour, the charcoal tuber is taken out with zealous, unwashed hands and swallowed.</seg>

<seg id="273">Papua also has wood resources valued at $78 billion.</seg>
<seg id="274">These riches, however, are a source of misery for the Papua which ensure that Indonesia's powerful military guard a suffocating presence.</seg>
<seg id="275">An analysis of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004 almost $20 million, including up to 150,000 US dollars in one single officer.</seg>

<seg id="299">A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was set fire and things escalated the next day.</seg>
<seg id="300">About 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered at a soccer field in front of the local police station and the Military Command Centre to demand justice.</seg>

<seg id="346">Paniai was always a flashlight for the Indonesian government.</seg>
<seg id="347">The lack of meaningful development strengthens the discontent of the family members Mee, Moni, Dani and damal who live in the green highlands of Papua.</seg>
<seg id="348">Many joined the "Free Papua Movement" (OPM), the rebel army, claiming to defend the rights of the Papua by spurring sporadic attacks and kidnappings by Indonesian soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="349">Some of the top OPM leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.</seg>
<seg id="350">In response to this, thousands of people in Paniai were arrested and arbitrarily arrested in custody, under the pretext of "securing national sovereignty."</seg>
<seg id="351">Some never appear again.</seg>
<seg id="352">Among the people in Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place."</seg>
<seg id="353">Poverty strengthens discontent.</seg>
<seg id="354">The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.</seg>
<seg id="355">Bread is just as out of reach.</seg>
<seg id="356">People here build everything they eat: especially nota and fruit and leafy vegetables.</seg>
<seg id="357">Agriculture is the task of women who can work four or five fields of sweet potatoes.</seg>
<seg id="358">They keep most of the crops for the family, while the rest is sold in the local market.</seg>
<seg id="359">Ten pieces of Nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian Rupiah (75 cents).</seg>
<seg id="360">In the course of time, economic inequalities between the native Papua and the new migrants have grown, which since the opening of new routes to the Nabire airport have arrived in greater numbers.</seg>
<seg id="361">The few jobs that exist in the region are usually addressed to the better educated and affluent migrants.</seg>
<seg id="362">Papua rarely have capital or the necessary skills to make their own companies competitive.</seg>
<seg id="363">"young people are not interested in staying in the village... for there are no jobs or money," says John Gobai, Chairman of the tribal Council of Paniai.</seg>
<seg id="364">Isolation holds the eyes of the world far from Papua.</seg>
<seg id="365">In addition, restrictions on reporting international media remain tense.</seg>
<seg id="366">At the beginning of the year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported for lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua, although they gave them rare permission to film.</seg>
<seg id="367">According to Phelim Kine, Human Rights Watch, Vice-President of Human Rights Watch, the promises of Jokowis's campaign to lift the restrictions of reporting to promote transparency and development were not realized.</seg>
<seg id="368">"there are new dangers to foreign journalists attempting to report from Indonesia's unpeaceful eastern provinces of Papua and Western papua: visa refusal and blacklist," he said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="369">Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely confined to the immediate neighbours of Papua.</seg>
<seg id="370">In March, six pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - asked the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the "different and widespread violations" in Papua including the Paniai shooting.</seg>
<seg id="371">The same countries have historically supported the OPM.</seg>
<seg id="372">The spokesman of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Arrmantha Nasir rejected the accusations of the group and said journalists in Jakarta: "in Indonesia there is still a democratic system, and there are free media, so it is difficult to cover the evidence for human rights cases."</seg>
<seg id="373">The local people want more foreign governments to take note of this.</seg>
<seg id="374">When an official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by Kees Van Baar, Jayapura, visited Jayapura on 4 May, locals broke their silence and urged him "We want freedom," according to a source that also participated in the meeting, but would like to remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="375">Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the Papua would probably not vote for Jokowi again.</seg>
<seg id="376">"Jokowi is a man who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Paniai shots," said Gobai, Chairman of the tribal Council.</seg>
<seg id="377">He wants the Paniai people to know that the Paniai people, apart from the fact that it lives under the constant threat of a predatory military, is in poor educational and health services.</seg>
<seg id="378">"" "in Mumbai, the Paniai people, like other Papua, consider their voice for Jokowi as a" "" "guilt" "" "he has to pay back." ""</seg>
<seg id="379">"they don't need money, they just want justice," he says.</seg>
<seg id="380">Despite the threats and intimidations, the families of the Paniai fire victims led to the last symbolic act of defiance: the body of a victim was buried on a site exactly opposite the police and the military station.</seg>
<seg id="381">They know they will never give them justice, but at least they do not let those responsible forget their crimes.</seg>

<seg id="408">Less than 1 per cent said they had belated discovered that they had gone wrong with firearms, ammunition or explosives.</seg>
<seg id="409">The survey conducted for more than 1,000 people, carried out by a jet charter service, the Stratos Jet Charters Inc., also noted that younger travellers are more likely to ignore the rules.</seg>
<seg id="410">Of the respondents who admitted that they knowingly tried to fly with something prohibited by the TSA, 19.7 percent of millennials, compared to less than 15 percent, were members of Generation X.</seg>
<seg id="411">The most common items that have been deliberately passed by TSA agents were food and liquids.</seg>
<seg id="412">More than 3 per cent said, knowingly having carried items with blades by security control, while 2.2 percent of the female respondents and 3.7 percent of the male respondents also confirmed that they had deliberately forbidden drugs in the plane.</seg>
<seg id="413">The company said it asked travelers throughout the country to find out how many accidentally smuggled goods had been brought about by airport security and how many people had intentionally done it.</seg>
<seg id="414">It is no surprise that people who are most likely smugglers - knowingly or unknowingly - wear safety, those who fly most often.</seg>
<seg id="415">However, the company insists that the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.</seg>
<seg id="416">People are often uncertain about which fluids they may take or how much of it.</seg>

<seg id="424">Over the past few months, Musk has often had more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, whose delivery begins.</seg>

<seg id="428">Currently 45,000 such non-binding reservations are being presented, Musk admitted in a telephone conference with analysts.</seg>
<seg id="429">The Tesla boss does not believe that the cancellation of up to twelve percent of all orders could become a problem.</seg>
<seg id="430">His argument: the challenge with ambitious growth targets is not in demand, but on the production side.</seg>

<seg id="433">The demand for this is obvious.</seg>
<seg id="434">According to Musk, 1800 online reservations are made.</seg>
<seg id="435">Anyone who orders a "Model 3" can expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - when Tesla manages to drive his brand-new production lines tested never before in practice without any major disruptions with maximum capacity utilization.</seg>
<seg id="436">Many experts doubt that this is possible.</seg>
<seg id="437">However, if it comes to larger delays, the non-binding of reservations could become a problem for Tesla.</seg>

<seg id="466">"" "750 Years of the Church of St. Hilarius: on the occasion of the anniversary of the" "" "Bergkirche" "", "the old cemetery area in Tumlingen will be invited to a serenade on Sunday, July 16, at 4.30 pm." ""</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius facility is a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">Visitors to the sixth Benefiz serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in town have made friends and promoters of tumours their concern.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini emphasises: "it is a unique village gem."</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267 the Chapel of St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in documents: Graf Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church of Tumlingen and the Vogtei" at the Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">In addition to the former parish church, the wording of the document, besides the former parish church, was also a stately courtyard, to which the church or the patronate law belonged, not the other way round.</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were also people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">As from the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt dating from 1858, apart from the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still visible today in the village of Tumlingen, the "mountain" is the third, the most beautiful settlement core of the village.</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps from the period around 1600 substantiate these historical circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="476">The right to patronate arose from the early medieval church law.</seg>
<seg id="477">A master who built a church, furnished and occupied with a priest remained the owner of this church and could also bequeathed this church.</seg>
<seg id="478">Associated with this was the right to use a priest or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The Larger of the two tore up at Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly acquired bell sounded for the first time in 1692, but had to be handed over later during World War II in 1942.</seg>
<seg id="482">During the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648) the windows were hammered and the bell parts were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaking.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796, French troops camped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">The remains of the church were threatened in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869 the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery also served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was enlarged and the Church of Hilarion stopped.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the bell tower was left.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year's Night in 1834 a storm broke down the steeple and half collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="491">To prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the tower still existing today survived as a witness of the 750-year-old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">Today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem maintain the Hilarius plant as successor of Dieter Dockhorn.</seg>
<seg id="494">As organizers, the friends and promoters of Tumlin invite to the sixth serenade to the St. Hilariuskapelle cemetery on Sunday, July 16, at the sixth serenade.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is organised by the Combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with contributions by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.</seg>
<seg id="496">The local leader Hartmut Romann speaks the final word.</seg>
<seg id="497">The program starts at 4.30 pm.</seg>
<seg id="498">Admission is starting at 3: 30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="499">To conclude the serenade, a trunk will take place in front of the cemetery.</seg>
<seg id="500">"" "" "" "enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows towards the forest," "" "the organisers take out the fantastic view." ""</seg>
<seg id="501">The Serenade takes place only in dry weather.</seg>
<seg id="502">The organizers are hoping for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hilarius facility, which is of importance for Tumlings and Hörschweiler.</seg>
<seg id="503">The friends and promoters of Tumour are particularly committed to their home care, as Serenade organiser Walter Martini reiterates.</seg>

<seg id="505">"Boisheim wears himself" does not see any legal precondition for the construction and has therefore turned to the councilor.</seg>

<seg id="507">It was illegal.</seg>
<seg id="508">The association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Boisheim Nette no wind turbines could have been approved, as at the time in Viersen only at the city border to Schwalmtal there exists a wind power concentration zone.</seg>
<seg id="509">In this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes exclusion of wind energy utilization for the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="510">"" "such zones should prevent" "" "sparing" "" "of the landscape." ""</seg>

<seg id="520">The NEW Re, a subsidiary of NEW, plans to build four hundred meters high wind turbines on an area at the Boisheim Nette.</seg>
<seg id="521">Last year, the company, in which the city Viersen is indirectly involved, had signed lease contracts with the owner of approximately 65 hectares of land.</seg>
<seg id="522">With the establishment of the four wind turbines, the power requirement of around 11 400 households is to be covered - this corresponds to about a fifth of the power requirement of all four-person households.</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">Last summer, Viersen City Council gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines at the Linnich wind farm near Aachen and a stake in a wind turbine in Übach-Palenberg in the Kreis Heinsberg district.</seg>

<seg id="681">Max amount works as a volunteer</seg>
<seg id="682">They work at several locations in their voluntary year.</seg>
<seg id="683">Where anywhere?</seg>
<seg id="684">Quantity: usually in ford in the furniture exchange, once a week I am here in Greven in the furniture bridge.</seg>
<seg id="685">And I have also worked on the school as an open day.</seg>
<seg id="686">What are your experiences with this?</seg>
<seg id="687">Quantity: it's a beautiful, wide spectrum that I see here.</seg>
<seg id="688">I have to do with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.</seg>
<seg id="689">They are now 26 years, so a late-time volunteer.</seg>
<seg id="690">How does that come about?</seg>
<seg id="691">Amount: I graduated from SLC.</seg>
<seg id="692">And then a civil engineer, let's say, successfully broken off.</seg>
<seg id="693">I know for myself that it is the wrong for me and I want to do something else, work with people.</seg>
<seg id="694">And then I asked myself what are you doing.</seg>
<seg id="695">Get a social year, there's an insight, you can see how it is on site, at the focal point maybe, really.</seg>
<seg id="696">And was it like that?</seg>
<seg id="697">Amount: I collected great impressions.</seg>
<seg id="698">I will start my studies in the social system in the winter semester.</seg>
<seg id="699">I will study dual, probably in the Jugendamt Herne a social worker training and study in Hamm at the university of applied sciences.</seg>
<seg id="700">Is it not unusual to have several different locations during the volunteer service?</seg>
<seg id="701">Quantity: yes, it is very variable.</seg>
<seg id="702">It always depends where you make your FSJ.</seg>
<seg id="703">It can be done from the old people's home to youth work - in all facets of social work.</seg>
<seg id="704">With me it was very varied.</seg>
<seg id="705">I was also partly in the OGS, so in the afternoon care.</seg>
<seg id="706">For me it was just the right thing that provoked me.</seg>
<seg id="707">I could see my own strengths and see how it really works.</seg>
<seg id="708">Other than in Civil Engineering?</seg>
<seg id="709">A lot: well, here it's not about calculating Statiks.</seg>
<seg id="710">One always has other people in front of the head, each having a very different story behind them.</seg>
<seg id="711">Whether a refugee or a teenager who has been taken out of the family - you must always take an individual look at it.</seg>
<seg id="712">Very interesting.</seg>
<seg id="713">And you had no reservations at all?</seg>
<seg id="714">Amount: I'm not the guy.</seg>
<seg id="715">It is an area that gives a lot.</seg>
<seg id="716">Lots of love, great kindness.</seg>

<seg id="748">At the end, the decision was clear: at two counterparts, the municipal council of Fluorn-Wintzels decided to set up a common room in the future retirement home.</seg>
<seg id="749">Prior to the discussion there is an important information: the purchase contract for the still lacking development part is signed, mayor Bernhard Tjades reports.</seg>

<seg id="758">The setting up of a common room would be, as reported by Tjades, by 60 percent of 30 percent.</seg>
<seg id="759">The proposal looks to signal the investor that in this respect you don't want to discard any billets between the legs, the statement that both saddle - which is leaning against the surrounding buildings - as well as pent roof - which reduces the height and makes the construction more economical - would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="760">Needless to say, Wilfried Sohmer writes, is this addition.</seg>
<seg id="761">When it helps: it happens unanimously by the body.</seg>

<seg id="904">The work on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is proceeding well.</seg>
<seg id="905">On Wednesday, a seven-tonne concrete part was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.</seg>

<seg id="907">In April, work began at the same time on all three refurbishment bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="908">The building is scheduled for October and Leicht is sure that the schedule will be respected.</seg>
<seg id="909">The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads across the Trombach.</seg>
<seg id="910">It is a concrete arch bridge made of concrete, which is covered with red Buntsandstein and has a total length of 4.80 meters.</seg>
<seg id="911">It was built in 1900.</seg>
<seg id="912">Like the other two bridges, it has now come into the years.</seg>
<seg id="913">In order to ensure stability and road safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly refurbished.</seg>
<seg id="914">The other two bridges lead over the Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="915">They are made of red colored Buntsandstein.</seg>
<seg id="916">Both were erected in 1939 and are twelve, respectively 10,60 metres long.</seg>
<seg id="917">The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach on Wednesday morning on the northern side has a 1.30 metre wide and seven ton heavy so-called bridge cap.</seg>
<seg id="918">This is a side fastener that is also used as operating mode.</seg>
<seg id="919">A 2.20 meter wide bridge cap is to be used on the southern part of the bridge on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="920">Then the pedestrian walkway should be gone.</seg>
<seg id="921">The special thing about this is that they are finished parts, a patent by the Schramberger company Dizwo.</seg>
<seg id="922">The other two bridges have already been fitted with the patented bridged caps.</seg>
<seg id="923">Special tact feeling has required the laying of cables through the building in Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="924">This is because there is also a fibre-optic cable that many companies are connected to.</seg>
<seg id="925">The residents were informed about the project in advance of the work.</seg>
<seg id="926">Fish and crayfish had to be fished first.</seg>
<seg id="927">For the bridges between the building yard and the collecting point in the direction of Schramberg, traffic is one-lane regulated by a traffic light.</seg>
<seg id="928">For the construction work on the bridge at the Lauterbach town entrance, the street in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotel "Tannenhof" and "Sieben Linden" is fully closed.</seg>
<seg id="929">The cost of the three parts of the bridge amounts to 700,000 euros.</seg>

<seg id="933">The parties represented in the district of Vulkaneifel (CDU, SPD, Greens, FDP, FWG, left) are part of a wide alliance that shows a peaceful flag on this day because the AfD in the Gerolsteiner Stadthalle, Rondell, invites to the "big election campaign" according to the poster.</seg>
<seg id="934">And well-known names start - like Alice Weidel, who together with Alexander Gauland forms the leading duo for the Bundestag election on September 24, and the deputy chairman Beatrix of Storch.</seg>
<seg id="935">But those who are on the spot for hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the AfD-lern, but rather demonstrate.</seg>
<seg id="936">The motto "The Eifel remains colorful."</seg>
<seg id="937">Originally planned was the city picnic under the motto "All at a table" on the well ground, but now takes place on the parking lot underneath the Rondelles - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the AfD event in the Stadthalle.</seg>
<seg id="938">A colourful picture that offers itself.</seg>

<seg id="942">How did the AfD actually come to Gerolstein?</seg>
<seg id="943">Mario Hompes of the AfD Vulkaneifel reports that he strives for such an event and got the supplement.</seg>
<seg id="944">The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had asked in Daun initially, but there was a cancellation because there were not enough parking spaces due to the built-in Laurentiuskirchen.</seg>

<seg id="947">This is also true: at 20 o'clock on the Rondellplatz a band provides entertainment, in the Stadthalle diverse speakers, among them the rheinland pfälzischen AfD-chairman Uwe Jung.</seg>
<seg id="948">In the hall there are about 200 listeners waiting for the top candidate to vote for the Bundestag election, Alice Weidel, and the deputy chairman Beatrix of Storch.</seg>
<seg id="949">The police presence remains unchanged, but until now, the officials had a quiet evening.</seg>
<seg id="950">A little more than an hour is the AfD event, the guests on the forecourt have a longer breath, but also there is announced shortly after 21 o'clock.</seg>

<seg id="1125">Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to extract the Brazilian from its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary which will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars move to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can certainly make the money loose, so that Neymar is signing and bringing it into a galaxy of other stars, in view of the financing of the team by the powerful host family of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Associations are allowed to spend a lot of money on the acquisition of players, but they have to fight with legitimate sources of income that allow them to break even point in their business-related business.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election as the UEFA President in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that clubs, who had taken enormous debts in their pursuit of success, effectively cheated and risked to ruin when banks or owners withdrew their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011 FFP moved from concentrating on the debt of clubs to monitoring their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder business.</seg>
<seg id="1133">During the current three-year period of the FFP period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses amounting to EUR 30 million.</seg>
<seg id="1134">And although Platini fell in favor by the presidency in 2015, its successor, Aleksander Ceferin, continues to scare away from excessive spending.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"" "" "" "surely FFP is not dead and we will certainly reinforce the rules for the future," "" "said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, opposite The Associated Press last week." ""</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a flat rate, it can distribute the amount for invoicing over the duration of its contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so that the redemption payments for the next five years can be accounted for by 44.4 million euros in the annual financial statements.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 took the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the toughest sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">The PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (then $82 million), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.</seg>
<seg id="1140">UEFA is looking for clubs that might attempt to outwit their financial supervision by inflating their income by companies associated with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a Catalan company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsoring should exceed the standard market rates, UEFA would not be considered legitimate incomes.</seg>
<seg id="1142">This is exactly what happened in 2014, when the UEFA decided that the PSA sponsorship was leaned by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that a part of PSG payments could come to Neymar about payments by the Organizing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar 2022 have argued that Neymar will become World Cup ambassadors and could easily find out such a maneuver for UEFA regulators.</seg>
<seg id="1145">"" "" "" "the previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be more attentive to any attempt to circumvent the rules." ""</seg>
<seg id="1146">UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymars Transfer, announcing on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1147">They spoke on the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, as they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The latest published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 generated a profit of more than €10 million with a turnover of 542.4 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="1149">The accounts for the last financial year are still to be published.</seg>
<seg id="1150">PSG expected Neymars arrival is a blessing for sponsoring deals, merchandising and tricot sales.</seg>
<seg id="1151">The association expects sales to rise by at least 30 percent after the signing.</seg>
<seg id="1152">The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players going and she tried to prevent Neymars away by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.</seg>
<seg id="1153">"" "" "" "it is a clear case of" "" "financial doping" "" "with the Club and the State," "" "said the President of the La League, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS with regard to Qatar's last ownership of PSG." ""</seg>

<seg id="1158">Swiss is looking for a new Schoggisupplier</seg>
<seg id="1159">In recent years, Chocolat Frey has made board chocolate for Swiss.</seg>

<seg id="1168">But more important is the advertising effect: it is a prestigious order for a chimney manufacturer.</seg>
<seg id="1169">Swiss does not want to betray how many applicants will find it in the new tender.</seg>
<seg id="1170">But there are only Swiss manufacturers in question.</seg>

<seg id="1183">Nostalgia goes to "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective" into the niche</seg>
<seg id="1184">This repetition of history is at the same time nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 "s, for the 90-year Grunge era (when the pioneers David Wain and Michael Showalter chose the Sketch-comedy" The State "for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd, went to greater things.</seg>
<seg id="1185">As a cultural artefact, it is equally a parody and embodiment of our Facebook-capable era of permanent memories.</seg>
<seg id="1186">But as a franchise it feels like time is short.</seg>
<seg id="1187">"first Day of Camp" was surprisingly good, not just because of its absurd humour (it contained an original story for a talking Dose vegetable that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).</seg>
<seg id="1188">Raising herself on the core of the gag - middle-aged actors playing horny children who grow up - nevertheless they managed to regain the impossibility of regaining the last part of the wit.</seg>
<seg id="1189">"ten Years Later," with his adults, who now play adults, is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes more to the watering principle, including a riff on the Stalker films of the 90's like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle."</seg>
<seg id="1190">"" "at one point, a character rumbles through an Apple-Powerbook, some inline skates and" "" "a number of other things from 1991." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1191">Many of the central stories are the same.</seg>
<seg id="1192">The gracious Coop (Mr. Showalter), now Romanautor, has never forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn't lost his virginity.</seg>
<seg id="1194">And there is another crazy evil Plot, included in Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) who is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a good successful impression of Michael Ian Black).</seg>
<seg id="1195">As always, the expositions are the best part of franchise.</seg>
<seg id="1196">It's a lot of fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillons's underside beard of "singles," whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy feels like an old cracker.</seg>
<seg id="1197">It's the moments of accidental madness that could heat this franchise as a sort of repetitive "Seven Up!" series, until he achieves what I consider as his logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose final scene will show the band how to visit the film premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer."</seg>
<seg id="1198">In the meantime, "Comrade Detective" on Amazon reminds us of a different kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War from "The Americans," to the film "Atomic Blonde," and even "GLOW" with its East-West Ringstruggle Iconography.</seg>
<seg id="1199">The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, with Rhys Thomas, is the director of a bound TV series: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest, who fight for truth, atheism and the way of Marxism-Leninism.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The main roles - a hard-boiled Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu ulici whose dialogues of Channing Tatum (also a detailed producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt are synchronized in English.</seg>
<seg id="1201">It is an ingenious idea.</seg>
<seg id="1202">But it is not much more than an idea.</seg>
<seg id="1203">There are some nice flags to watch (the police spends time watching chess on television, as Americans might do with football).</seg>
<seg id="1204">And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny - ensures a decent play 'Finde the voice out'.</seg>
<seg id="1205">But "Comrade Detective" is so much involved in the truthfulness of a despairing propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like a single.</seg>
<seg id="1206">With six long episodes, it moves away, and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough.</seg>
<seg id="1207">"Comrade Detective," who was reduced to a lower length, could better deliver his agitprop satire, since Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the American embassy whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who devour a pile of hamburgers.</seg>
<seg id="1208">The message for the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can do everything to feed for a money.</seg>
<seg id="1209">The fictitious romanian creators were not wrong: we even do it with our own recent history and with theirs.</seg>
<seg id="1210">Strike against drug mafia in the country</seg>
<seg id="1211">The police succeeded in a blow against the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg.</seg>
<seg id="1212">On Wednesday morning, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, numerous objects were searched, as the public prosecutor Constance announced on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="1213">At the same time, 15 accused were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and already issued arrest warrants against them.</seg>
<seg id="1214">In addition, the officials made large amounts of marijuana and cocaine, firearms and several hundred thousand euros safe.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Two persons were arrested at the same time in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="1216">Against the two suspects of Italy there were German arrest warrants.</seg>
<seg id="1217">The two are probably extradited to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action.</seg>
<seg id="1219">A total of more than 300 policemen were in use.</seg>
<seg id="1220">The mafia's members are accused of organized drug criminality, violent acts of violence, attempted murder as well as robbery and blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Since summer 2016, the public prosecutor's office has been investigating opposition to organised drug trafficking in Southern Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Between the prosecutors in Constance and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investigators of the Cripo Rottweil had close contact with their colleagues in Sicily.</seg>
<seg id="1223">Therefore, on Wednesday morning, large-scale deployment was accompanied by four officers from Palermo.</seg>
<seg id="1224">The investigations included mainly Italian nationals with close relation to the Italian mafia.</seg>
<seg id="1225">A incident on May 27 in Hüfingen, where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning, is likely to go to the bank account.</seg>

<seg id="1231">According to the data, ten million people with foreign citizenship are reported in the register, including 5,7 million from non-EU countries.</seg>
<seg id="1232">The data is therefore administered by approximately 600 country nationals in Germany.</seg>

<seg id="1238">Meanwhile, the Federal Government has apparently begun sending refugee families back to Italy with under 16 years of age when they entered the country.</seg>
<seg id="1239">This comes from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung."</seg>

<seg id="1317">Living the big life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Earls Court apartment into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a real estate passion, moved from a large house in Knightsbridge to Earls Court Apartment in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant queen Anne terrace - and it's a proof of the new design that Joanne did not pack her bags and sold them.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," says Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"I searched for something comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and it had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"" "I fell in love with her and made an offer this day." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot has been completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one bedroom property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted storage space and an mezzanine level to make optimal use of the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.</seg>
<seg id="1327">That was my requirement, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose she commissioned the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12,5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other, so the architectonic challenge was to create an intermediate floor in which one could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively to solve the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel work is quite complicated," he explains.</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "we had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked on top of each other without having to bend down." ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">"" "it was not just about building a simple platform, but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement made it possible for Erfan to place two rooms at full height - with a lot of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine, a classic copper light window from Retrouvius looks down through the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage serge moull lighting set the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in the addition of theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">At both ends a short corridor is mirrored to let it work longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen, the mirror feels like a window into another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all the cutlery and glasses of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">Through the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Folding kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"" "" "" "a bit of engineering plastics went inside," "" "explains Erfan, by the steel reinforced, veneered MDF door." ""</seg>
<seg id="1345">"" "" "" "it is very important, so it's very easy if you push the door." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space Joanne could gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"" "" "" "at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is appreciated," "" "says Erfan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1348">"" "" "" "in a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the soil size." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they have managed to enlarge the floor space and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"" "" "" "the materials are the things that touch you and which will help create emotional ties in a home," "" "says Erfan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "" "" "you don't love the electrical outlets in the walls." ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">These are important, but they don't play with your heart. "</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square footage of something standard in something quite amazing.</seg>
<seg id="1354">In fact, like Joanne, you could decide not to leave this.</seg>
<seg id="1355">Brothers are fighting for $500 million real estate empire</seg>
<seg id="1356">Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in a struggle for one of the largest real estate imperial Victorias worth over $500 million.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The former director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and designer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors from his younger brother Paul. he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their assets are to be divided.</seg>
<seg id="1358">Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014, but a sharp debate on the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Together with her mother Anna, the brothers acquired 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, accumulated since the family purchased a store at Smith Street, Collingwood in 1973.</seg>
<seg id="1360">There the Westco jeans founded and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores.</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1362">This money has been invested in real estate, and De Lutis portfolio now includes offices in the city center, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping malls in the suburbs.</seg>
<seg id="1363">According to an agreement with her late father, Colin - described by Paul as the "main operator and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one third.</seg>
<seg id="1364">A court file says that this means that Colin owns $316 million and Paul has a value of 176 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be problematic for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"" "" "" "the divisions proposed by Colin have left him with what I thought for the best objects," "" "he wrote in a first Affidavit in 2015." ""</seg>
<seg id="1367">Last Friday, after several failed negotiations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place.</seg>
<seg id="1368">The Brothers now also struggle for control over the existing business - from which Colin, like Paul claims to have excluded it.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Colin argues that this is not true, but accuses Paul to incompetently manage some possessions.</seg>
<seg id="1370">In an early Affidavit submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="1371">"" "" "" "my Italian heritage dictates that the family is the most important priority," "" "he wrote." ""</seg>
<seg id="1372">The cost increases in the event of hundreds of pages with affidavits, emails and reports from companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and both parties.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delicatessens from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early seventies.</seg>
<seg id="1374">They used the security to buy the Collingwood property in which Colin opened the first jeans shop of the family.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Colin says that he started Westco when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a small child (about 10 years old)."</seg>
<seg id="1376">Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to share their property with their sons.</seg>
<seg id="1377">"" "" "" "Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land before judgment," "" "she wrote." ""</seg>
<seg id="1378">Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies, whereas Colin claims that Mark has paid $10 million in the abandonment of the company and Luke 26 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1379">"" "both Luke and Mark were," "" "said Paul," "" "had become bitter about the conditions of their financial separation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1380">Colin withheld himself very much, although he was a former AFL member and after a biography of 2015 by Eddie McGuire the best friend of the TV star.</seg>
<seg id="1381">Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1382">"" "only Colin answered by SMS, to say" "" "I really can't say much," "" "because the case is in front of the courts." ""</seg>

<seg id="1388">Trumps of new Chief of Staff is planning to restrict the president's media abstinence.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Politico reported that the White House Chief of Staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump, including news media reports - hoping to hold the boss on a more constant course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with senior employees on his first working day, he posed a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House that he wanted to repair: bad information that comes into the hands of the President.</seg>
<seg id="1395">"" "Kelly told the staff that information should flow on him - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumps's relationship with television dates back decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"" "" "" "if candidate Trump was angry because of unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of jobs that were to be persuaded," "" "said the former election campaign consultant Sam Nunberg in February to Politico." ""</seg>
<seg id="1399">"" "Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that" "" "the key to keep Trumps Twitter's habit under control, according to six former election campaigns, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps's Twitter habit was ever "under control" is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Maybe these campaign officials don't know what we don't know about others - that Trumps Tweets would have included more fuel without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about tweets that Trump has not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his staff managed to keep trouble away from him several times, their efforts paid off.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently been able to prevent drunky controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">Part of the problem is that people in a White House, which is composed of competing parties, always try to present their own agenda by presenting Trump Material that potentially promotes their views of the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Politico - busy with this story - reported in May about the predilection of advisers to bring doubtful information to the president for strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press clippings, especially those with damaged leaks, and that he tries to find out where they originate from.</seg>
<seg id="1410">This was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone accused the President of a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh, "to be the source behind a heap of leaks" in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson has been permanently banned from Twitter for chicane, or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has expressed false allegations in the past and has revoked them.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and started asking employees about Walsh. "</seg>
<seg id="1413">Goldsmith added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter, "tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove to be more effective than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisers are still striving for influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">These immutable factors make Kellys mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1449">In the fall of 2014, in view of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees who came to the district, the hotel building was offered to the Regional Office as a collective housing, which provided controversial discussions.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the placing of asylum seekers by the establishment of a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">The decision was not undisputed at that time in the Municipal Council.</seg>

<seg id="1479">Russia Affair: us Special Issuer sets up Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">In the Russian affair around US President Donald Trump, special issuer Robert Mueller allegedly appointed a so-called Grand Jury after a report.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"" "in recent weeks, the body has taken up work, wrote the Wall Street Journal, calling on people familiar with the matter." ""</seg>
<seg id="1482">The paper took the step as a sign that Mueller had widened and intensified his investigations.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The station CNN reported that there are already initial charges of the committee in connection with a meeting between Trumps of the oldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">U.S. intelligence agencies have been accusing the Kremlin for a long time to have purposefully intervened in the presidential campaign in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller investigated whether there were agreements between Trumps election campaign team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">In the focus of the investigation, several men were to stand who acted as advisers to the Republicans in the election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1487">According to reports, Mueller took a closer look at more and more trumps in a private and business environment.</seg>
<seg id="1488">A few weeks ago, the "Washington Post" wrote that the special issuer Trump personally moved to the centre and undertook the accusation whether the president could possibly obstruct the judiciary.</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Jury is to examine present evidence in possible crime cases and decide whether to be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand Juries are therefore also called anchor chains.</seg>
<seg id="1491">Most of the time they are switched on if they are larger and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always carried out behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The Panel can also be turned on by the public prosecutor to invite people to interrogation under oath.</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to the broadcaster CNN, invitations have already been issued which revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">People who were involved in the meeting were called upon to testify, it was said in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">They should also provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">In addition to Trump Jr., Trumps was also a consultant and son-in-law Jared Kushner as well as his senior election campaign director Paul Manafort during the conversation.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Legal experts stated on Thursday evening on US television that the setting show that Mueller would not intimidate himself in his work and that if necessary, he wanted to act quickly.</seg>
<seg id="1499">But it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the charging of an accusation.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Nevertheless, the establishment of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause of concern for President Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1501">In the midst of the new revelations, on Thursday evening, the president used a speech in West Virginia to portray the Russia affair as a campaign of its political opponents.</seg>
<seg id="1502">"Russia history is a total invention," said Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1503">"" "the subject gives democrats a way to" "" "feel good" "" "because they have nothing else to talk about." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1504">His Special Advisor Ty Cobb stated in a statement that he did not know anything about setting up a Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1505">But they usually work secretly, he stressed.</seg>
<seg id="1506">"" "the White House supports any action that accelerated the work of the special agent in a" "" "fair" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1507">"" "" "" "the former FBI chief James Comey said three times that not against the president." ""</seg>
<seg id="1508">I have no reason to assume that something has changed, it was stated in the explanation.</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller had only been used after Trump Comey had fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"" "" "" "because of this root, accusations against Trump have become loud; he wanted to hinder the judiciary." ""</seg>
<seg id="1511">Comey said in June before a Senate Committee, Trump asked him to set up the investigation against the national security adviser Michael Flynn.</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Following the presentation of US media, the White House collected material against the special issuer and its employees.</seg>
<seg id="1514">This triggered speculation as to whether Trump Mueller wanted to dismiss.</seg>
<seg id="1515">Unlike an independent investigator of the Congress, such as in the Watergate affair around the later retired President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired up by the President of the Ministry of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="1516">Several Senators of both parties want to prevent such a move.</seg>
<seg id="1517">Two groups of Republican and Democratic senators presented the bill on Thursday that the special issuer could not be dismissed as easily as possible.</seg>
<seg id="1518">Antarctica: giant iceberg advances in Antarctica</seg>
<seg id="1519">In the western Antarctic, a gigantic iceberg of the almost seven-fold size of Berlin from the Schelfeis has solved itself.</seg>
<seg id="1520">This was announced by the Bremerhavener Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">The colossus, which weighs over a trillion tons and 5800 square kilometres, is now driving to the north and will probably need two or three years until it has melted.</seg>
<seg id="1522">With 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the biggest ice giants that researchers have registered over the past three decades.</seg>
<seg id="1523">A danger for human beings does not emanate from him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">The extent to which climate change has played a role in the demolition of the iceberg is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1525">In total, however, there has been a series of unusual breakthroughs in the region for around 30 years, writes the US Research Center for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) in a fact background.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now broken colossus was previously a part of the Larsen-C-Schelfeis.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelfeis floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It therefore continues to grow into the sea and breaks out regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the head of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">North of this Schelfeises was disturbed by the balance of waxes and breaks some years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">A complete Schelfeis is discarded there, writes AWI-researcher Daniela Jansen.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There is some evidence that the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is in danger, because the front edge has never been withdrawn as far as it is currently.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the iron plate is under tension and can fall apart if a piece is broken down at a key point.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Melting of Schelfeis and Eisberg does not increase sea level because they float on the water and ice as much water as it flows after melting.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the ice shelf leads to that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase sea level, however only to a small extent, writes the British research project to observe Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">According to AWI, the Larsen-C Schelfeis is the fourth largest ice shelf in Antarctica with nearly 50 000 square kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="1539">At the crossing from the mainland, it is up to 700 metres thick, at the front edge to the free ocean some 200 meters.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks out regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural phenomenon and is not aware of any direct link to climate change, the ice shield comes into a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary of British Swansea University.</seg>
<seg id="1542">"" "" "" "this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the records," "" "he affirmed." ""</seg>
<seg id="1543">Among scientists, it is disputed whether the Larsen-C Schelfeis will now grow back or come back in the long term and possibly coincide, said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added: "our models say that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will last decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even though these researchers do not lead the demolition of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, many ice-snuffs of the Antarctic Peninsula have fallen apart in recent decades.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long tip of Antarctica extends towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to the British Antarctic Survey research programme, the Antarctic Survey has declined 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The increase in temperature has contributed to the decrease.</seg>
<seg id="1549">The Antarctic Peninsula has been heated around three degrees in the past 50 years and therefore number in the areas where the temperature increases the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="1550">CDU wants Haustarif at the staff</seg>
<seg id="1551">Because it becomes increasingly difficult to occupy vacant positions, the CDU calls on the employers' association to become more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Just before the summer break, the chalkday 41 places new jobs in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1553">More than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Now 17 apprentices have their first working day behind.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The apprentices at the circle are obviously very sought-after.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Around 620 applications were recorded for the places that were to be published this year.</seg>
<seg id="1557">Nevertheless, the circle continues to lack staff in order to cope with the increased demands and tasks.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Currently there are still 50 non-occupied places in the district of Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1559">We are looking for doctors and engineers, as well as general management forces.</seg>
<seg id="1560">The CDU now wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1561">"" "the administration should develop a concept for personnel recruitment and personnel development according to the wishes of the parties." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1562">The aim is not only to meet short-term demands for skilled workers, but to counteract the future-oriented approach of applicants.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The overall concept should orientate inward and outwards, show concrete measures for cross-entrants and include an education campaign, demand CDU, FDP and UWG.</seg>
<seg id="1564">That sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to do with personal problems that you didn't know before.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities recruit good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">"" "we are talking about a" "" "competition of public employers" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1568">This requires a large number of employees who leave the service for disease or age reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1569">So high time for action so that even more places remain unoccupied.</seg>
<seg id="1570">But Klaus-Dieter Völker, leader of the CDU, goes beyond the common application with his party.</seg>
<seg id="1571">He took care of a fist-thick surprise even in the day of the circle, when he publicly challenged the staffing of staff and struck the rest of the parties.</seg>
<seg id="1572">"" "" "" "people want all possibilities to be checked, which allow an exit from the municipal employers' association." ""</seg>
<seg id="1573">"" "" "" "if we do not come to a satisfying solution at short notice, the district administration should strive for a house tariff in cooperation with the county-affiliated towns," "" "says Peoples." ""</seg>
<seg id="1574">Thus the CDU, the employees and officials are trying to pay better than it actually foresees the tariff statement for the Public Service.</seg>
<seg id="1575">The salaries are currently exactly dictated, increases or more money is only available if you switch to a higher level that is oriented towards career years.</seg>
<seg id="1576">But the tasks of the circle grew more and more in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="1577">Only a few weeks ago, new rooms had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new prostitution protection law.</seg>

<seg id="1582">Minnitis warning came a day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat of the German auxiliary organisation 'Youth Rettet' because their team had worked effectively with human traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="1583">The relief organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to express detailed allegations of the Italian Ambrogio Cartosio prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1584">"for us, the saving of human life is our top priority. so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," said the organization in a statement on the social media.</seg>
<seg id="1585">"" "" "" "we can only judge all accusations currently raised after we have collected all the information and assess the situation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1586">The Italian authorities had supervised the boat from 'Youth Rettet', the Iuventa, since October.</seg>
<seg id="1587">It is thought that its crew takes dinghy migrants aboard, which will be delivered to them directly by human traffickers, and that the smugglers can depart so that the ships can be used again.</seg>
<seg id="1588">At least one such meeting took place only 1,3 miles in front of the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's file, whose content was published by Italian media.</seg>
<seg id="1589">The occupation is suspected of being overthrown by the authority of the Italian Coastguard, the rescue missions in the area for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Under the Code of Conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must first of all have an Italian police officer who monitors their activities.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far been prepared to adhere to the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.</seg>

<seg id="1594">Minniti has now said that the number of migrants arriving in Italy after the rescue measures has declined sharply in recent weeks, which indicates that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguard and co-operation with the local mayors have borne fruit.</seg>
<seg id="1595">"" "" "" "in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," "" "said the Minister." ""</seg>

<seg id="1597">Ascents and Trials</seg>
<seg id="1598">Nine female bikers, the "Berlin outpost" and two guest drivers met at Wachenheim in the northern Palatinate to enjoy Trials and sights for four days.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Three friendly guides were available for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The accommodation in the Wachenheimer Tal proved to be a good starting point for the tours.</seg>

<seg id="1603">Lookout points followed, partly on towers, of which one could look far above the Pfälzer Wald and the upstream plains.</seg>
<seg id="1604">In between there were always longer ascents, for which long trials rewarded.</seg>

<seg id="1612">Console instead of lawn - Bundesliga tooling for e-sport</seg>
<seg id="1613">Are the sports stars sitting in front of computer consoles in the future, rather than competing in wind and weather across the stadium rasps?</seg>
<seg id="1614">The fact is: e-sport has long become a serious business, a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gages included.</seg>
<seg id="1615">These have also recognized the first Bundesliga clubs, which are increasingly engaged in this field.</seg>
<seg id="1616">The beginning of 2015 was the VfL Wolfsburg, later the FC Schalke 04 and finally the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an e-sport department in mid-July and took two pros for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract.</seg>
<seg id="1617">"" "" "" "we hope to inspire all new young target groups for the VfB," "" "says CEO Jochen Röttger." ""</seg>
<seg id="1618">"" "he is sure," "" "Some clubs are still rising on this train." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1619">Next weekend, FIFA World Cup in London organizes the first "Interactive Club World Cup," where gamers from different clubs compete against each other.</seg>
<seg id="1620">In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or PSV Eindhoven qualified for example.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Robin Dutt also sees great potential in the e-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1622">The ex-trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen is now advising an agency for virtual football players.</seg>
<seg id="1623">"real football must deal particularly with the 14 to 30-year-olds, that young people will continue to go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="1624">And: the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets, especially the Asian ones.</seg>
<seg id="1625">With prominent e-athletes under contract it is possible to be present online far more often in these markets than to send the Bundesliga team to Asia once a year.</seg>
<seg id="1626">What is it all about?</seg>
<seg id="1627">At E-Sport, computer games such as "League Of Legends," "Dota 2," "Counterstrike" or the FIFA soccer game simulation will be fostered at competitive level.</seg>
<seg id="1628">As in normal sports, Ligen has long since become established in which the pros are competing against each other.</seg>
<seg id="1629">And E-sport is already part of the official program in the Asian Games 2022.</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it a real sport at all?</seg>
<seg id="1631">For many, the idea is certainly getting used to getting used to it.</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Frobie has also dealt with the question for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="1633">For the professor at the Deutsche Sporthochschule in Cologne, e-sport is a sport because it is competitive and showing many biological and physical reactions which can also be found in classical sports - for example increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.</seg>
<seg id="1634">In addition, it needs cognitive abilities, a technical and tactical understanding and a quick reaction.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Professional gamers should train not only the console but also their body and pay attention to the nutrition.</seg>
<seg id="1636">"the fit player is a good player."</seg>
<seg id="1637">"" "but Frobie also sees problems:" "" "doping becomes increasingly a topic." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1638">Controls were difficult to perform in online games, and in the scene the structures of classical sports were missing.</seg>
<seg id="1639">The scientists emphasise the high integrative effect of e-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1640">Players are internationally on the move, that's like a big global family, there are no cross-cultural barriers.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A study by Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment software (BIU) predicts rapid growth in E-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1642">In 2016, 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany, mainly via advertising, sponsoring and big tournaments.</seg>
<seg id="1643">In three years, sales are expected to be 130 million.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the Bundesliga, this is little.</seg>

<seg id="1730">Natus sees the largest turnaround in infrastructure policy: the gap of the motorway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the priority list of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1731">This year the Ministry hopes for a planning process, until 2021 the construction law is expected to stand.</seg>
<seg id="1732">A role in the plans of the country is also played by the West circumvention of Trier, which stands in the urgent need of the federal road plan.</seg>
<seg id="1733">The goal is to put the circuit into operation in December 2020, says the Ministry spokeswoman Cornelia Holtmann.</seg>
<seg id="1734">Natus sees this as a sign to support regional, but internationally competing companies.</seg>
<seg id="1735">The Chamber of Industry and Commerce (IHK) Trier is striving, as suggested by Wissing, a Rhineland-Palatinate label with wine in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports that have been sagging for ten years.</seg>

<seg id="1740">The planned road construction is quick facts to create, but at the same time it is missing the necessary personnel, says Jan Glockauer, chief executive of the Chamber of Commerce of Trier.</seg>
<seg id="1741">Until now, only 29 jobs have been occupied by 56 new engineers who want to set up Wissing at the regional company mobility.</seg>

<seg id="1756">But nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered carcinogens and may cause asthma.</seg>
<seg id="1757">The costs for car manufacturers to install equipment for neutralization of exhaust gases that are ejected from diesel vehicles are also increasing, making it difficult to keep cars competitive.</seg>
<seg id="1758">German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of outing the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1759">The companies try to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen, which could regulate the use of so-called shutters, which could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested, but in normal driving conditions.</seg>

<seg id="1761">Last month, the former Head of Thermodynamics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1762">The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be brought to court in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1763">At the beginning of this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen, after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circumvent the emissions regulations in Europe, and a request focused on the United States was expanded.</seg>
<seg id="1764">The involvement of Audi in the study could be difficult for Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer contributes a disproportionately high degree to Volkswagen's profit.</seg>

<seg id="1779">"" "his message: laugh," "" "for there is too much suffering in the world." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1780">Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In the first years as an artist, he proposed himself as a signatory for greeting cards - which frustrated him.</seg>
<seg id="1782">"the happiest day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job," he once said.</seg>
<seg id="1783">At the end of the 1960s, after stops in Lima, New York and Paris, he made his breakthrough: with the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then also in the "Stern" and other leading magazines around the world.</seg>
<seg id="1784">Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Again and again the artist was inspired by cities.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Large, round Mordillo pieces cavort in drawings with the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1787">In the early morning, according to his own information, he still sits at the drawing table, works almost ten hours daily.</seg>

<seg id="1789">He has been working on a cartoon and a TV show with his characters for six years.</seg>

<seg id="1796">It has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The lavender is declining due to insect-reminding conditions and insect-borne insects, which causes scientists and farmers trying to find solutions, causing great headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, expert of the CRIEPPAM agricultural research institute in Provence, said: "the lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant in the past years has exposed the effects of climate change, which in the spring brought much less rain and much more in the fall.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has effects on the lifespan of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">There is also a small cichade, a micro-bacterium that transmits the dwarf cicades, and in very dry weather there are many of it. "</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The employees of the weekly newspaper Riodoce usually meet Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">They were told that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-level journalists discuss what feels more secure: they are supposed to bring their children into the office, which were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words on a plaque on the front of the room: opponents, Neutral, Allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is needed, perceptions and gut feelings suffice.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of standing on the government's payroll or cartels, a catalogue of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no break from violence, and while the bodies accumulate in the whole country, more and more journalists are there: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto entered his office in December 2012. 589 are subject to attacks and threats under federal protection and until now there have been at least seven deaths in seven countries this year.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter are their editors and their inspiration from Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence is felt deep, although his presence is everywhere - a big photo of Valdez presenting his middle finger with the word "Justice." two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts showing his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss about their shared topics, the trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although a Special Attorney Office was established in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists, it has only initiated two criminal proceedings, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most thousands of murders, which are associated with drug trafficking and organised crime, the killers of journalists are rarely brought to trial.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodoce they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa although they are inconsolable and although the terrain is now even more traiteful.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information on the murderers, without justice, the meeting to discuss safety has little benefit, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "as long as we don't know the why, we stumble." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He only managed to drive a few blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times he was shot on him, presumably because of the name of the newspaper - the "twelfth river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter rode away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two grown-up children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly around in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the subject of Valdez, there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzman's arrest in January and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country since rivaling factions are fighting to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It does not matter that in Sinaloa one or more people are shot on the street every day or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-story mausoleums for drug kings that are larger than many houses for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">"" "" "" "forget for a minute that there is a state of" "" "peace" "" "if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and trade routes in the United States." ""</seg>
<seg id="1838">Nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, was broken with the blame that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First of all there was the publication of an interview with Damascus Lopez, one of the leaders of one of the rival cartel fractions in the war with Guzman's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have annoyed the sons, guessed aisle members purchased every copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper kiosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own security following the confiscation of another newspaper, which had published the same story.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for noroeste in 2003 when he joined with five colleagues to set up Riodoce and sold 50 US dollar holdings.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "in Sinaloa," "" "it was impossible to run journalism without encountering the drug-toxin problem," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1847">Over time, the newspaper has earned a reputation because of courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters liked to be able to publish hard-fitting investigations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to treat.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot Award" for her reporting in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award for the protection of journalists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drug history, wherever it led.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He willingly admitted he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I want to continue living," he said at the time of the CPJ Award.</seg>
<seg id="1853">"" "drugs trade in Sinaloa" "" "is a way of life," "" "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV." ""</seg>
<seg id="1854">"" "" "" "you have to take over the task that suits you as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb." ""</seg>
<seg id="1855">"" "I don't want to be asked:" "" "what have you done in the face of so many dead... why didn't you tell us what was going on?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Riodoce team missed Valdez, the fun bird that was cursing like a dockworker, a friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit there at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now they ask, Was His love for routine destruction?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how they can best do their job and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"" "" "" "they don't like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret runways and runways" "" "to move drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells wrong, stay away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">"" "the anger is, the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that" "" "smell is a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing with Javier is happening." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa, as not as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a poisonous mixture of lucrative smuggling, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is changing constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the space where the staff of Riodoce met for safety training, no mobile phones suddenly were allowed. days earlier, it became known that spyware, which is exclusively sold to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside, two policemen tried shelter from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a mid-size district of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the joke, some of the reporters asked if these officers were among the 50 percent of the policemen, whom the governor was not trustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months since the reporters went to the mountain landscape, where drug gangs are de facto under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week, Riodoce has fucked on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former famous speaker Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé about the state expenditures concentrated on the governor's home town.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group located in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block away from the office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite local drug dealer and government.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who ruled the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which ruled almost the whole century all the political levels.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several PRI governors were accused of high-caliber cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous events in this restaurant, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military attack.</seg>
<seg id="1883">Only a few months earlier, readers of Valdez had looked at Valdez's column as the best informed source of abduction.</seg>
<seg id="1884">"earlier we had known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El Flaco" because of his slender body stature.</seg>
<seg id="1885">"" "" "" "now all channels of communication with our sources are broken." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1886">Valdez's office became a storage room for signs and stickers that protesting against the killings of journalists, because the employees have become something they themselves never expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez took a few signs and went to a demonstration next morning for another journalist to the office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burnt body has been discovered and officials say based on DNA testing that it is his.</seg>
<seg id="1890">Journalists have become louder all over the country by writing down on pavements and buildings in organized protests by "SOS Press."</seg>
<seg id="1891">On this day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1892">During a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying journalists and letting them kill because they have said the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has asked since then that she is again divided by the government, because she is worried that her anger has violated her objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were "surrounded" by organised crime, the government officials involved and an indifferent society.</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his last book "Narco Journalism," he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the orders of politicians and security forces who were hiding under a blanket with organised crime.</seg>

<seg id="1929">According to National Geographic reports, the herbivorous herbivores are the best preserved fossil of its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">It was found by Shawn Funk on March 21, 2011 at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.</seg>
<seg id="1931">He hit something that seemed out of the surrounding rock out of place, and decided to look more closely.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years trying to uncover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) of heavy petroglyphs.</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you only blink a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it slept," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is to be seen.</seg>

<seg id="1937">Researchers have found that this herbivorous, although covered with a armor and resembles a changing tank, probably threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The heavily armoured dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as counterfading, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have allowed us to get better acquainted with his surroundings and to avoid his enemies, say experts, suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million-year-old creature from the family of the Nodosaurier has made headlines in May and is now to be seen at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild animal and named Borealopelta markmitchelli following the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team who has spent more than 7,000 hours to uncover it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The astonishing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and armour over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the shading, a widespread defense method in animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the shading is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of today living animals.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It points to the dinosaurs being hunted by carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution favored the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most contemporary animals that use the shading - think of deer, zebras or belt animals - are much smaller and vulnerable than loot, which signalizes that this Nodoscope was exposed to a real struggle for survival.</seg>

<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to study the animal on critics concerning his life, including his conserved intestinal content to find out what it has eaten as his last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, got into a river and was driven out into the sea, where he sank back to the bottom of the sea.</seg>

<seg id="1958">The scientists, whose latest findings are published in Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was sinking after death in the sea and mumified in mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Funk on 21 March 2011 at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum, it is the world's best-preserved dinosaur, including skin and armor, and is completely from muzzle to hip.</seg>

<seg id="1975">According to the first data of the police, at 17.00 o'clock between the connecting places Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (district Aichach-Friedberg) during a thunderstorm close to 30 vehicles, among them probably also trucks, crashed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">At first there were no indications of the exact number of injured.</seg>
<seg id="1977">"" "" "" "it is a matter of light to moderate injuries," "" "said a police spokesman." ""</seg>

<seg id="1987">It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced once: nothing escapes in the train and sleeps.</seg>

<seg id="1989">And then: muffled.</seg>

<seg id="1993">The Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the free ticket inspection.</seg>
<seg id="1994">You simply confirm by mobile phone that you take your seat and use it to validate the ticket.</seg>

<seg id="1999">To be able to use them, however, some requirements must be met: you need a smartphone or tablet.</seg>
<seg id="2000">And you have to book an online ticket - what already most passengers do anyway.</seg>
<seg id="2001">It also has to be bought by the app of the railway, the DB navigator, which is anyway the most convenient type of ticket booking.</seg>
<seg id="2002">And last but not least, you need a seat reservation.</seg>

<seg id="2006">When the driver arrives at the ticket inspection in place Y, he knows that there is a passenger with a pre-paid online ticket.</seg>

<seg id="2012">Those who often ride a train knows that in addition to delays and missed trains, ticket controls are one of the biggest nuisances.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Because oftentimes you don't have all the documents you need for the devaluation of online tickets.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Either the credit card or the ID card or otherwise a document you have to show.</seg>
<seg id="2015">The result is endless discussions between train attendant and passenger, which leads to bad mood in the compartment or large area and delays in controlling your own tickets and takes the Schaffner at the end time to take care of other concerns.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.</seg>

<seg id="2020">On 9 August 2014 Brittany Ferrell was shaken to its core.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Only one day after she arrived in New York City, the apartment in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an airbnb apartment they rented and scrolling through Facebook on their phone.</seg>
<seg id="2022">She stumbled over a post from someone from the High School.</seg>

<seg id="2028">"" "" "" "that's wild," "" "said Ferrell." ""</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She left her cell phone in order to return to Tweets on the Canfield-Drive later in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There were photos of the police band and people screaming, and of a man who claimed to be Brown's father wearing a sign with the inscription: "Ferguson's police killed just my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="2032">She observed a live feed where a policeman stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">"" "in another video, she said, another policeman said his rifle and cried," "" "I'm going to kill you..." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not usual," Ferrell remembered her statement.</seg>
<seg id="2035">"" "" "" "this is not the type of murder we have gotten used to and that we can be typical." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2036">At that moment, I felt chills.</seg>
<seg id="2037">"" "I was angry and wept." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2038">She booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After the landing at 23 o'clock she fetched her six-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would drive to Ferguson the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the subject of a new documentary, "Whose Streets?," in the cinemas from the 11th.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance, which consists of the perspective of the people living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">When Ferrell came to Ferguson with her daughter, who carried a flower-dress and a matching crown, the two spoke a conversation that they had "over the black experience and the black state countless times before this morning."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"" "" "" "you remember how I taught you when black people must fight for what they believe?" "" "she remembered what she said." ""</seg>

<seg id="2048">It must be well developed not only activism and organization, but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution, and what we have to do to free ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Even if I have the luck to give her an experience, in which she personally does not experience blatant racism, she is no different from the next black female child.</seg>
<seg id="2050">"" "I feel I would be doing a bad service to keep them away from it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2051">The first stop when they arrived in Ferguson was on the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority, which became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non-charge of officer Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There Ferrell and her daughter were connected with a local business owner who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to protesters.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new type of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism totally changed after 9 August," she said, and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organising.</seg>
<seg id="2057">"" "it's all come." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later, Ferrell met during an evening demonstration, Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors.</seg>
<seg id="2059">"" "Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to" "" "document" "" "what happened." ""</seg>
<seg id="2060">"" "one question asked Ferrell:" "" "do you want to document or try to find a story you can use?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2061">This scepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often of whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2062">"" "as Folayan recently stated in an interview," "" "we heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan had already worked together with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the field known for his activism around death stract prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="2064">His engagement brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other natives, the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after Browning's shooting.</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks or talks to us. we speak," Davis said.</seg>
<seg id="2066">"" "" "" "that was the main thing for me as these people are represented, for so I will be represented." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2067">The goal was not to focus on Ferrells's experience - to show that the movement "is not a Messiah leader, but a community that comes together," said Folayan - it proved to be the most obvious participant in the film.</seg>
<seg id="2068">"" "as a result, documents of" "" "Whose Streets" "" "show the surprising personal aspects of Ferrara's life as she loves and marries her wife." ""</seg>
<seg id="2069">"" "" "" "I felt naked," "" "said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time." ""</seg>
<seg id="2070">"" "" "" "but I understood that there must be a certain vulnerability in this work and for the humanization of black people." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2071">In addition, Ferrells's history repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black-Lives-Matter movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founders of the movement, who after the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 have shaped the film "BlackLivesMatter" in social media, identify themselves as gay.</seg>
<seg id="2073">"" "" "" "black, gay women in leadership positions have borne the movement altogether," "" "said Ferrell," "" "and we are constantly fighting on different fronts." ""</seg>
<seg id="2074">"" "black gay women must bear the brunt of everything." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2075">"" "Folayan agreed to note that" "" "the movement really is held up by black women and many black women." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2076">"" "however, it insists that" "" "this is not an affirmatively type of action" "", "in which Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film because of her identity." ""</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person shaking this energy," she said.</seg>
<seg id="2078">"" "" "" "it is no accident, although it was at the front, because in a life at these crossings as a black, gay woman stands as much in the game." ""</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel their energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">In the meantime the news cameras in Ferguson have disappeared long ago, but the racial connections between the congregation and the police continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on guard for 2 ½ years due to the blocking of a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "a chaos."</seg>

<seg id="2088">From "dream" to "megalomania": TV readers discuss about bit gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves people even though it hasn't been built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre on the south end of the pedestrian zone has been splitting the population in proponents and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The theme is hardly any cold.</seg>
<seg id="2092">"" "the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page" "" "Volksfreund Bitburg" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2093">While some say to the bit gallery: "that would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That's really great" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side: "no man needs" (Siggi Betzen) or simply: "megalomania!" (Lars Scholz).</seg>
<seg id="2094">While the proponents build that a gallery attracts more customers to the city, the other businesses profit from it, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2095">In addition, the gallery is planned precisely on the premises on which the farmer's market hall stands, where 13 direct brands offer their products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">This will stop at the beginning of the construction work.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The gallery makers wish to integrate a market hall into the new building - for Beda-Platz with possibility to sit outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Room: "we have been shopping for almost a week in the peasant market hall for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the Landwives time and again very gladly.</seg>
<seg id="2100">We also discovered the butchery for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would like that even while and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities, there is that too.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Especially the Kleinmarkthalle in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "whether direct marketing in a market hall in the gallery can be located, depends on the amount of the rent.</seg>
<seg id="2105">"" "but this should not be low for the new project." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "why shopping sprees in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">Whether clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I find that unnecessary.</seg>
<seg id="2108">There's enough of that in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">You can see how many stores here are empty - some have been waiting for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">But since there is not even a regular weekly market, it is all the more important that at least the Markthalle is maintained.</seg>
<seg id="2111">After all, the goods offered there are fresh, mostly offered directly from the producer and is also reasonably priced.</seg>
<seg id="2112">As you can see, stores in a shopping centre are rented only by larger companies, as the rents there are often unsustainable for a retailer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Too bad, special deals are almost no longer and what is left of it will probably disappear. "</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping mall with a Markthalle doesn't fit for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit into Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Above all: where should the peasant market hall be held during the construction period?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old Edeka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery actually comes.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or does the ghost bit gallery actually manage to drive all business from Bitburg? "</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "that won't work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">And there is no need for a shopping center that is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2121">In my view it would have been better to promote a real farmer's market, instead of this gallery.</seg>
<seg id="2122">But for a peasant market hall, thanks to the unbelievably many - as I find - meaningless construction projects in Bitburg no longer place any space.</seg>
<seg id="2123">When the peasant market hall is destroyed, a piece of culture will disappear again. "</seg>
<seg id="2124">A matching similarity: artist creates portraits featuring Chelsea Manning's DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the space of the fridman Gallery in New York, many faces are visible - white, black and brown, almost imperceptible - hanging on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfern and haircuts that were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former secret service analyst took a 35-year prison sentence after making public diplomatic notifications about the WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition opened on August 2 is called A Becoming resemblance (A matching similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combined its expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a Transwoman and a pioneering dissident, whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Through algorithmic analysis of DNA, which has been extracted from Manning and created out of 30 portraits, Dewey-Hagborg shows a sharp, albeit slightly intellectual comment, not only in the form of DNA data - the many ways it can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also created for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born in Bradley Edward, but openly talked about identification as a woman since her puberty, was convicted in 2013 for 20 charges, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Through the prison her picture was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a grained black-and-white selfie in which Manning sits invisibly on a driver's seat and wearing a platinblonde wig - with which she was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg was just about the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">The artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette butts and chewing gum using DNA from waste to produce a picture of how these people might look.</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"" "" "" "they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," "" "said Dewey-Hagborg in a press review of the new exhibition." ""</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she couldn't visit her and she couldn't be photographed, so she got in contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her detained muse were too unequal, who changed several letters over the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created one of Shoili Kanungo illustrated Comic "Suppressed Images," which foresaw a future in which the President Chats Overseas will convert judgment and would be able to see the exhibition in person.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama was actually only a few days after the book was released to demand Manning release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome type of happy encounter.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also now at the opening of the exhibition something deep and strong, as Donald Trump performs a war against informants from the government camp and against Transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to further inflame the rigid divisions that he should actually remedy.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked for the strange timing of all these things she said that "things are going to happen for a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning stressed with her superlarge signature (the "i" in her family name is marked with a heart) an end to "automatic fragmentation, whose basis gender, race, sexuality and culture have been."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandler of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg was hoping to show through the inclusion of the 200 characters (or nucleotides according to the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist), as astonishingly similar, at least in a biological sense, we are all.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully take with it is that our genome doesn't care who we are and how openly genetic data is for interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work from 2007, Spurious Memories, is also visible.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"" "" "" "DNA data can tell so many different stories so that's 30 of these stories." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in a separate room, is a page from the above-mentioned comic-novelle.</seg>
<seg id="2149">It shows Manning how she emerges from the discipline of discipline of the United States like King Kong with a hands-on phone.</seg>

<seg id="2153">"I still get goosebumps when I talk about it."</seg>
<seg id="2154">Manning has not seen the exhibition personally - as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if it was to do it, it will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks, from their own genomic simulations, which assemble themselves like hordes of protesters.</seg>

<seg id="2181">Russian Deputy Vitaly Mutko said it won't last long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti-doping agency (RUSADA).</seg>

<seg id="2184">The PM featured the second part of WADA's schedule to comply with the code that describes the criteria for re-enforcing RUSADA and recently published on the organization's website.</seg>
<seg id="2185">According to Mutko, he does not include anything that could cause concern for Russia.</seg>

<seg id="2189">"" "in terms of the matter, Mutko said:" "" "we carry out the investigation as our anti-doping system has made a mistake." ""</seg>

<seg id="2204">Amy Errett wanted to measure the luck with your e-commerce start-up, but the surveys didn't work.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Answers were often vague, little helpful or - worse - fraudulent.</seg>
<seg id="2206">And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.</seg>
<seg id="2207">"" "" "" "there was never consistency and objectivity," "" "said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care company Madison Reed." ""</seg>
<seg id="2208">She called people from outside for help.</seg>
<seg id="2209">A new Human Resources start-ups breed is growing in order to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee involvement, it enables companies to offer surveys, offer specific groups and demographical groups, staff anonymity and complaints hotlines, and in some cases, whistleblowers allow to circumvent the C Suite executives and turn directly to the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"you now have tools such as Strava and Fitbit to track your health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.</seg>
<seg id="2212">Errett said that she has a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years won with Glint.</seg>
<seg id="2213">In addition to the Snap surveys and surveys from specific teams, it provides a heat card of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which managers have low-response results - so you can drill down why.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Companies are coming to see that they have to stay at the top of the workplace culture, so that you won't be the next Uber who has been involved in scandals since a former employee has published a blog post describing an environment of harassment where those who have spoken, were punished.</seg>
<seg id="2215">For start-ups such as Glint, this wish is a lucrative business possibility after an overview.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The global governance, regulation and compliance sector could have a value of more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to the "Let's Talk Payments" financial portal.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, start-up Convercent, who helps companies to prevent bad behaviour and identify, saw an increasing interest and activity beginning this year amid the Uber-Falles in Misskredit.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="2219">Recently registered as a client.</seg>
<seg id="2220">As Glint, Convercent will send you customized "pulse" surveys, collect sensitive answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas.</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also provides an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2222">And when the main managing director is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"" "" "" "the court of public opinion has captured the regulators," "" "said Patrick Quinlan, founder and managing director of Convercent." ""</seg>
<seg id="2224">If a company is found that treats its employees poorly or behaves unethically, it can experience costly consequences by consumer boycott, employee fluctuation and complaints, said Quinlan.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites, Convercent has used for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Earlier if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or e-mail for the company headquarters, submit formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel who said there was no good way to track down the complaints of staff.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now, as the company Convercent uses, problems that were previously hidden by executives who were sitting in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair practice, can be identified and addressed more quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2229">"" "" "" "I can get closer to this holistic, 360-degree view of working with employment," "" "said Vitrano, who heads the Risk Management Group of Ruby Tuesday." ""</seg>
<seg id="2230">"" "" "" "and we protect our shareholders against employment disputes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2231">Companies started to take ethics, values and employee engagement in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed because of ethical violations by the Enron scandal, said Quinlan.</seg>
<seg id="2232">"" "but it took until the" "" "social media came to their right" "" "that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry on-line." ""</seg>
<seg id="2233">"" "" "" "before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2234">Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service, and burden the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance to find the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">Convercent received $10 million for funding in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, with which the total capital was raised to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Glitzers secured $10 million in November of Bessemer's Venture Partners and brought his entire funding to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">These investments are hardly surprising given the connected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing research complex that shows that today's employees expect more from their jobs than before.</seg>
<seg id="2240">In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only applications.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"if people are happy to be in a company, feel that their voices heard, and that the work you do is worth it, then they feel more committed to making this business successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.</seg>
<seg id="2243">Investors reach yields if their portfolio companies run well. businesses run well when employees are committed and engaged.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data on employee engagement in accordance with the experts of workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data is useless if the administrator of a company does not take action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">In fact, when a company asks employees for your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the changes are not fast enough or not at all, this can cause disappointments and demotivate employees.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"if you ask for 4000 suggestions, you have to be ready to have 4.000 talks," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kotter International, who has seen companies that have left too much on collecting data.</seg>
<seg id="2250">"" "" "" "for if you don't follow people ask yourself," "" "Have you really heard me?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2251">Do you care about it?</seg>
<seg id="2252">And if you don't care why, why should I? "</seg>
<seg id="2253">Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly associate surveys, was able to initiate measures on the same day if a problem is reported about Glint, Errett.</seg>
<seg id="2254">And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, it was able to reorganize several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">At Ruby Tuesday, the company always gets new insights into the employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this leads to a better bonding of employees in a sector that is known for high turnover.</seg>
<seg id="2256">"" "" "" "if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you will lose the people," "" "said Vitrano." ""</seg>

<seg id="2291">In his recent past the little Scotney castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970's and 1980's.</seg>
<seg id="2292">But Scotney has spent 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy seat at the River Valley in Kent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaired Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.</seg>
<seg id="2293">"" "" "" "I find it so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," "" "he says with a melancholy voice." ""</seg>

<seg id="2295">"a Castle in England" spans the period from the Middle Ages to the Age of Edward and documents the families living in Scotney. each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Steiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.</seg>
<seg id="2296">It is not the first book of Rhodes, which is based on an archive: he wrote 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories' in 2014, a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpectedly emotional.</seg>
<seg id="2297">"" "" "" "I only reacted to the thumb print on the side of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700's who worked for the Jacobins," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2298">"" "" "" "this is its thumb print!" ""</seg>
<seg id="2299">And letters always smell of smoke, because at that time a fire was kindled because of the light.</seg>
<seg id="2300">For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect as if it were himself.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Oh, I love archives! "</seg>
<seg id="2302">For someone who is so beaten with old papers that he was supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ("To be honest: I have overrated my welcome pits a bit") seems to be all too beautiful to be true.</seg>
<seg id="2303">Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyena pots on the walls and the bottles that spent centuries in the ditch.</seg>
<seg id="2304">He walked through the grounds and the ruins of the old castle, and spoke with landscaping, gardeners and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Then, at night he drank "Whiskey and began to write."</seg>
<seg id="2306">The intimate story of Scotney is relatively unknown since the National Trust was only granted full access until 2006, when the last Erbin, Elizabeth Hussey, died.</seg>
<seg id="2307">When Rhodes intervened a decade later, the employees just started to take care of the archive that he described as "hundreds of years in which aristocrats said" Oh, cast it down on the attic. "</seg>
<seg id="2308">Diaries, letters from the era of English Empire, maps that represent who possessed something: "one could think that land conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch fighting the two families.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Guys, let everything go their way! "</seg>
<seg id="2310">Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive on a broader base into English history, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle in order to join the peasant uprising of 1381.</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a record of a turmoil that occurred in 1380 in the castle, in this book titled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex', Rhodes says.</seg>

<seg id="2314">Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like 'The Priest', which narrates the history of the Jesuit paters, which the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Or 'The Smuggler', in which the smugglers Arthur Darrell is portrayed from the 18th century, which staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery that was made only years later when his coffin was excavated).</seg>

<seg id="2338">Every year at the beginning of August in Ankara, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) deliberates on pensionings and promotions in officer corps.</seg>
<seg id="2339">This week too.</seg>
<seg id="2340">At first glance, a normal process.</seg>
<seg id="2341">But nothing is routine for Turkish armed forces one year after the coup attempt.</seg>
<seg id="2342">The meeting did not take place in the building of the General Staff, as before, but in the presidency of the Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Under the presidency of the head of government, the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Minister of Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs participated in the discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2344">As a result, the civilians in the YAS were in excess.</seg>
<seg id="2345">The government is attracting the reins in the military.</seg>
<seg id="2346">The Chief of Staff, Hulusi Akar, remains in office, but the officers of the army, the Air Force, and the Navy were dismissed.</seg>
<seg id="2347">Since the coup failed, head of state Erdogan 169 of the 326 generals and admirals were fired.</seg>
<seg id="2348">More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged connections to the movement of the Exile Preacher Fethullah Gülen, which Erdogan sees as a wirepuller of the coup attempt.</seg>
<seg id="2349">Against 486 people allegedly involved in the coup attempt, Ankara has been negotiating in Ankara since this week.</seg>
<seg id="2350">Already on the day after the coup, Erdogan had described the coup attempt as "God's present," as he gave him the opportunity to "completely clean the armed forces."</seg>
<seg id="2351">But does Erdogan really have the army under control?</seg>
<seg id="2352">At the end of February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article with the title "uneasiness in the military headquarters."</seg>
<seg id="2353">In the general staff there are concerns about the increasing "Islamisation" of the army, which, among other things, manifests itself in the lifting of the ban on cloth for soldiers, wrote the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2354">In any case, large-scale incorporation in the army and the security forces continues.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In mid-July, Erdogan was fired by a decree of 7395 governors, including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers.</seg>

<seg id="2382">"" "" "" "with this, the roadmap, the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated," "" "expired." ""</seg>

<seg id="2385">The Rennsteig-Shuttle is a popular railway link between the railway stations Ilmenau and Rennsteig.</seg>
<seg id="2386">Over the past few months, a pilot plant has been tested whether the route is used by a large number of people in order to order them regularly in the future.</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real and we should be worried</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought it can't become even more crazy in 2017, a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots is coming.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, indeed.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big deal.</seg>
<seg id="2392">The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, Emeritus Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at Sheffield University and Co-Founder of FRR, we have to start taking their ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people are funny about them, but the companies deliver a lot of them, and we'll see them much more often," said Mr. Sharkey at the release of his new report.</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sex dolls have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with deliberately human reactions reaching through artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can "adapt" his robot according to his beliefs and select everything from the eye color of the robot to the shape of the nipples to the type or colour of his fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2398">But it becomes even more disturbing since many robots have the "personalities" that would make a Stepford woman look progressive.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sex dolls have developed into robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">For example, the RealBotix robot enables its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing such as shyness.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is the Roxxxy gold sex robot developed by True Companion, with pre-programmed personalities like "Frigid Farrah," which imparts the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality adapted to your personality as best as possible," enthuses the site of True Companion.</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">She also has her moods in the course of the day - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "she can be tired, be fixed on conversation, or she can" "" "be in the mood" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships, but the submissive female characteristics, the allusions to rape, when one step on frigid (i.e. here: reluctant) Farrah is concerned, worrying a most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website true Companion Roxxxy has a vibrator but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men then have no Roxxxy?" it says on the website.</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just just another sex toy.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their emergence and increasing refinement point to something dark and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional encore.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men will of course have no sex robots, and while the FRR noted their increasing popularity, they still remain on the brink of consumption culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what leaks out of the borderlands can be very instructive regarding the spirit of time in which we live.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots emerge in a time when women's rights are threatened by women around the world in which there is a president in the White House who has boasted women to have been sexually assaulted.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most horrible aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the maid ') are not the graphic images, the intricate body and the stochastic eyes, but how realistic this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a jump, but at the moment it does not feel like a big jump.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to produce a physical similarity to actual women as realistically as technically possible (even with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their growers want them to feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">But, brought to the point when it comes to their "personalities," the robots are not real women.</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no mediation or background story, nothing suggesting independence or anything that might disturb the imagination of total submission.</seg>
<seg id="2422">In other words, they are pleasing slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to put it in the words of 2017: maids</seg>
<seg id="2424">Trumps high performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a plurality of the Trump era that the political divisions which polarized US voters have also split families in small format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, there were newspapers in the USA with advice about how to deal with the horror of Trump choosing relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We all reportedly obey all of us in order to burst our filter bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noticed is the power of Trumps to bring together families.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a leopard poet who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">It reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House, everyone who knows them, including the republican relationship with which she had fought for decades because of politics, suddenly and quite especial on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">This is certainly a good thing around the dining table, but it is important to me that this also entails considerable risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was strengthened by Trump, but the detrimental effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">When we speak of "normalization" and Trump, we refer to the creepy possibility that his kittens will no longer be aborted.</seg>
<seg id="2436">There is, however, an even more complicated long-term scenario, normalized in the Trump Republicans of the right wing, which suddenly appear as the epitome of reasonableness in comparison to its standards.</seg>
<seg id="2437">I find myself today from an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's original version of the madman - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked out) - both in comparison to Trump in fact occur to one as very mild crimes.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republican only needs to be mentally healthy in order to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the New York park's carousels, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are growling and the animals twist to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climate-permitting music conveys this in a strange way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of tall buildings become old, the skylines are too familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city is not just the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I am still not completely over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss Cottage in fact - the ThemePub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage counts not - but a big roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">The Central Park carousel is still a strange, magical experience, since two years old, a 11-year-old and two women in the 40-s can go on it and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have evaluated the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately no one asked for it.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before I could go through my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same plus the option to balance the rating with a 15% tip - this in order to buy something about the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This not only leads to a slowdown of what should actually be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store stood disheartening, while I was tired of having the experience to submit my credit card with five stars.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Oscar Pistorius moves back to hospital with chest pain</seg>
<seg id="2450">For the second time, Pistorius left the prison for a hospital visit.</seg>
<seg id="2451">Last year he was brought to the hospital because of the treatment of cuts on his wrists, which he suffered from prison authorities according to a case in his cell.</seg>
<seg id="2452">He was sentenced to a first death sentence for murder pursuant to an appeal by the prosecutors.</seg>
<seg id="2453">He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013, firing them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Pistorius claimed that he kept his girlfriend for a nocturnal invader hiding in the cabin.</seg>
<seg id="2455">The prosecutors announced their intention to appeal this time against the six-year jail sentence of Pistorius Appeal, of which they say it was too lenient.</seg>
<seg id="2456">The National prosecution authority said that it was lodged with the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the appeal could be heard this year.</seg>
<seg id="2457">Pistorius is at risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful.</seg>
<seg id="2458">There is no death penalty in South Africa.</seg>

<seg id="2535">Roland Wacker, Haslach Stadtbaumeister, will retire next year.</seg>
<seg id="2536">The place is already written - but suitable candidates are rare.</seg>
<seg id="2537">For 31 years Wacker has been a City Engineer.</seg>
<seg id="2538">And the work makes him still great fun as he communicates in the press conference.</seg>
<seg id="2539">He reports on varied but challenging tasks waiting for his successor.</seg>
<seg id="2540">At the same time, it is surprising that until now no application has fulfilled the requirements profile.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time.</seg>
<seg id="2542">This should be enough time for a familiarisation while respecting the statutory periods of notice.</seg>
<seg id="2543">Since Haslach serves as the Lower Construction Law Office for the Administrative Community, the applicant must demonstrate appropriate conclusions.</seg>
<seg id="2544">For this function wants to keep the city in any case.</seg>
<seg id="2545">If it would not be able to fill this out, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg for consultation.</seg>
<seg id="2546">But the proximity to the citizens is important to the city and to it, says Wacker, who reports from a good working climate and good atmosphere between the authority and the citizens.</seg>

<seg id="2556">"" "" "" "you can move a lot," "" "says Wacker, and the design of the green spaces is often referenced by citizens and visitors." ""</seg>
<seg id="2557">As the old town as an ensemble is under monument protection, it is important to "have an eye for what fits in," when new buildings are approved, the outgoing city building master emphasizes.</seg>
<seg id="2558">Anyway, the City Engineer is responsible for a high level of responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="2559">"" "he is a builder," "" "in the end, everything runs over my table." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2562">Continuity is not only important for a good working climate, but also for the further design of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2563">According to the city of Haslach, whoever wants to bequeath Roland Wacker should have completed a degree in degree as a diploma engineer or a bachelor's degree in the field of architecture and have good knowledge in the fields of construction planning and planning law.</seg>

<seg id="2574">The damage was repaired on Friday afternoon, the rail traffic on the South railway line could be run without obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2575">Nearly ten people had dropped out on Friday morning, two of them concerned the long-distance traffic.</seg>
<seg id="2576">Freight trains did not fall out, but they had delay.</seg>
<seg id="2577">According to ÖBB-spokesman Christoph Posch, around 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2578">Insulators and masts have also been damaged.</seg>
<seg id="2579">Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help relieve IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study claims just the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable condition, which affects approximately 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the United States, causes stomach cramps and flatulence, recurring or bloody diarrhea, weight loss, and extreme tiredness.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While the sufferers are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant bowel.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researcher, Dr Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells are patrolling in the intestines in order to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in food do not penetrate the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are able to trigger inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging delicate tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the balance is too far towards inflammation, it can result in inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments, it was found that a kind of tolerance promoted immune cell in mice that carry a certain bacterium in their intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan, one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have established a connection between a bacteria species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan had mice in their food, the more they had of these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet tolerant of tryptophane encourages more tolerable, less inflammatory intestinal milieus if the same system also works with humans.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The postdoctoral researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan investigates a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same family, who had been separated, had not.</seg>
<seg id="2593">They suspected that the difference with the intestinal microbial chromosomes had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which usually live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The mice of mice were sequenced and six bacteria species found in mice with immune cells were found, but were missing in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in a sterile environment so that they did not develop an intestinal microbiome and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they were created by L. reuteri and immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">To understand the effects of bacteria on the immune system, the researchers led L. reuteri to grow in a fluid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid without the bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated from the mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism, known as idol-3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of the mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan values were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan declared that humans have the same tolerance-promoting cells such as mice, and that most of us L. reuteri protect our gastrointestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether tryptophan-by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">"" "she said," "" "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote since these cells control inflammation on the intestinal surface." ""</seg>

<seg id="2674">At the beginning of the information session, Schindler gave a review of what happened so far.</seg>

<seg id="2676">At that time, in the refurbishment area I from 1991 to 2004, the Land Baden-Württemberg adopted two thirds of the subsidy amount.</seg>
<seg id="2677">In the restructuring area II from 2005 to 2016, the subsidy was still at 60 percent.</seg>
<seg id="2678">For Schindler, the previous refurbishments are a "success project" - it is finally important to promote internal development and not only to open up new building areas.</seg>
<seg id="2679">On April 4, I received the information from the Regierungspräsidium Karlsruhe, that there will be a restructuring area III.</seg>
<seg id="2680">The sum of the subsidy amounts to 833 333 euros, of which 500 000 Euros are from the country, the rest of the community sensitised.</seg>

<seg id="2691">Until September this year, however, the survey will take place only once, within the framework of those involved in the rehabilitation area to fill out a questionnaire.</seg>
<seg id="2692">In November or December, it is planned to take place as soon as possible, so that the refurbishments can begin next year.</seg>

<seg id="2716">The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was the centerpiece of the event on 17 July in the White House with American construction programs.</seg>
<seg id="2717">President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior civil servants of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states.</seg>
<seg id="2718">The Connecticut helicopter was on display next to a Maine yacht, a Wisconsin fire engine and a Mississippi fork lift truck.</seg>
<seg id="2719">The White House's military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or Frago, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit that is responsible for the operation of the helicopter.</seg>
<seg id="2720">"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with a high visibility," wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event his superior, the Deputy Military Commander for Aviation.</seg>
<seg id="2721">The message showed that the helicopter arrived at 7 o'clock in the morning on the South Lawn for the event at 3 p.m. and until the turf was cleared between 18: 00 and 21: 00 on this evening.</seg>
<seg id="2722">The note adds that if the departure from the White House is delayed, a second team would be required for the return flight due to the restriction of the service hours.</seg>

<seg id="2731">At the event, the president gave an impetus for the reform of the health reform, which was in progress in the Senate and he propagated efforts to constrain government regulations.</seg>

<seg id="2742">A spokesman of Sikorsky said the company had not been involved in putting the helicopter on the South Lawn.</seg>
<seg id="2743">HMX-1 does not maintain budget labels for the presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.</seg>

<seg id="2745">Records of the unit recorded the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.</seg>

<seg id="2750">At that time the former spokesman of the White House, Sean Spicer, defended the deployment of the helicopter for the event.</seg>

<seg id="2864">The page of La League may regret its interest in Marco Verratti</seg>
<seg id="2865">Paris Saint-Germain will not abandon Neymar's persecution following an offer of £189 million to release its release clause, but have they warned Barcelona three years ago before the world record?</seg>
<seg id="2866">The sensational approach has heated the transfer window in summer, because the League 1 club is ready to beat the world record by more than double the previous mark, with Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United last season for 89 million pounds.</seg>
<seg id="2867">After finishing, Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the world's highest paid professional athlete. PSG offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week.</seg>
<seg id="2868">Barcelona is furious about the way Neymar has forced his way outside, although a source near the Catalans Board insisted that the club always did his best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="2869">But was the football world warned three years ago by the PSG President before this prospect?</seg>
<seg id="2870">When Manchester City expressed interest in the signing of Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for each club, which wanted to sign one of the best players of PSG.</seg>
<seg id="2871">"I'm not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players, we will stand in opposition to them, we will contact their players," said Al-Khelaifi.</seg>

<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen report on the misuse cases relieves Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">That means author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen provides further discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement "Wir sind Kirche," declared after publication in relation to the German press agency, he acquired an apology from the former Regensburg bishop and present Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as by the Cathedral Choir Master Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emerized Pope Benedict XVI.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would serve the prestige of the Catholic Church when Müller and Ratzinger express their deep regret about their own layoffs or their false appraisal of the proceedings at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"" "the Vatican newspaper" "" "Osservatore Romano" "", "on the other hand, criticised that in reporting about violence in the domain cats, it was measured with" "" "two measures." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">In regard to the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubts that it is "shameful and shameful deeds," which would have to be punishable and prevented in the future; however, the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the National Italian Bioethics Committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "the habit of calling the Catholic Church as the source of all evil is already part of everyday life and prepares public opinion to keep it normal," "" "writes Scaraffia." ""</seg>
<seg id="2897">Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis said in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk: "you like to go to the church and this is a found fresco."</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "she also pointed out that in her youth" "" "putts have been a quite normal educational tool" "" "to be done with cheeky children, as I was one." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">They found it unfair to apply today's standards to earlier decades, as the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports about misuse cases, pope-brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Author and historian Michael Hesemann, who authored Ratzinger, wrote the book "My brother of the Pope" (translated into 12 languages).</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection," says Hesemann, "for all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report.</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is written in the 440-page report presented by the Council of Regensburg, Ulrich Weber, who was commissioned by the diocese of Regensburg?</seg>
<seg id="2904">A total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen (Regensburger Domspatzen) were brutally abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s, "with high plausibility."</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report it was named Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "in summary, it can be said that in many cases Domkapellmeister was used in many cases of physical and psychological violence.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially with high emotionality, the punishment for the students was even more violent.</seg>
<seg id="2907">In contrast to many other accused, however, many victims rated the general humanity of R. and, in many cases, even have positive memories of him. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal of the Regensburger Domspatzen (Georg Ratzinger) is relieved of his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">"" "Mr Hesemann, the 440-page report on the" "" "Violation of Violence in Protected Sites at the Regensburger Domspatzen" "" "gives a contradictory picture of Georg Ratzinger Cathedral Choir." ""</seg>
<seg id="2910">On the one hand, many students emphasize their "humanity."</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, he also appears as choleric and perfectionist, who became tangible to the latter, when a Domspatz had no top performance musically.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long story from the front to the back, you have to ask why the name Georg Ratzinger is common at all.</seg>
<seg id="2914">He is currently dedicated to eight pages and is clearly exempted from any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The violence in the pre-school also occurred outside of its sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">At best, one can reproach it, experience it too late or have taken first hints not seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"" "the Domspatzengymnasium, on which he worked, was perceived by virtually all respondents as" "" "redemption," "" "" heaven "" "" and "" "" better world. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2918">This is how the vast majority of Georg Ratzinger's students have a very excellent certificate, "sincerely," "sincere," "sincere," "honest," "competent" and "understanding," as an extremely good-natured teacher who regularly provided the boys with cakes, biscuits and candy and "always surrounded by grapes of children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complains about its perfectionism and its high emotionality, which also led to flood breaks.</seg>
<seg id="2920">The fact that he did not only knead with chairs and threw the keyring on the ground, but also drawn ear-cowards and overturned cheeky guys on the hair or ears, he had already admitted years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it.</seg>
<seg id="2921">To its salvation, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the time, the 1960s and 1970s, in both parents and teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you still know such methods of breeding?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everyone of us who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also experienced this in a secular school, a state grammar school.</seg>
<seg id="2925">However, compared to what it actually deals with in this report, namely, the horrific sexual abuse and the violence excesses at the preschool, these are indeed bagatelles.</seg>
<seg id="2926">One wonders whether it is not about his fame and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI that many media rushed straight on him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">In the Bavarian pope many, who have never understood Him, still work eagerly.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">The media reported a great deal of abuse during the Regensburger Domspatzen affair in connection with the report.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger responsible in the final report any involvement or complicity with regard to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: no, no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not one of 67 victims of sexual assault is claiming to have become familiar with the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were initiated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I never dared to talk about it with my father or mother," "" "said one of those affected," "" "It was all very embarrassing to me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem with the explanation of sexual abuse was and is, however, that most of the victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they didn't even entrust themselves to parents and siblings, certainly not a choral conductor, who, professionally, would have been a colleague of the culprits.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the cats of the Domspitz play Ratzinger's role in regard to misuse cases?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionable student formulated it so: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) would have had timely insights and could have stopped the respective perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I think it... even for really absurd to assume that it is calculated to him... bubbles intrusive or clearer or even more opened than in front of their parents, dormitory managers, teachers of trust, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That you talk about sex with him... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "this concludes the report on the very clear result:" "" "it could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation that affected students and / or their environment were entrusted to him." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">As for sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is thus acquitted of all co-existence.</seg>
<seg id="2943">So it cannot be accused of having prevented or displaying it.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore there is no reason to connect his good name to these vile crimes, as unfortunately occurred in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "in the media there was much to read about" "" "Violence-Violence" "" "at the Regensburger Domspatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">"" "the former cathedral master Georg Ratzinger is accused of" "" "looking away" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: that's the big problem that everything is mixed and mixed in the reporting to a huge amount of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, right in the middle of Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this is precisely the misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Namely, there is a clean separation: between the pre-school and the high school of the domain sparrows, between sexual abuse and violence, and, let us say, other accusations.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945, so also for four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not Chief of the Cathedral Treasury.</seg>
<seg id="2952">All the horrible test pedagogy, the cases in which boys of sadist teachers were scrambled and portrayed and dreamed of them, took place at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where there were really scandalous conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with them, Domkapellmeister had nothing to do with Georg Ratzinger, because he got the boys first to face when they were already on the Domspatzengymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">On this, as most witnesses emphasise, the topic of "pre-school" taboo.</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradisiacal" conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different at the Domspatzengymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was discipline, but no sadistic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">"" "and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that" "" "many victims rated the general humanity of R. and, in many cases, even combine positive memories with him." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2959">At most, the accusation remains to be taken away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre-school.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71, when he just started to establish himself and was responsible for the events at a school where he was not working and responsible, (as the witness) did not want to hear, and then back to 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger resolutely shut the ears in front of the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the domain gymnasium, which the report even reproduces.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "in this he points out that" "" "in the preparatory school, the punishment will continue to be practiced." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">In view of the danger of negative press releases, it recommended urgent intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity was, as test punishments were banned long ago in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that, they happened in a legal grey area, as each of us probably knows.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was also difficult for him to assess where the affected persons might be exaggerated or dramatized and where really the permissible limit was exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can't say he always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">That's just not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 the punishment of schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis maintained that it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards to that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"" "Michael Hesemann:" "" "we historians speak of the" "" "fallacy of anachronism" "", "i.e. the danger of judging the past according to today's moral standards." ""</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess has already been right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this, of course, does not apply to sexual abuse, which at all times was abominable and also not for what was broken in the preschool of adversity and violence against innocent children's souls, that goes far beyond what happened at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2977">That's all very awful and I'm glad that it will finally be worked up.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means of disciplining and punishing, i.e. drawing ear-cowards and in the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment was then banned, he kept strictly adhering to it.</seg>
<seg id="2981">"" "what picture of his Regensburg time has Georg Ratzinger reproduced in the talks with you for the book" "" "My Brother of the Pope" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2982">Was the subject of test punishment also available?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it's about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI., from his perspective, the domain sparrows only played a minor role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I did not deviate from the fact that he was conducting a strict regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But this must be said once: without this perfectionism, without demanding discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world-rank, true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and candy alone you don't even make a big singer and stand before every success, whatever area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people did you see Georg Ratzinger in talking about her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and in addition, I met Georg Ratzinger very well and again and again experienced a wonderful, humorous, very good-hearted, deeply believer and heart-good man, from which one can't imagine that he could only hurt a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Today, 23 years after his emeritierung, I get regular contact with him, visit him, read it - he's almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who have not yet forgiven him that he was once strict with them, are thus clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the domain spars are thankful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he is always a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovable disrespect, to which they still look up today and which they virtually revere.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, once again quite clearly: all that you are accused of are educational methods that were on the agenda at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be happy that we have long overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is highly unjust, a man just because he is prominently and has an even more prominent brother to make a medial scapegoat.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the evil intent behind it, only too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The report, which has just been published, relieves it.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the insurrection would command a 93-year-old man who has acquired great merits and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany probably nobody would know the Regensburger Domspatzen, at last in peace.</seg>
