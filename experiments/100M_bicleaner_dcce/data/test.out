28 @-@ year @-@ old cook found dead in San Francisco Mall
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old chef , who recently moved to San Francisco , was found dead in the stair@@ well of a local shopping centre .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the victim &apos;s brother said he could not imagine anyone who would harm him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally it went up with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cor@@ p@@ se , found on Wednesday morning in the West@@ field Mall , was identified as the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Frank Gali@@ cia from San Francisco , distributed the judi@@ ci@@ ary medical department in San Francisco .
the San Francisco Police Department said death was clas@@ sed as murder and the investigations are underway .
the victim &apos;s brother Louis Gali@@ cia informed the ABS station K@@ GO in San Francisco that Frank , who previously worked as a cook in Boston , had his dream job as a cook in the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters Restaurant in San Francisco six months ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man for the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shocked and destroyed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about his death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a small team working like a tight family and we will miss him pain@@ fully , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our thoughts and con@@ dol@@ ences are at this difficult time with Fran@@ ks &apos;s family and friends .
Louis Gali@@ cia admitted that Frank lived initially in Host@@ els , but that &quot; things went up for him . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he found an apartment , he had a friend , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Louis Gali@@ cia told him that he could not imagine anyone who would hurt his younger brother .
he was a friendly person with a big heart .
to combine his family with his family was to cook us always something to prepare dinner , &quot; Louis Gali@@ cia said .
he never wanted to take part in any kind of confrontation .
he was the brother who sw@@ am with the river .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in everything that goes wrong in the world , he was this un@@ polished diamond that sh@@ ined brigh@@ tly every day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyone who has information about the case is requested to call the fax number 4@@ 15 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m always stuck in drawers
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston must not always be perfect or successful .
the Hollywood star in an interview is now unmistak@@ ably clear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m always stuck in drawers or glued onto the outside label which usually has little to do with me and the reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have the desire to always be perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; to be honest , these things are rather dum@@ b . &quot;
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about it as &quot; Miss Perfect , &quot; as explained in the current &quot; Cos@@ mop@@ olitan . &quot;
the act@@ ress likes to spend her time at home , in front of a television with loose de@@ bris and Mexican food , it &apos;s the name of the magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she asked the question of the desire for children : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we women don &apos;t have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Hollywood star . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in her new film Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a child &apos;s play , &quot; Ani@@ ston is seen as a single mother of two sons .
the film runs on 25th August .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the sports pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ a@@ geable .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Lan@@ ger visited with some colleagues a bit of di@@ version with a ride on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden sports pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes the horses remembered their celebrations , they drove home to the feed @-@ trou@@ ghs in a fast gal@@ lo@@ p .
one kilometer at this pace , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; Lan@@ ger says .
and so the riding career ended again .
on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer was - 101 tournament wins - again near horses .
he let his family run over the plant of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he didn &apos;t even swear to photographs .
this was the first time in Aachen and there@@ with also at CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German Sports Aid handed the man from Schaff@@ hausen within the framework of a small gala the Golden Ath@@ le@@ en Pyr@@ amid .
there is no lack of awards to the li@@ ke@@ able ath@@ lete .
Federal Cross of Mer@@ it , silver bay leaf , Champions Tour Player of the Year ...
even the Queen of Britain has already rebu@@ ked him .
the 18th prize winner of the sports pyramid is long .
in Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for it is not only awarded for sporty successes but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for decades , Lan@@ ger has promoted offspring .
and so he also announced the prize money of 25,000 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with 15 other outstanding sports@@ men , the double US master winner was added to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hall of F@@ ame des deutschen Sport &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the winners include the athletes Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Tur@@ ner Eber@@ hard Gi@@ er , the founder of Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the young rider Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the jumping disc Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um der Hand@@ b@@ aller Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich .
many of these sports legends have come to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company moved to the Spring@@ sta@@ dion where the Lav@@ azza price was running .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ tons and Tr@@ um@@ ps economic policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
invest in infrastructure and prevent T@@ TP trade deal - both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
however , the two U.S. Pres@@ idential candidates are un@@ divided in tax and energy policy as well as in a basic question .
differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and H@@ illary Clinton constitute a fundamental , rather philosophical difference .
the role of the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump wants to keep those in doubt rather small and warns against how the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton wants to control the economy to death and to regulate death , he says .
he himself would be quite different , says Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will mas@@ sively reverse the regulations and he will be strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for businesses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton , on the other hand , says , &quot; The state has certain tasks to fulfil , it has opportunities to open to dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money for it .
that is why taxes for the rich would be increased , they say .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic of infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in that need to be invested , pump and Clinton say almost immediately . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the democratic candidate is even announc@@ ing the largest investment in new jobs since World War II .
state investment programs in the infrastructure are classic democratic politics and are strictly rejected by the state @-@ critical budget of the Republi@@ cans .
so there could still be internal discussions on Tr@@ ump .
significant are the differences in energy and climate policies .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and drive up coal mining in the USA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas , it wants to cancel the Paris climate protection agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton , on the other hand , intends to expand and demand renew@@ ables with its investment programme : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a country will become the super power of clean energy and create millions jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only in the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other .
both T@@ PP , the tran@@ spa@@ zi@@ ed trade agreement , do not want to sign both .
at the same time , both , however , do not want to isol@@ ate the United States from international trade - but simply only to better protect American jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they should then be paid better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Clinton . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the present minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a star@@ vation wage .
it wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour .
what Tr@@ ump does want to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says , the minimum wage has to come up , then he says he must not be changed .
but the big discussion of the coming months would probably be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
on the one hand Tr@@ ump is standing , who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth .
his critics believe that the budget deficit would be even greater .
on the other hand , Clinton stands at least asking the rich to pay more taxes , and whose critics say : more taxes are not the solution either .
&quot; &quot; &quot; escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every fled woman has experience with sexual violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual violence belongs almost to everyday life for women who are fle@@ eing alone .
when they arrive in Germany , they are often traumati@@ zed .
a house provides refuge .
there are four women sitting in a large kitchen .
each one has a baby at most a year old .
she laid her little son in her arms .
he looks curi@@ ously into the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es on the tab@@ let@@ op .
until she notices that she is being watched .
she s@@ miles briefly and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until you speak with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is the managing director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a sponsor of social assistance services in Bavaria , and deals among other things with the topic of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are refugees .
they live in Munich north in one of the few de@@ centralized accommodations for single @-@ fle@@ dged women and their children in Bavaria .
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs set up the establishment together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich Women &apos;s Aid .
she has been officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - neither as visitors .
the exception is a guard at the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has experiences on her escape with sexual violence , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men are fle@@ eing because they are persecuted politically because they thre@@ aten the torture or death , or because their families send them to Europe as hope @-@ makers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in women there are other reasons for the escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many steal away secretly , because they see no other way out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they have experience in their homeland with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , fre@@ edoms , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
this is driving them away .
on the run , this goes on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , tu@@ gs for a bottle of water demand a sexual act is not a r@@ arity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
who think that when they anchor in Germany , B@@ ahr rec@@ alls .
here too , single women in refugee camps would often be deemed to be inferior and ab@@ used in the worst case .
this means that about 90 per cent of women living in the north @-@ east of Munich are traumati@@ zed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children were certainly not voluntarily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are used to the fact that they don &apos;t say anything .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they do not dare to talk openly about the experience , because shame is too great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often don &apos;t know how to help , there are more accommodations for them , says B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria the seven District Govern@@ ments are responsible for the housing of refugees .
on the question of whether they knew about a similar project as in Munich in their area of jurisdiction , some answer with no .
there is no such thing in the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia .
also in Sw@@ ab@@ ia , fle@@ dged women are not accommod@@ ated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokes@@ man of the government .
in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Central Fran@@ con@@ ia there are floors or own houses only for single women and their children .
the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rights of Women and Gender E@@ quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women to be separated from men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the committee it is said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women be accommod@@ ated separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the privacy is missing , men and women are accommod@@ ated together , there can be - perpet@@ ual violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the wash@@ rooms should be separated and easily accessible for women , is in the study .
how much the women feel this need of protection can be read off the crowds that it gives to the house in Munich .
&quot; since it has been around for us , we have a long waiting list , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
you could easily make a second home .
assistant doctors strike : demands for new work campaign measures
representatives of the assistance personnel have called on their union to appro@@ ve new work campaign measures in their disputes with respect to a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( B@@ MA ) has called for its entire Council to appro@@ ve more working conditions from the beginning of September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the J@@ DC said that ministers had been det@@ ained to enter into the concerns of the Treaty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in July , assistance personnel and medical students have agreed on the rejection of a contract agreed with the B@@ MA .
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in the elections .
in a letter to the members , who was published on Twitter on Thursday evening , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government had remained obst@@ inate &quot; to problems , which led to the rejection of the contract .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of this , the J@@ DC Board agreed to fully reject the proposed new contract and request official new negotiations on all your concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Board today submitted a formal request to a special meeting of the B@@ MA Council to appro@@ ve a running program of escal@@ ating work campaign measures beginning in September .
the dispute caused assistance physicians to strike six times this year , the first total out@@ ages in the history of the N@@ HS .
the director of B@@ MA assistance personnel , Dr. Johann Mal@@ av@@ ana , res@@ ig@@ ned after the election to reject the agreed contractual conditions recommended by the B@@ MA .
he shared B@@ MA members during the sessions which were attended by 5@@ 4.000 assistance physicians and medical students before the vote , that the contract should be beneficial and should be accepted .
after the vote , Health Minister Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t said that the contract for doctors in England would be compulsory .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; Alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to hand over their hands and announced an official end to the eight @-@ month war of the words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin takes receipt of his Turkish counter@@ part in the gil@@ ded hall of the St. Petersburg Palace , I can &apos;t resist the impression that Ankara would most want this reconciliation .
there was a hand@@ shake , yes .
but Putin &apos;s smile seemed to be dirty and he barely radi@@ ated heat , even for his re@@ taining relations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , spoke of his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dear friend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin - according to a report whole five times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even improve .
the next day a newspaper described that Erdo@@ gan could have beha@@ ved like never anything bad happened .
to me , his enthusiasm seemed to suggest the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s em@@ itting , sustainable bol@@ dness showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had not forgotten anything .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory words : the firing of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was rage @-@ bla@@ zing .
Putin den@@ ounced and accused Ankara of having fallen back on Russia .
the offen@@ se was even greater as it was committed by a supposed friend .
building up the v@@ eto@@ fore will be difficult , if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , the state @-@ controlled media made a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
suddenly it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything .
the serious accus@@ ations of senior officials were that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family benefited from illegal oil trade in Syria &apos;s areas controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he has denied this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
but in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look ahead .
after all , this meeting was held only because Putin received the excuse that he wanted to hear from President Erdo@@ gan .
Russia could book a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ ase@@ fire are obvious .
Erdo@@ gan first and foremost needs all the friends he can get after he was reli@@ eved of his office in a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat in the last month .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year .
the number decreased by almost 90 % .
in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when flights are resum@@ ed .
they count on a late @-@ season rush to the Mediterranean .
this week , the state television forecast cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ dem@@ sti formul@@ ates it as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is fur@@ ious at the West as its response to the attempted tak@@ eover of power considered a weak response .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the continued anger on the sn@@ ail emp@@ ires of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is eager to take advantage of the cool mood and reduce Turkey &apos;s relationship to the West . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Russian head of state won in Ankara with security a bonus that he called for support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
this is a matter of course for Moscow , which itself has a deep fear of regime change .
the summit in this splendid palace by the sea made it possible for Russia and Turkey to represent an &quot; Alliance of out@@ si@@ ders , &quot; as an analy@@ st once described to me : two countries that viol@@ ate themselves from the West and are badly treated and now unite .
nevertheless , in spite of the public atonement , there are still great differences between the two .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently played the role as a peac@@ emaker , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides .
it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks , both pres@@ idents spoke at the press conference that they hadn &apos;t even touched the subject .
the President of Turkey intentionally refra@@ ined from answering a question about their differences , while Putin decided to emphas@@ ise this .
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and in the face of the potential for a perfect disaster , when NATO member Turkey swe@@ pt the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state speak at least once again .
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available to customers outside Scotland
according to the Management Board of the Bank , the R@@ BS brand will only be reduced to a back office role .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan told the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
since then , the Bank has dist@@ anced itself since it had to be collap@@ sed and saved almost eight years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at this time , brand strate@@ gi@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have used to protect other end @-@ consumer brands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsor@@ ing , from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now it has decided to put more national brands into focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the de@@ centralized head office and stock exchange listing will change to Nat@@ West .
the brand Ul@@ ster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other smaller brands for retail , which will be more important - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brand RS@@ B will become our investor brand as well as the brand under which our employees will be employed as we are now becoming a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the Bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say now that we do not pursue global goals , but local goals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
each of these brands will be completely different in their own congregations and our employees will work with the customers under these brands .
R@@ BS has already said that it will not be able to continue its Six Nations Sponsor@@ ing and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the different brands in its sports sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s time for us to develop into the bank of brands , as how do we focus on the inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the CEO . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and would have launched these brands .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes .
we can launch these brands again , so I think the time has come .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori reaches his 3,@@ 000@@ th win at New@@ market on Pre@@ dil@@ ection
D@@ ett@@ ori spra@@ ys champagne after a double with New@@ market , bringing him 3,@@ 000@@ th win
jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori assured his 3,@@ 000@@ th British win at New@@ market on Friday .
he set a milestone on Pre@@ dil@@ ection , trained by John Gos@@ den , on his local race track with his second win of the night .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey who reached the milestone in the flat race .
he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son .
the three @-@ time winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who in front of G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar won , said : &quot; it &apos;s something special . &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is also here
I am very happy that it happened in New@@ market because I landed here 30 years ago .
it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a mund@@ ane Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes up the che@@ er when he wins the victory on Pre@@ dil@@ ection
two jo@@ ck@@ eys reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who achieved more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a record breaking career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time der@@ by@@ si@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career steps
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of Moder@@ nis@@ m and it is no surprise that he reached this milestone , which only few reached before him .
he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intell@@ ect that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charism@@ a fans thri@@ lled fans for years for this sport .
I said Frank@@ ie some weeks ago at Ep@@ som , that he had already collected 6.000 wins if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and grand@@ stand jo@@ ckey !
Frank@@ ie has already made nearly 30 years of winners in the UK , which is great .
he has a vibrant personality , which is good for a British race , but beyond that he is an incredible jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flagship of the British flat race for two decades .
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
a whole series of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; Gl@@ or@@ ous Seven &quot; in 1996 at As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and got a ban on drugs .
three years ago , he had difficulties at the beginning when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive character of his character to def@@ y his doub@@ ters and return to his bur@@ ial .
and he hasn &apos;t come to an end for a long time - D@@ ett@@ ori has once said that he wants to continue with competitions up to his age of at least 5 years .
Russian President Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov &apos;s Chief of Staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin un@@ expect@@ edly released his Chief of Staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was part of the stric@@ test confidence @-@ circle of Putin for many years .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old has been appointed special representative for environmental and transport affairs .
in a statement by the Krem@@ lin , it is stated that without stating grounds , Putin has ordered the dis@@ mis@@ sal of Ivan@@ ov@@ s from his duties as chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration . &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who had been his deputy since 2012 , was named his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in Tall@@ inn , Estonia in 1972 , he graduated from the prestigious State Moscow Institute of International Relations ( M@@ GI@@ MO ) and worked in the Tokyo Embassy .
on the Krem@@ lin website , it is said ( in Russian ) that he later was the chief of the government and Chief of Staff of the Government College .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is the government &apos;s main task to support your work as Head of State on bills and controls to implement your instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
are the smiling faces convincing ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of Vladimir Putin &apos;s closest confi@@ dant and worked as he was for the Soviet Intelligence Service , the K@@ GB .
as chief of staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin , which was broad@@ cast@@ ed on television , both men asser@@ ted that the Chief of Staff will come back at his own request .
but despite the smile for the cameras , only a few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
so , is the result of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows that at this time .
but the official asser@@ tion that a man who once was praised as a potential president once again would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - met with great skep@@ ticism .
in his remarks to Putin , quoted on the Krem@@ lin website , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 - you could almost say - to entr@@ ust my posts for four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration for four years and eight months .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V took the post in December 2011 .
prior to that , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and , like Putin , former member of the K@@ GB State Security Service .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was President of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his deputy .
when Putin came to power , he named Ivan@@ ov as one of five people whom he trusted most .
it was once assumed that Ivan@@ ov could become President of Russia after Putin &apos;s second term , as a third term of Putin would have viol@@ ated the constitution .
but this post was taken by another , close ally of Putin , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became Prime Minister before he became the President three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he hit producers
Gib@@ son was involved in a physical examination at the set of the Los Angeles series last month .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios that produce the series announced his dis@@ mis@@ sal in a joint statement .
Gib@@ son , who played the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ host , publicly ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the announcement of his dis@@ mis@@ sal on Thursday .
on the set there came artistic differences and differences of opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details on how the character Gi@@ bs@@ ons from the series , which follows a team of FB@@ I agents , is written out , according to the opinion of ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios is expected to be published at a later date .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old who previously played in the Sit@@ com D@@ har@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g has been involved since the first season of the series in 2005 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I love Criminal Min@@ ds and have put my whole heart blood in the last twelve years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gib@@ son in a release published on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I had hoped to be there until the end , but it won &apos;t be possible now .
I would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans you could wish for a series .
the scheduled broadcast of the twel@@ fth season will be scheduled for 28 September .
puzzles for fish that landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
a resident of Ban@@ ff demanded help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks that the 75 Pis@@ ces could be Sand@@ als , which were sp@@ iced out by a fountain .
Mr B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , published on Per@@ is@@ cope a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish .
Que@@ ens@@ land Crossing : bridge now connected to Fi@@ fe
the project is expected to be completed by May 2017 .
engineers have connected the north deck of Que@@ ens@@ land cross@@ ings to the vi@@ a@@ duct - which means that the bridge is now connected with fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four se@@ al@@ ings of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ceiling fan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approaching the completion around each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 slan@@ ted ropes .
the project is expected to be completed by May 2017 .
Minister of Economy Kei@@ th Brown made a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is a historical and symbolic moment in the construction of the Que@@ ens@@ land cross@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all the witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic scale in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the closure between the vi@@ a@@ duct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for fit .
in total , almost 79 % of the total bridge deck is in place and the last section of the deck is given a concrete fire for the deck today in Ros@@ y@@ th , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Martin , project manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first closure is a significant milestone in every bridge project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this fantastic project represents the closure of the tr@@ end@@ setting and civil engineering .
after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the north tower on the north , we had to close the existing gap on the north or the north side .
this was reached by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters to the south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
mas@@ sively because the vi@@ a@@ duct is 2@@ 22 metres long , weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be drag@@ ged upwards at an incline of about 3 % .
because the tolerances on which the team were working were tiny - on each side they were just a few milli@@ metres .
fortunately everything went very well .
rescue at the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men are lucky to be alive &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lucky to be alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after fishing from fishing boat in front of Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station sounded the alarm on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T after a crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulty swimming in safety while their boat moved out of their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw the boat rolling around and set the worst before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luckily the strong winds have already blown the boat out of their reach , until we left the water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were res@@ cu@@ ed by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and found on a bu@@ o@@ y without a life@@ jacket .
they all came aboard the coastal rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Jones : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men who were thrown into the water are lucky to be un@@ har@@ med and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bo@@ ating engine had a stop@@ gap , but it loos@@ ened away from the person who ste@@ ered the boat .
someone has now awak@@ ened over these men today .
seriously injured - man pi@@ cks up his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and badly injured .
as the police ha@@ st@@ ened yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had the key to the apartment to get his personal things .
instead , the alcoholic perpet@@ r@@ ator cut the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend .
when she came to the apartment , he stab@@ bed her two times .
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured at the hand and on the body .
the police could arrest the perpet@@ r@@ ator .
while the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed his ex @-@ girlfriend &apos;s clothing , he called his mother .
this then al@@ armed his sister .
together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother .
but she could not move him to leave the apartment .
so she went out of the house with her partner .
on the street she met the husband &apos;s ex @-@ wife .
when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old pushed his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend .
who can build favourable apartments in Braunschweig ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and Gre@@ ens mean : investors should be put much stronger in their duty in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do you react to the bad news that Brun@@ swi@@ ck will lose almost 1300 inexpensive dwell@@ ings over the next few years ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD suggests a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; housing concept for housing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the next council meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but stri@@ fe is programmed .
first of all , the question is : who should build the cheap apartments ?
so far there is no provision .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D Group president Christopher Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : if you want to build on urban areas , in future , 20 percent of all apartments must be classified as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cheap apartments can , however , also arise in the continu@@ ance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the major point of conten@@ tion in the town hall is , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How do you deal with investors who want to build on private land ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors on such areas to build at least 10 percent , but as much as 20 percent of homes as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new urban housing promotion program , which will cost millions and still needs to be financed , should ensure incentives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the problem , says Brat@@ man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; There is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U would like to make investors as few rules as possible .
the left wants to impose tough@@ er constraints on investors .
despite this , as Brat@@ st@@ mann , there is a tigh@@ tening of the situation on the housing market .
if the concept of action is implemented , it will provide additional tasks in the construction management .
more staff is needed .
it is not clear whether we will get skilled workers .
but the programme is not yet complete : the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway .
but how do you reconci@@ le the loss of more around 1300 inexpensive dwell@@ ings , whose funding will exp@@ ire in the coming years ?
by 2020 , there will be 500 apartments .
in order to prevent this , the planning policy spokesperson Nicole Palm , should now be purchased from the city .
in addition , it would have to be thought to get apartments back into price binding .
this is possible in the West@@ stadt .
at one stroke the problem could be solved .
for in the West@@ stadt , Fri@@ sten is running at the end of the year .
around 1800 flats can be brought back to the price binding for cheap apartments .
only : these are the owners , the housing companies do not want .
because the number of social housing in the West@@ stadt is dras@@ tically increased again , it is removed from the goal of the so @-@ called mixing .
there should be no concentration of socially dis@@ advant@@ aged in just a few districts .
the Gre@@ ens reck@@ on that there will still be movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Group president Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a wide majority the CD@@ U must go into the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have concentrated on more building sites for single @-@ family homes .
but what does not mean that a compromise can not be found .
Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that is worth it
it is fascinating to see how the world is changing .
the fact that teenagers and children no longer go outside , but rather prefer spending their free time on screens , has been lam@@ ented by many in the last decade .
Po@@ k@@ emon Go is about getting people from the sofa and becoming more active .
the time on the screen was initially limited to TV , then video games and most recently on smartphones .
it is therefore great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive .
of course I refer to the Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on the characters created initially for video games in the 1990s ( later arose a carto@@ on series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) .
like many phenomena of pop culture , interest before the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand declined in early July .
the market launch in other countries was offset by the massive demand that over@@ loaded the servers .
within a few days , Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , the players go outside with their smartphones and look for Po@@ k@@ é@@ m@@ ons , which are tra@@ cked with a GPS and , once they have been found , can be &quot; photograph@@ ed &quot; ( using a screen@@ shot on the phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the del@@ usion and j@@ umped for the sofa .
in the United States , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that reflect the &quot; average &quot; person every day .
Car@@ di@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , who tra@@ cked 35@@ ,000 users , announced the Washington Post recently that within two days of the launch of the game , the number of follow @-@ up people , who train every day 30 minutes , j@@ umped from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company does not know who is playing Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go - it merely sees raw data to increase performance .
a lot of public health awareness campaigns that people want to &quot; take 30 minutes time &quot; to &quot; come down from the sofa &quot; and &quot; being active every day , &quot; stum@@ bled on de@@ af ears because many public messages are boring and come from people who look el@@ ly .
nevertheless , the importance of sport cannot be over@@ valued .
those who do sports regularly reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to guide them here .
but the miracle of Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoor that is fun for them .
thus three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
some people even make new friend@@ ships at the hunt .
as always , there are gr@@ ump@@ y playing spo@@ ils that always have to complain about something .
and yes , someone could run against a door .
what &apos;s it ?
a breakthrough happened .
even if Smartphone @-@ Apps like Fit@@ bit could track our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to do sport as this game does .
the new will lose its appeal and the use will fade with time .
however , due to Po@@ k@@ em@@ ons &apos;s success , there will be more games , combining apps and virtual reality with the assets in the real world , helping many people on the hunt to be more active , more active and heal@@ thier .

Sim@@ one Bil@@ es creates gold in the Dam@@ entur@@ nen
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Sim@@ one Bil@@ es is immune to all this .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
eff@@ or@@ tless on the beam .
breathtaking on the ground .
on a whole line brilliant .
and now finally an Olympic champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast made a multi @-@ campaign title on Thursday and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world before all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
her total score of 6@@ 2,@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly before the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; team winner A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze med@@ alli@@ st Ali@@ ya Must@@ afa .
the American women Sim@@ one Bil@@ es tur@@ mo@@ cks on the hanging bar during the solo multi @-@ fight event of women at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American , who wins a multi @-@ battle title , and in total the fifth while holding her call to be the best of her generation or even at all .
she burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey ended at that moment .
this success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps , who brought her sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es has dominated the last three years of her sport , 15 World Championship med@@ als - including 10 gold med@@ als - with so amazing exercises that include a blend of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Res@@ cue from her said that she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
it was expecting a final test in Brazil , a competition which was not so much between the balance and the rest of the athletes , but rather between it and a burden of over@@ sized expectations .
not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be regarded as disappointment .
the Americans Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace each other after winning gold and silver in the single multi @-@ battle array of women at the Olympic Summer Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday
Bil@@ es took the first medal on Tuesday , while she served as ex@@ clamation mark at the f@@ arewell party of retired Co @-@ ordin@@ ator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i .
although Bil@@ es insist@@ ed , during its long path to the top , never planned the future , it is not really true .
part of her floor exercises - which contain her typical Tum@@ bling pass - is tuned to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is not a coinci@@ dence .
this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother during a school excursion to the gymn@@ asi@@ um , was trained in the Bo@@ or@@ man .
since the summer of 2013 , she has not lost a multi @-@ camp@@ ground competition , a winning stre@@ ak that will hold as long as Bil@@ es wishes .
even if Must@@ afa was easy through two turns , the picture was dec@@ ep@@ tive .
floating beams and ground tubes - in which Bil@@ es holds the world title - lau@@ ded .
she recovered again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the floating beam - and sitting on the ground with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground .
Ra@@ is@@ man hu@@ g@@ ged her sof@@ tly when she awa@@ ited her grand@@ stand - a pure form - and tears poured on Bil@@ es shiny red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her collection book became a reality .
the performance of Ra@@ is@@ mans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke went to Must@@ afa .
this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team captain , called O@@ ma by the Americans , had a lead .
after her cultivation , she cast out kis@@ ses to the audience , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , sometimes doub@@ t@@ ful .
as far as Bil@@ es is concerned , the rapidly spreading T@@ we@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ olds has a very new meaning from the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims killed in mass murder while listening to music in the car
according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 year old girl were shot , who died in one of the most le@@ thal attacks for a decade in the first mass murder of Phoenix , while they stopped in the car and listened to music .
Angela Rochelle Liner , Stefanie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12th , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said .
the perpet@@ r@@ ator fired eight shots out of a hand @-@ made fire@@ arm while he was standing on the passenger side of the car and subsequently fled with another vehicle , is read in the report .
the police said that the triple murder does not seem to have been the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y affair , as the aggres@@ sor did not carry the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 that were owned by one of the adult victims .
Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting caused the investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether they are connected to four previous attacks .
in total , seven people were killed in h@@ is@@ panic residential areas within four months and two were injured .
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; shared Howard the K@@ HP@@ O , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month .
it is believed that the suspect has used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ant from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to expose the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized because of her injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on site .
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which resulted in an empty pick @-@ up truck half an hour before the triple murder and from which it was assumed that it was the work of serial killer .
investig@@ ators found cartridge shells and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; mother of a 6 year old with micro@@ cephal@@ y : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it gets better &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ olds , Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother .
but like the f@@ ew@@ est of his retirement , Ed@@ mund has micro@@ cephal@@ y , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to did not know during her pregnancy .
when he came home for the first time , my first thought was that I can &apos;t do that .
I don &apos;t create that .
then I did not let myself go .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what is not right at all -- of course , one has embark@@ ed on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
your husband Vincent and you have been told that Ed@@ mund will never be able to recognize her and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; my first answer to this was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &apos; said Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to .
Ed@@ mund can walk with the help of a walking aid .
Ed@@ mund could neither sit nor craw@@ l up to his third year and he can still not speak .
but he is progres@@ sing slowly .
it can run with support and bike rides .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the sign language Ed@@ mund for &quot; Please sing something in front of me . &quot;
&quot; we teach him sign language , &quot; said Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News .
but it &apos;s not a typical sign language -- she says . Ed@@ mund has invented some signs alone .
micro@@ cephal@@ ia has a my@@ riad of causes : genetic like with Ed@@ mund and infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and progn@@ oses can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to rec@@ alls the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I asked constantly what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t really know .
I haven &apos;t asked for the pro@@ g@@ nosis since a long time , because I don &apos;t expect anyone to really say to me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of babies with birth defects caused by the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
it will be better .
they know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
heavy rainf@@ alls , floo@@ ding gives rise to b@@ ail@@ outs in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi
heavy rainf@@ alls and large floo@@ ding in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to call out the emergency on Friday . it is expected all Saturday with more rainf@@ alls .
numerous rivers in south @-@ east Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi floo@@ ded their banks and threatened with extensive floods after extreme precip@@ itations , reported the National Weather Service .
the governor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards informed that state officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and have already been on the way to the communities involved .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokesperson for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emergency Prepar@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , stated that the requests for flood vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags increased .
Ste@@ ele said that only the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa had claimed ten thousand sand bags .
a flood warning system is used for large parts in the south of Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
the weather service announced that additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area .
in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama a flood warning system was used on Friday , while it was still ra@@ ining in the Mobile field .
the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , both located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , will likely reach record levels over the weekend .
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers could flood many houses near Bat@@ on Rouge .
he also said that a downstream floo@@ ding in Ascension Par@@ ish is a danger as these rivers will flow slowly into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as over the tro@@ dden rivers .
the Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ v River , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level on Friday at 09.@@ 00 already recorded .
rescue teams still dra@@ ined people from flood waters in the Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son districts in the Sou@@ thwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were res@@ cu@@ ed near Glo@@ ster on Friday .
Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house , greatly increased overnight .
he said that another step@@ son who lives nearby would have warned him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we woke up and the water stre@@ amed and stre@@ amed in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my waist .
his wife said Hans@@ ford that she had never seen such a high level of the river in the 48 years in which she lived there .
Hans@@ ford said that he and his family members would have all disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim .
Hans@@ ford said that emergency hel@@ pers would have res@@ cu@@ ed all three in a large military truck and would have brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommod@@ ated until Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the floo@@ ding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quickly spread out &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as there were still severe rainf@@ alls and that the authorities consider ev@@ ac@@ uation procedures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Kr@@ aut@@ mann , an observer in the vicinity of Liv@@ ing@@ stone reported from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches ra@@ ins .
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the ground was considerably wat@@ ered by rainf@@ all since Wednesday .
the authorities stated that heavy rainf@@ alls and road floo@@ ding caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and black@@ out in five school districts .
the C@@ BS subsidiary WW@@ L reported that a co @-@ ordin@@ ate in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa attacked 200 floo@@ ded houses .
the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated into two churches , both now floo@@ ded .
the Head of the Municip@@ ality of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets washed by the floods .
in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond emergency shel@@ ters were set up to house the ev@@ ac@@ uation .
&quot; as soon as the water begins to fall back , they will be able to return to their homes , &quot; he said .
in the town of Ham@@ mond of the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozens of roads were closed due to the floo@@ ding water and sand bags for the residents were provided for taking part , hoping to be able to keep the water from their homes and stores .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last major flood we had was in March , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from city administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Coun@@ t@@ ys said that it ra@@ ined on the Gulf Coast .
according to his information , a handful of houses were reported to have been reported as floo@@ ded on Thursday , but not reported on Friday .
Kei@@ th Tow@@ n@@ son , manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve seen water in places I &apos;ve never seen before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tow@@ n@@ son said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it &apos;s still coming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; sco@@ op@@ ed by bul@@ lets , &quot; survi@@ ves shooting in Philadelphia
the police tells us that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia this week already the second time a 6 year old child was shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
the grand@@ parents indicated that Brown suffered multiple shot injuries , including in the end , leg , arm and abdom@@ en , but that he was at home in his transport to the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did a lot , his little body was qu@@ en@@ ched by bul@@ lets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said his grand@@ mother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z to the station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I just can &apos;t believe it .
the boy &apos;s condition was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the boy &apos;s family told the station that he is expected to recover .
he should have started the first class at a local elementary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
likewise , three men were shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in a critical condition ; the other two victims are in a stable state according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the boy was found on the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old who finds himself in a critical condition , reported to the station .
the other two victims were not in the car and the police were investigating whether there could be among the injured men of the perpet@@ rators .
investig@@ ators told C@@ BS Philadelphia that it seemed to have come to a cross @-@ fire between several sho@@ ot@@ ers .
cartridge shells for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which were trac@@ ed back to various storm @-@ guns , over@@ came the crime scene .
it seems that this has been clearly an ongoing struggle .
on the road , on both sides of the walk@@ way , there were seals .
it seems that there have been several armed fighters who were very active , &quot; said police officer Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di from the police in Philadelphia to the sender .
several houses and vehicles were also hit in the area .
there was no arrest and the police are currently re@@ viewing the surveillance video .
on Tuesday , another 6 year old girl was hit by a cross trainer on her arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of the West O@@ ak Lan@@ e .
she reco@@ vers and the police are still looking for a suspect .
why we need Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
this is what I imagine under the Women &apos;s Olympics in the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that is more than one reason .
first , I have been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant .
and secondly : this team has three gymn@@ as@@ tics , Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who worked for many young girls from other comple@@ xi@@ on .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew@@ ess and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , who is ca@@ tho@@ lic , makes everybody proud .
this team finally reflects the USA .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and His@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years the number one under the female gymn@@ asi@@ um was an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American woman .
last year Sim@@ one and Gab@@ by were # 1 and # 2 .
this shows strength .
at the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprise Olympic champion and America che@@ ered .
now the world was able to witness the incredible achievement of the triple world champion in Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they delivered unexpected but master@@ ful gy@@ ms routines .
on Thursday , Sim@@ one became the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American woman who won gold at an individual multi @-@ campaign event for women .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we experience the top of this sport , but we do not look at the gymn@@ as@@ tics classes all over the country .
Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all beat the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to make it into the Olympic team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Last Five &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because the next Olympic team will have only four gymn@@ asts in the team . furthermore , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the reality is that gymn@@ as@@ tics are a cost@@ lier sport and gymn@@ asts are first and foremost in private sports clubs which are maintained by parents who pay for training , accommodation , clothing , competition and hotel costs ( for trainers and their gymn@@ asts and families ) .
the majority of these gymn@@ asi@@ ums are located in wealthy suburbs , which can support business .
in these clubs the gymn@@ asts receive their entire training and that is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , both trained their athletes since they started gymn@@ as@@ tics .
we have to provide the communities with inn@@ um@@ erable young girls inspired by Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , providing a more affordable and accessible gymn@@ as@@ tics training .
I founded my gymn@@ as@@ tics foundation for 20 years .
at my events we have offered free and affordable gymn@@ as@@ tics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban te@@ ens ( especially black and His@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners .
in September , we will expand to Detroit ( my home town ) to offer high @-@ quality gymn@@ as@@ tics that make the possibility of learning and benef@@ iting from this great Olympic sport .
Tur@@ unen develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determin@@ at@@ eness for the mind .
this combination offers lifel@@ ong benefits to health as well as for academic and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to care for the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thank you Sim@@ one , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this genuine presentation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ en des olymp@@ ic team gol@@ ds and thank you that you are motiv@@ ating so many young girls with different backgrounds to get their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women .
s &amp; Ds want to organise other strikes after rej@@ ecting Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts &apos;s proposal
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute on the changes by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 37@@ ,000 assistants who voted in favour rejected him .
in July Hun@@ t had revealed plans to introduce the treaty and said that the N@@ HS was in a &quot; ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; and any further delay would be harmful to the employees and patients .
the first assistance personnel should receive a new contract , which includes changes to night and weekend trips to improve maintenance during normal times .
Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , Chairman of the B@@ MA Committee for Assistance Dog@@ s , announced last night in a communication : &quot; assistance specialists have still raised serious concerns about the proposed contract , in particular that it will heat up the current crisis and it will be given to treat all doctors . &quot;
with only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and the time runs out .
efforts on the part of the B@@ MA to resolve disputes with the government to engage in conflict with the government and sometimes on de@@ af@@ ening silence .
this was done by a promise that Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t had made over the last month that his door would always be open .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t has to act now to raise awareness and address the concerns of the assistance personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he does not do this , the doctors have made it clear that they are willing to carry out further work campaigns . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last strike at the end of April saw a delay of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and specialists were included to cover doctors on the strike chain cover .
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute on the changes by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association .
the B@@ MA wants a better week of the week for the 5@@ 4.000 assistance physicians who are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director General of the N@@ HS employees , asked the assistant doctors to stop the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; labor combat measures reach nothing of a little , but have already poll@@ uted teams and service providers and are worried only of care , distress and dis@@ ruption to patients , car@@ egi@@ vers and their families . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
over the past two months , we talked to the Committee of Assistance Dog@@ s and responded positively to the concerns about guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship and whi@@ st@@ leb@@ ings with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries .
employers hoped that continued positive engagement on other important topics - such as des@@ patch , flexibility in training , additional training for those who return from a vocational training , training comfort , mutual recognition of curriculum , training holidays and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how seriously it was the employers , Health Education England and the Ministry of Health related to the observ@@ ance of the agreements with the B@@ MA in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ per day drug that can lower heart attack risk
thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day drug after being advised by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time .
the anti @-@ smoking drug T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
the drug is administered for 12 months following a heart attack , thereby reducing the risk of stroke or other heart attack .
the N@@ HS regulation agency recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ HS regulation agency recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
around 14@@ 0,000 people suffer from a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer from a further heart attack or stroke .
heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty materials in the ar@@ tery walls that form plaque .
when the covering breaks apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots , which con@@ j@@ ures blood flow to the heart and thereby causes a heart attack .
when the blood cl@@ ots triggers , it can flow through the blood stream and clo@@ g the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
persons who have already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk to have another .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and marketed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots unlikely .
the draft of N@@ ICE , published today , recommends a 12 month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Health Care Evaluation Center , said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
experience shows that in combination with aspir@@ in , T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is effective in reducing other heart attacks and stro@@ kes in people who have already had a heart attack .
through a preliminary recommendation of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it .
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years . the draft proposal does not recommend any treatment that goes beyond this period .
political Cor@@ rec@@ tness culture leaves electoral fraud blo@@ oming in Muslim areas
the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man was removed last year on the release of a government report for corruption
a culture of political cor@@ rec@@ tness has led to the fact that widespread electoral fraud is ignor@@ antly ignored in Muslim communities like a devastating government report today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; former cabinet member Sir Eric Pi@@ les verb@@ ally attacks the police , election ob@@ servers and town halls to have ignored evidence of electoral abuse due to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over@@ sensitivity to eth@@ no and religion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former Minister of Integration and Local Government , who is now a antagon@@ ist king , said that intim@@ id@@ ation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police were allowed to set up shut @-@ off tapes out of elec@@ tive cabins to protect intim@@ id@@ ated voters .
he recommends that voters should prove their identity in order to prove their identity in elections .
at present , a vot@@ er only has to call his name and address .
the report proposes to write non @-@ removable ink on a person &apos;s finger if they release their vote to prevent someone sel@@ ects twice .
whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should get more protection , says Sir Eric .
he demands that the press should have more access to municipal documents and decisions of un@@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not only for election fraud , but should also protect the local government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture that comes with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was ordered from Dow@@ ning Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets Wahl@@ sc@@ and@@ als in the East of London .
last year , a special court ruled that the inc@@ umbent mayor Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was to be reli@@ eved after a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his office .
the Court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in a cy@@ ni@@ cal way &quot; and that he had sil@@ enced his critics with rac@@ ism and Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man is said to have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; led his campaign on the basis of the rel@@ ati@@ ous duty of Muslims to choose him &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 votes were either doub@@ t@@ ful or the result of an im@@ itation in which a person is chosen as someone else .
Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud throughout the country .
he was particularly wor@@ rying about the frau@@ dul@@ ent postal code - with the older members of the Muslim community put pressure on people to elect a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including the guiding of ID cards to prove the identity
in its report it reads : &quot; as evidence has been attached to pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities , especially women and young people to choose according to the will of the elders , especially communities with Pak@@ ist@@ ani or Banglad@@ es@@ hi background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that ... state institutions have unknow@@ ingly ignored such behaviour on account of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over@@ sensitivity regarding eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the ban on political activists to process letter selection documents to stop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poll@@ uting &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report being considered by Ther@@ esa May also requires tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the electoral directory being used for immigration and social welfare purposes .
consider options to ask voters before choosing your passport .
do not use removable ink on a person &apos;s finger as soon as she has submitted her voice to prevent someone sel@@ ects twice .
systematic reviews of the nationality of a person to ensure that they are eligible .
a three @-@ year limitation to applications for automatic letter selection .
ban on political activists to process complete wal@@ let and envel@@ opes of wal@@ let elections .
the police have the authority to set up lock@@ outs around election stations .
a law amend@@ ment facilit@@ ated by a charge of intim@@ id@@ ation in accordance with the Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 ( National Repres@@ entation Act 1983 ) .
prohibition of photography in election stations .
request that only English can be used in the election stations ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training in order to ensure that the employees generally en@@ force that voters go alone in the election cabin .
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that there was no criminal complaint after the Tower Ham@@ lets .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the electoral district has declared Lut@@ om@@ Rah@@ man and his deputy for illegal and illegal practices due to a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to a number of reasons , he was found guilty on the basis of the high requirements in criminal proceedings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effec@@ tual &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check@@ points &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the city halls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; election @-@ registration departments &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court ruling in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our country , as the mother of parliam@@ ents , bears a proud heritage , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spread of electoral fraud and den@@ ial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation .
crazy to K@@ ate Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gän@@ ger and other famous doppel@@ gan@@ ger from Olympic athletes in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio have gone over the French cycling sports@@ woman Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ PRE@@ VO@@ T out of the edge and band that has proven to be an impressive du@@ ke of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympi@@ oni@@ kin is by far not the only ath@@ lete competing in gold , who has his own famous doppel@@ gan@@ ger - at least not if one is allowed to believe in the social media faith .
in honour of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that currently fli@@ cker on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olymp@@ ians that show more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties .
the Hunter and the Wolf : team member of the U.S. team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son , left , is compared with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio since his childhood
besides K@@ ate Doppel@@ gän@@ gerin on the cycle track many people on the internet indicated how a certain ar@@ cher might be the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio .
the team member of the U.S. team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son has caused a storm on Twitter after pictures on which he looks very similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star .
in fact , the ar@@ cher received the ma@@ dness in the social media and admitted he had already heard since his childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I myself do not see great simil@@ arity , with the exception of facial hair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bra@@ dy the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a good @-@ looking guy , so I like it as a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the striking simil@@ arity between the British Wei@@ t@@ jum@@ per Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
Russian gymn@@ ast , Ali@@ ya Must@@ afa , with her expressive eyes , is supposed to be a doppel@@ gan@@ ger for the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years .
one way higher : this user believes Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption act@@ ress .
another sub@@ du@@ ed comparison was drawn between the tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who has similarly severe ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medal t@@ egu@@ ard Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ fi@@ mo@@ va exhibits more than just the sun @-@ tann@@ ed skin and bl@@ ond hair as the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Nathan Adrian was att@@ ested by fans to resem@@ ble an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , on the right , have a similar face shape and eyes
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others liked the simil@@ arities also .
theory put into space : according to this user , there might be a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter user explained their satisfaction that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the internet thinks Hope Solo and J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the US football star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar face shape and eyes .
other popular compar@@ isons included K@@ err@@ i Wal@@ sh J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold medal winner in Tur@@ nen Gab@@ by Douglas , who has her own beautiful , wide smile similar to that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ BC comment@@ ator for the Olympic Games ap@@ olog@@ ises for his statement that Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers have died &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a pig &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds analysis of the fourth place of the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Ai Yan@@ han at d@@ r 4x@@ 200m Frei@@ stil@@ s@@ aff@@ el ou@@ tra@@ ged viewers of the C@@ BC live broadcast of the Ol@@ m@@ yp@@ ical games on Wednesday
Canadian broad@@ ca@@ ster C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year old Chinese swi@@ mmer passed &quot; like low , &quot; and during the race like &quot; a pig died . &quot;
the comment@@ ator B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was switched off when at the end of the 4x@@ 100m free @-@ style swimming pool his own opinions were removed .
Mac@@ Donald , who was brought aboard the C@@ BS commentary team to give more &quot; colour , &quot; one could hear : &quot; this small 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in lost the connection , baby . &quot;
too excited , went down like low , died like a pig .
thanks for it .
the Chinese float in Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the swimming pool 1 : 5@@ 7,@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , making it possible for the Can@@ adi@@ ans to close the gap to China .
spectators across Canada re@@ acted quickly after they were shocked by the sound and the language .
Em@@ met@@ t Mac@@ far@@ ol twe@@ ets , &quot; H@@ as the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old float from China &quot; has died &quot; like a pig . &quot; ? ? ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idi@@ ot has not broken that they were still on show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ai Yan@@ han from China was described in the final 4 x 200m ² swimming pool for women as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this small 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in lost the connection , baby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the criticism against B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ don@@ ald on Twitter came quickly and hard , in which many gave him speech
Twitter users did not return when they heard how un@@ sensitive B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Donald was
another Twitter user Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald .
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and lets us all look like ra@@ cists .
a short time later , Scott Russ@@ el , who hosted the C@@ BC broadcast , ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the comment by Mac@@ Donald and said , &quot; We ap@@ ologi@@ ze that the comment about a swimming performance was broadcast . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was an un@@ fortunate phrase , we are sorry that it happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed for more than 90 times among the people who answered the B@@ emer@@ is via Twitter
the comment@@ ator Scott Russ@@ el had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the name of Mac@@ Donald
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ology to more than 90 other Twitter users compl@@ aining about Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and delivered a message .
we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible for them to be broad@@ cast@@ ed .
yesterday night we quickly ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our viewers on show and our followers in the social media .
to make one clear , B@@ yr@@ on &apos;s comments related to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not on them as a person .
nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ happy formulation . B@@ yr@@ on does what he said , very sorry .
on Thursday afternoon , Mac@@ Donald ap@@ ologi@@ zed in the show and tried to justify his re@@ mark by saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment that I made after the Women &apos;s Pool in the C@@ BC Olympics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I focused on the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not to them as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , no cont@@ emp@@ t was intended and I &apos;m very sorry . &quot;
purchaser in Pri@@ mark ou@@ tra@@ ged by a woman trying to sham@@ elessly wash under@@ wear in the middle of the business
the buyers did not know where to go when a woman pulled out her clothing in the middle of a row to try under@@ pants .
to wor@@ sen the situation , she insp@@ ected how she looked at it , pulled it off and put it back into the shelf .
she continued to rum@@ mage and ta@@ sted four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .
the primary business at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , where the woman pro@@ cured the under@@ pants before she put her back into the shelf
a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was in the shop at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had tried the under@@ wear , &quot; she went back and left the shop without buying anything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; People could not believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
standing in the middle of the sales area , she took a pair of under@@ pants from the delivery , pulled out her own ti@@ ghts and pants and ta@@ sted her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t even try to find a somewhat dis@@ crete place to do it - she simply stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone star@@ ed when she pulled out the pants that you obviously didn &apos;t like , as she put her back on the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same thing with three other under@@ pants before she finally decided that she didn &apos;t like anything .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b anyone watching - or thinking about the person who could possibly buy the pants they had ta@@ sted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how hard to think that someone would take shelter with someone who had a different person and who were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I have received , the staff tried to pull clothes from the sale after it went - which is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and find out that another woman had her and went out again and didn &apos;t wash her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man for Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that occurred on Tuesday 9th August in our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a from weapons attacks
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com might make it a bit safer for you .
we talked with Rh@@ one Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand@@ master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at close distance .
regardless of whether you approach you from the front or from behind , this video will show you how to turn the sk@@ ewer against your rob@@ ber .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you approach you from behind , you should turn first , so that you can see your attack@@ er and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; go out of the shot line , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then seize the weapon between your for@@ ear@@ m and shoulder before hitting it with your free el@@ bow .
beat him with his knee to the bar and twist while the attack@@ er cro@@ oked before pain , the weapon out of his hands . beat him with the run into the face and move backwards while holding the weapon on him .
with attack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line , grab the gun and twist it so that the attack@@ er cannot shoot .
shift the weight to the weapon at the same time and hit the attack@@ er on the chest , then twist the weapon out of its grip before moving backwards and strai@@ gh@@ tening the weapon on it .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it moves to Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that rob@@ ber@@ y is the saf@@ est way to transfer your money - unless you are a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master .
trav@@ eller Ian W@@ right che@@ ers his tongue to the dir@@ ti@@ est places of Europe for a travel guide
a British trav@@ eller desc@@ ended his immune system and whol@@ eh@@ ear@@ t@@ edly a serious test by le@@ aking up some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
the pres@@ enter and author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k switched his train to a euro note , a hand@@ rail at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a r@@ ins@@ ing button of a train toilet as well as a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance of his immune system .
before checking out each object he used a lumin@@ ometer to show himself and us what he is going to do .
but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results .
the thought of replacing the r@@ ins@@ ing button of a draw toilet , which has been used by thousands of others , may be completely re@@ pul@@ sive , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen flush .
on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the support of intestinal bacteria as well as about his own health .
luckily nothing left what he le@@ aked off , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth .
Mr. W@@ right became known to test the resistance of his bow@@ el by travelling through the world and eating strange as well as wonderful things .
from public funds to train stations to washing kno@@ bs of toilets , the task assigned its immune system defini@@ tively under a test
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the film he justified his call in any case .
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his trial period showed a lumin@@ ance of more than 4000 units .
in comparison , the lumin@@ ance count of freshly washed hands is less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet , which he refused to refuse , after their lumin@@ ance number was over 4000 units , while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60
Mr. W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that comes close to the worst thing I &apos;ve sm@@ elled in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing more imp@@ ure than that !
I will not lick here because it is disgu@@ sting inside .
the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company is equi@@ pping Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system .
vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and new categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ oren@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we really wanted to offer something new to the consumers .
something that is fascinating to look at while at the same time explaining the advantages of pro@@ bio@@ tics .
we carried out crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming sessions that ended that we said &quot; Let &apos;s call Ian . &quot;
they claim that the interest in intestinal health will become a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them into a wider context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system .
growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of hum@@ our !
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the film , added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had ta@@ sted some of the things I told him to lick , like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet , which is shown in the film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to check them out and others , where this was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad we &apos;ve recorded some of these dirty goo@@ dies on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o from 2015 , 84 percent of respon@@ dents associate lac@@ tic acid bacteria in particular with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines , and 58 percent said that they at least occasionally use products containing lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
as@@ o@@ zi@@ ale family destro@@ ys social apartment in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
an as@@ o@@ cial family left her social apartment after a deletion with a loss of £ 50,000 because she had terr@@ orized her neighbors .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ vis@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after they were forci@@ bly removed from their property , shocked employees of the housing association found the property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition .
the walls had g@@ aping holes , wooden plan@@ ks were torn , garbage was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was s@@ me@@ ared to the walls .
the family were res@@ ett@@ led and it is assumed that they are now living in a private accommodation
Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ vo@@ y , who works for home administration at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said she was afraid that the apartment was no longer repaired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for people here and I think that people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider , since this property is thought to be considered as not so beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and their reputation is also .
the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment meanwhile and the police said that the terror that the family had added , street fights with bas@@ eball bats , intim@@ id@@ ation of residents , drug abuse , drug traffi@@ cking and excessive scre@@ aming , quar@@ rels and cur@@ ses included .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name stood on the lease , got an arrangement for anti@@ social behavior in June .
in some rooms of the house , which may be torn down under certain circumstances , old tr@@ ash was found
in the estate in which drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wooden plan@@ ks were torn down
neighbors told us they had to fight them on the street and regularly called the police
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ ved them and their partner viol@@ ently from the property this week after giving them an extended deadline of 11 weeks to voluntarily withdraw .
the del@@ o@@ oning was che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbours who said their lives were made hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They didn &apos;t care for anybody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years beside them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; we could not sleep this morning . &quot;
we got up because it was so quiet here - we &apos;re not used to that !
now that they are finally gone , it will be beautiful .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Managers of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said it would have given the family to cooperate with local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years .
rub@@ b@@ ish and old toys were thrown down on the over@@ grown side of the Municipal House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ant det@@ ain@@ ees to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and family because del@@ o@@ oning is always the final step that considers Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was a very difficult case as the behaviour was extreme and their deeds had to be aw@@ ful for their neighbors .
I appreciate all the work that my team , the De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police and members of the community who have cour@@ age@@ ously approached us and have provided us with the information .
I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and the message conve@@ ys that anti @-@ social behaviour is not tolerated .
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 .

in 2014 , the police conducted a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g cannabis as well as balances , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ als and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ on received a fine after ow@@ ning the possession of a class B drug in commercial intent .
she claimed that the money was for a tom@@ bst@@ one of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who died in 2013 in a car accident .
having stayed without shelter , T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh .
many room walls of the house were decorated with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police say that they will deleg@@ ate ten@@ ants who do not stick to the house rules
Angela C@@ row from the De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police said that del@@ o@@ oning was a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants who do not stick to the house rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think that they can behave without self @-@ reproach and those who have been har@@ med by such behaviour , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behavior that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
tourists in Portugal in panic after a ti@@ ph@@ er military jet over@@ flies the beach
sun wor@@ ship@@ pers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
a Portuguese P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft of air forces put an unbelievable whi@@ rl@@ wind flight
the Air Force admitted that it was on a training flight , but insist@@ ed that there was no security risk .
this was the moment when frigh@@ tened tourists start to panic after a ti@@ pping jet broke over a full beach .
dramatic video footage showed how the military plane flew close to the beach in Av@@ eiro in northern Portugal .
the vac@@ ation@@ ers sprang up when they understand@@ ably began to worry about the noise of the nozzle engines , without first seeing what came through the clouds .
the incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many holi@@ day@@ makers who posted videos on the dramatic Fly @-@ By in the social media , said : &quot; it flew very low twice and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was just surfing and it felt as if the plane fell on me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists on the beach of Av@@ eiro were stag@@ ger@@ ed when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly low
the Portuguese Air Force today announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and fly so deeply that this was the only way to recognize them .
the speaker said that due to the poor visibility of the area , the jet flew slightly deeper than usual , but the air forces persist@@ ed that safety at no time was at risk .
surface fires have destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland these sum@@ mers , where also four people on Madeira Island came to death .
the Portuguese air forces today stated that the pilot had to fly so deeply due to the conditions - strong fog and smoke .
the plane was on a training flight where the pilot boats had to identify as part of the exercise
Super@@ cup : Bar@@ ca with concerns about Sevilla
Sevilla : on Sunday FC Barcelona will fight for the first title win in the new football season .
the Catal@@ ans compete in the Du@@ el around the Spanish Super@@ cup out against the FC Sevilla , the back@@ lash rises three days later at Camp No@@ u .
the Dou@@ ble@@ bee must for@@ go to N@@ ey@@ mar , who is competing in Brazil for the Olympic football tournament with the superior cup@@ fin@@ alist and reig@@ ning Europa League Champion among others .
also , Go@@ alie Marc @-@ Andr@@ e ter St@@ egen is missing .
the Germans suffered a change in the knee in the training , with which the demand for Bar@@ ca was clari@@ fied at least for the time being in favor of Claudio Bra@@ vo .
the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er St@@ egen have been competing in Barcelona for two years now as number one .
coach Luis En@@ rique has so far reno@@ unc@@ ed a clear decision and made Bra@@ vo in the League , but T@@ er St@@ egen in most of the other races cont@@ ests .
before the first mandatory game of the new season , there are doubts about the fitness status of the team , which was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool with 0 : 4 .
even at 3 : 2 in the trial against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday , Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. were not really convinced .
Sevilla , in turn , continued to di@@ gest the 2 : 3 defeat in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid and stri@@ ves for the second triumph at the &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana . &quot;
with so far eleven successes , Barcelona is the record winner in this competition .
Ma Long in its own league of table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic champion .
on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro , the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his coun@@ try@@ man and &quot; tit@@ leh@@ older &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12,@@ 5,@@ 4,@@ 4 ) .
thus the World Ran@@ king first won the &quot; Golden Grand S@@ lam &quot; with successes at the World Cup , World Cup , World Tour Fin@@ al@@ tur@@ nier and the Olympia .
bronze went to the Japanese Ju@@ n Mi@@ zut@@ ani .
the two Chinese made it into the final game as expected and made the title among themselves .
it was clear that for the third time in a row Chinese would fetch the single title in the sign of the Five R@@ ings .
last non @-@ Chinese on the top olymp@@ ic bar@@ gain was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Legi@@ on@@ ary Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
Ma and Z@@ hang were left to the record alone , they had no coaches between the sentences and in time @-@ outs .
they had withdrawn on the tri@@ b@@ une and left their cont@@ actors on one another in a fair competition alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve played the matches to this place for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the final I play for myself , &quot; Z@@ hang said logical .
after the game , gold and silver med@@ alli@@ sts posed with the China flag .
the match itself was un@@ expect@@ edly one @-@ sided .
Ma had to fight with his 28 year old opponent only in the first set really .
after that he set the tempo on the plate and left Z@@ hang only a total of 13 points .
due to the superi@@ ority of Ma , the expected ro@@ using match was not developed .
but nevertheless enough stunning ball changes were to be seen .
Mi@@ hal@@ ani won the game for bronze versus the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
in his quar@@ ter@@ final against the German champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ an had suffered a ri@@ b injury , then in medical treatment , &quot; ultimately &quot; had to be content with sheet metal .
inci@@ dentally , the Swe@@ des Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Pers@@ son ( 42 / 2008 ) had become Olympic @-@ fourth in similarly high table tennis .
Donald Tr@@ ump Gran@@ ts ″ Power@@ ful Problems ″ in the election campaign
the leadership of the US Republi@@ cans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in traditional conservative states to lose their majority .
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump now announced weaknesses of his election campaign in the former republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ old U@@ tah .
a rare moment in which the usually large @-@ gauge and self @-@ confident mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ ary expressed something like concern , as correspon@@ dents reported .
after having thrown 16 ri@@ vals within the own Republi@@ can camp , doubts about his success in the battle for the White House are now growing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have tremendous problems in U@@ tah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump before Evangel@@ ical Christians , which he asked for support in important states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to false reports about his can@@ did@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media campaign .
republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ olds wi@@ ggle
U@@ tah is usually a safe bank for the Republi@@ cans .
a survey conducted by Surv@@ ey@@ or from June according to a survey of the Dem@@ ok@@ rates , H@@ illary Clinton .
other institutes see Tr@@ ump in the front , but not with the distance that is common for Republi@@ can candidates in the federal state .
Arizona and Georgia are regarded as endangered .
in an interview by the station CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump responded to the question of how he wanted to stop Clinton &apos;s advance : &quot; just as I have done so far . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and afterwards : this will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either successful &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he does nothing else than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; telling the truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it was not sufficient for him for reasons of political correctness , this was fine , said Tr@@ ump .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to the press reports , the party Tr@@ ump should have threatened to raise funds to support his electoral campaign , he should not be able to present any better survey results .
instead , the candidates of the Republi@@ cans would be stronger for Congress .
Olympia : three @-@ sixth fraud on dop@@ ing test
the IO@@ C intends to set up a disciplinary commission .
Kenya &apos;s athletes are facing accidents after the second dop@@ ing affair at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympics .
after a fraud test in the Olympic village , Kenya sent a coach home .
the International Olympic Committee decided to promptly set up a disciplinary commission to investigate the case .
a Ken@@ yan function@@ ary told us that the former Spr@@ inter and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , in the Olympic village gave a urine sample under the name of the 800 @-@ metre @-@ runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Ro@@ ti@@ ch .
this was reported to the team leadership of Kenya by the dop@@ ing controllers .
the IA@@ AF world association asked the IO@@ C about the case to ex@@ ert its own investigations , shared an IA@@ AF speaker .
&quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures of the IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; said it in an IA@@ AF explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) has gone to the dop@@ ing control station and has signed up and signed up as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Ro@@ ti@@ ch , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained K@@ eni@@ as chief de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was in possession of the accreditation of the athletes , who stood on the list for training controls of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Ro@@ ti@@ ch had become World Cup fourth in 2015 over 800 meters .
four days earlier , the Ken@@ yan athle@@ tics delegation , Michael Ro@@ ti@@ ch , had been withdrawn from Rio games .
he is said to have informed athletes of his country about pending dop@@ ing tests .
according to media reports , he was said to have been arrested at Nairobi &apos;s airport .
Kenya has been under special monitoring for a long time at the IO@@ C after numerous dop@@ ing agreements .
in the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls submitted by the IO@@ C in front of the Rio Olympics , it was previously noted that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted .
before the summer games in Brazil , the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before the start of the Olympic Games .
as a consequence , the WA@@ DA Kenya took from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control con@@ forms with the rules of WA@@ DA .
Kenya is regarded as a big runner @-@ nation .
athletes of the country won most med@@ als at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
in a series of television reports of the ARD , accus@@ ations have always been raised that dop@@ ing funds are easily accessible in Kenya and there should be a considerable ment@@ ality of sport fraud .
last but not least , IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und called for a similar investigation into Kenya , as he had recru@@ ited them in Russian athle@@ tics .
thereby it was possible to demonstrate that in this type of sport was comprehen@@ sively and systematically sub@@ du@@ ed .
Russian athletes were then excluded from the summer games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Salzburger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Shakespeare @-@ year the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et .
with it a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bernstein &apos;s masterpiece .
the artistic director , Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli , wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and fulfilled a youth room with the role of Mary .
the Orchest@@ er@@ graben gives the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the leadership of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gust@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he enth@@ uses .
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their pace and melody .
it is a wonderful mixture , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have amber music in our blood !
Bart@@ oli plays an older Maria in this st@@ aging .
she re@@ members her love with Tony while the younger Maria plays and dances .
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
firstly because it is musi@@ cally exceptional !
and then there would be Maria &apos;s personality .
she says in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
so it is wise , of course nai@@ ve , and very passionate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very similar to me , my Italian character I have as a Roman , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honor to work with her .
it is an immense human being .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an exceptional artist and very passionate ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
one sees it in each of his movements , in his gaze , it is his life !
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and a happy approach to life , that is very important at all !
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up @-@ to @-@ date : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this piece it &apos;s about prejudi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today we have the refugees , then the buff@@ alo@@ cans walked to New York , and the New York residents didn &apos;t want them .
they are the same topics , and they are as powerful as at that time .
59 years later , the piece is still relevant .
London school@@ girl who joined the IS was killed in Syria
K@@ adi@@ za Sult@@ ana , one of three British school@@ girls who left London last year to join the IS , reports said in Syria .
the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me A@@ kun@@ je@@ e said that her family found out about her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria some weeks ago .
it was suspected that it was killed by a Russian air attack in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the group &apos;s bul@@ war@@ k in the country , I@@ TV news reported on Thursday .
sul@@ ana was 17 years old and died according to her family shortly after she had pre@@ tended to leave the war @-@ torn country and return to England .
&quot; one can only hope that the only good is in it - as warning and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - keeping people from making this decision ever , &quot; said A@@ kun@@ je@@ e .
in February 2015 , Sult@@ ana and two other school girls from the east of London got into a plane in the direction of Turkey , followed by a bus to the Syrian border .
Sul@@ tan@@ as &apos;s family was told that she married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria - and became a widow within a few months .
Rei@@ d says Clinton won in case of election victory in Gar@@ land as candidates for the Supreme Court
Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the democr@@ ats in the Senate , is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , will nom@@ inate the judge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court .
Republi@@ cans in the Senate have blocked Russia &apos;s confirmation since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Conn@@ ell believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the dec@@ eased Ju@@ dge at the Supreme Court Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference calling Clinton to choose &quot; Gar@@ land &quot; with a certain degree of certainty .
a spokes@@ woman of Rei@@ d later said that he would not have spoken to Clinton whether she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he was spec@@ ulating .
he praised Gar@@ land and said that Clinton &apos;s team would not worry about un@@ rest with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the supreme judge of the US Court of Appe@@ als for the District of Columbia .
RAID said Republi@@ can blocked the Gar@@ lands nom@@ ination , be lack@@ eys and hel@@ pers of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump .
he also noted that Donald Tr@@ ump is un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
state wants nude calendar for &quot; women and for men &quot;
the Tre@@ ats Magazine works together with the photographer David Bell@@ em@@ ere to bring out Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired Calendar for 2017 .
but instead of famous naked people they want to find the next generation of super@@ models for their N@@ U M@@ uses Calendar for 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us at the beginning of this year that his nude magazine of Old@@ school @-@ Play@@ boy is distingu@@ ish@@ able as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Play@@ boy for men &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I do this for women .

Turkey : Kurdish community counts with mass flight
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anyone who does not suit and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Pres@@ idency of the Gü@@ len @-@ Stiftung Dialog and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the short term , the Kur@@ ds municipality of Germany reck@@ ons with tens of thousands of refugees who fled from Turkey to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the medium term , even &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few hundred thousand &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the chairman Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to the harsh pen@@ chant of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan following the attempted put@@ sch , the Kurdish community of Germany is expecting a mass flight to Germany .
&quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term , with hundreds of thousands of refugees from Turkey in Germany , when the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says Chairman Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; World &quot; of Friday .
because the government had already crossed Kurdish stron@@ gh@@ olds with sanctions a few months ago , 500@@ ,000 Kur@@ ds were fle@@ eing Turkey .
after the twi@@ sted put@@ sch , secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks would be added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many will want to re @-@ start in Europe once they are supp@@ ressed in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state that takes refugees takes refugees in their own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chief of band@@ age accused the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in al@@ evi@@ tic cities .
with this , Erdo@@ gan is aiming to raise the expression on the remaining Kur@@ ds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last major minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have been exter@@ min@@ ated or driven out over the past hundred years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chairman called for the Federal Government to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positioned &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and his followers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany too , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; witch hunt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Erdo@@ gan critic is taking place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad .
more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists .
the br@@ anding as a man@@ ure trailer destro@@ ys teachers and other ac@@ adem@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; anyone who does not suit and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , by the way also the cab@@ alists and sec@@ ul@@ ari@@ sts , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , president of the Gü@@ len @-@ Stiftung Dialog and Education , the &quot; World . &quot;
as reported by the newspaper by calling on figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior , the Turks have already presented the largest group of asylum seek@@ ers in Germany because of political persecution .
at the reporting date June 30 , this was 11,@@ 3@@ 86 people and therefore nearly 29 percent of all recognised as asylum @-@ seek@@ ers ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
in this survey , not those before war , poverty or lack of perspective are found .
asylum seek@@ ers according to the Basic Law are exclusively politically , i.e. from the state side , individually persecuted .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : go where it hur@@ ts &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals don &apos;t get anything from the summer campaign - and the holiday makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to choose the land tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
in 2021 , the Parliament election will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ in parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year .
for more stup@@ id@@ ly than hitherto it is not possible : summer holidays , heat and day @-@ to @-@ day elections - that bit@@ es .
the locals , who are to be convinced by the election milit@@ ants , are on vacation .
the most tourists who are in the country , on the island of Use@@ dom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not residents , so do not choose the land tag .
there are practical problems for this : hel@@ pers who hang up posters , infl@@ ate ballo@@ ons , spread fl@@ yers and en@@ umer@@ ate voices in the end can only be lab@@ orious .
until 4 September 2016 , the election and final day of the holiday , Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania must once again let the people pass their election campaign .
the hot phase , if you can tell it at all , has just begun .
and it &apos;s also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must fear his office .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U .
it is exciting how much new@@ bie Af@@ D cuts off and what remains in the end co@@ ali@@ tion@@ μ .
S@@ ella , 66 years old and head of government since 2008 , makes an almost in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous electoral campaign , one sees from his big posters .
he travels through the land , distri@@ butes ro@@ ses and chat@@ ting a bit with the people , just as his legendary wor@@ m@@ son predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff also did .
otherwise , Seel@@ ing has received cold feet and Chancellor Angela Merkel is responsible for the blo@@ oming of the Af@@ D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her refugee policy , her &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We are creating &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has ha@@ st@@ ened the rise of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the beautiful office . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U with its peak channel data , the Interior Minister Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when you make the right place at the right place at the wrong time .
she has invited chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel to large @-@ scale demonstrations twice ; Merkel parliament is in the north @-@ east .
but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority from other federal states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , general secretary of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania , recently in the N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it &apos;s too bad for anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once .
otherwise , the Nor@@ theast @-@ CD@@ U largely wai@@ ves the usual election campaigns on market@@ places and in front of shopping m@@ alls with umbrellas and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means co@@ king , playing only a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; subordin@@ ate role &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Union has also noticed that in the country you have to make a lot of effort to find a wire to the people again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : hardly available in the sides of the country .
the Council of the CD@@ U Elec@@ tor Co@@ co@@ on to his comrades is also self @-@ expos@@ ing : &quot; you must go where it hur@@ ts , namely where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden weddings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
because a lot is on the game , Sell@@ ering has now called his SPD into a particularly committed campaign .
in poll@@ s , the Socialists and Democrats recently stood behind partners CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just shortly before the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
in 2011 the SPD won a clear victory at 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
the Gre@@ ens , a small party with seven percent in poll@@ s , should make the leap into parliament .
they make a modern virtue out of the need of holidays and spend their campaign largely on the Internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it calls the president of the country Claudia Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green elec@@ tors &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; embar@@ k on search for traces of local voters amongst the holi@@ day@@ makers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , cur@@ v@@ t straight with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg Lak@@ es@@ ide and finds it even beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their impression : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; election holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 remo@@ del@@ ing : restaurants suffer from block@@ age
at the speed with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ itated , there is nothing to complain about .
for those responsible for the construction work , which start at 5.@@ 30 a.m. and end only at 8@@ pm , there are all praise .
&quot; they did everything pretty sh@@ ak@@ y , &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the jet fuel station .
this is a super team .
there is no default .
the construction site could be moved to the south at the beginning of the week , until the end of October .
the addition of the responsible persons responsible for the construction works is also commen@@ ded , for instance when it comes to the furnishing of homes .
since the construction site was s@@ ander@@ ed on Monday to the south and also the blocking of the Asp@@ erg@@ strasse in O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen was lifted and thus also the connection to Rot@@ tenburg exists , the traffic situation within the place has been relaxed .
the citizens can now drive from the B 27 from O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen on both sides .
the cre@@ denti@@ al traffic through the place seems to go back .
&quot; there have been some considerable discomfort , &quot; says the deputy head manager Florian King , responsible for the rest@@ au@@ ration of the rehabilitation management .
the residents of Bach@@ el@@ strasse , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many cre@@ eping routes were looking for and rather familiar to their navigation system than the sign@@ age .
what led to the fact that some trucks occupy themselves in residential areas .
as the speed limits were not comp@@ lied with , the municipality exac@@ erb@@ ated the measuring vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; there were considerable transgres@@ sions , &quot; says King , who made himself aware of the situation himself .
two to three per minute have already been flas@@ hed .
the quick@@ est was on the way at 77 hours per hour in the Tempo @-@ 30 zone .
since the construction site has moved on , it has become qui@@ eter .
for the business people at the B 27 it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ tenburg the street is open again .
business@@ men don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
but the fact that the B 27 re@@ development has led to break@@ through@@ s with them leaves everyone one asks to look through .
however , some are more and some less affected .
those who have less to do with the end customer , i.e. for other companies , have hardly any consequences for them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Sul@@ z also speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at most light drop &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but also ad@@ mits that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the running news is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most heavily exploited are the locals along the road .
Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , Ow@@ ner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crow@@ ned , finds clear words .
this is already exist@@ ential threat .
not only him , but all the restaurants have &quot; hit hard . &quot;
the customers were missing from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil .
we have to be happy about every euro sales .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the sales revenue accounts for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far above 50 percent &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the road marking took its operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back two years back &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he had to release half of his employees .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed , politics would have re@@ acted differently .
instead , government president Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request from G@@ öh@@ ner , whether there could be a financial compensation , the restaurant benefits from the advantages of the location on the B 27 . now it must also bear the disadvantages that arise through the renovation .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties , where so much more gener@@ ously handled .
in all cases , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist .
after all , the family business has been here since 17@@ 15 , pointing to the long history .
that other regular guests are less frequently passing by due to the complicated traffic guidance , he can understand .
if you can &apos;t drive , it is also somewhere else beautiful .
G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt that his stem cell returns to the end of the renovation work .
despite the crises with BSE and avian influ@@ enza , G@@ öh@@ ner considers the effects of the B 27 construction work on its customers for the biggest crisis that its restaurant experienced in its long @-@ standing history .
six months of construction work , this is brutal .
in the name of the fight against terrorism , laws are constantly being viol@@ ated .
after the recent attacks , Interior Minister de Ma@@ izi@@ ère now presents a big security package .
but what does a d@@ ull status have to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gives the verse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically reasonable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the coalition partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Minister of the Interior in the presentation of his new security package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they don &apos;t demand anyone .
other , further points would initially be discussed within the parties .
also in this I am offen@@ ded .
but as Minister of the Interior , however , his results were found and at a &quot; re@@ cover@@ able consensus &quot; within the Coalition .
after the recent attacks in Wu@@ erz@@ burg and Ans@@ bach , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère had a little time to pass before he presented his conclusions for security in the republic .
but they are all the more extensive .
a lot is already known , announced , announced , that a new security agency will take care of un@@ encrypted communication is not new .
it is also not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU directives on air passenger data and weapons law .
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security agencies is also not surprising .
in part de Ma@@ izi@@ ère launches a second attempt for proposals that have not yet been made with the SPD : he wants to recru@@ it sympathy for terrorist groups under penalty and kno@@ ck jihadi@@ sts with double citizenship to the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ad@@ mits the CD@@ U . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he still believes this to be reasonable and I don &apos;t demand anything that doesn &apos;t have a chance with the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ ist anyway .
a few new ideas are presented to de Ma@@ izi@@ ère as well .
some of them have in common : he plans quick methods for deport@@ ations and more opportunities to det@@ ain people from deport@@ ation .
refugees target@@ ing the country must first let their smartphones lick and reveal social media accounts for a security audit .
in case of divor@@ ce for rejected asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to make some even worse than up to now - such as comm@@ itting crimes or deliberately throwing their papers away to disgu@@ ise their identity .
some of these are political and legal .
some of them are still in@@ treated and leave questions un@@ answered .
and at some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of patients , for example , the question arises : what does this actually have to do with safety and terror ?
yes , says de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the issues of refugees and terror .
but it cannot be said that the attacks of Ans@@ bach and Wu@@ erz@@ burg were refugees .
in addition , in view of the high number of refugees , many people were worried about security .
and things that were deeply occupied by people could not be cl@@ ung out even during election campaigns .
the focus is on internal security .
first the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
and yes , there are election fights .
for this reason , the Union and the SPD are increasingly taking place in the topic of internal security .
in the past few days , between the two parties it went up .
only a gar@@ ris@@ ky dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons Interior Minister , in which the department chiefs also demand a Bur@@ ka ban and a return from dual citizenship .
also here de Ma@@ izi@@ ère ar@@ ills irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able sounds .
he keeps nothing from turning away from the double pass .
we have satisfied the discussion in Germany .
to re@@ plen@@ ish them is not sensible .
and in the case of a Bur@@ ka ban , he has constitutional obj@@ ections .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether its own package at all corners is constitutional and whether it is actually &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reasonable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the coalition partner , must first show itself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there &apos;s a lot of things to do for stri@@ fe .
but the SPD , too , is currently trying to improve on the subject of internal security .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything , which contributes to further increase security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Volkswagen is still gli@@ ding off .
despite diesel sc@@ and@@ als , deliveries of deliveries increase worldwide .
but it does not work in all markets .
in the recall action there is vor@@ tex around a term .
Volkswagen starts the second half of the year on deliveries .
despite its many brands and some well @-@ running markets , Europe &apos;s largest automobile industry continues to boast a plus in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ running markets .
but in July , the VW brand was weaker mainly in Western Europe and thus heavily poll@@ uted the total sales , as announced by the company in D@@ ax .
in July , the VW brand sold 1.8 percent fewer vehicles than in the previous year with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars .
sales in Western Europe , the second most important market in China alone , were 14 percent lower than the previous year &apos;s month .
shipments fell by almost a sixth in the German home market .
brand sales leader Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weaker figures from July , above all , to two sales days less in Europe .
in addition , there has been a purchase restra@@ int in some core markets through &quot; changing economic conditions . &quot;
in addition to the situation surrounding the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote for ex@@ iting from the EU explained a spokes@@ woman .
in the USA , where the exhaust f@@ umes have escal@@ ated first , a minus is also available .
great support for VW is the Chinese market .
all in all , the primarily affected home brand of Lower Saxony is much more gli@@ ding due to the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months there is only an ex@@ tradition of 0.@@ 9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles .
from January to July , group sales head Fred Kap@@ pler continued to present a sales station .
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles at this time , 5,@@ 9@@ 04 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had been tam@@ pered with with a software exhaust .
in Germany alone , VW inv@@ okes about 2.5 million wag@@ ons for retro@@ fitting into the workshops .
in the course of the retro@@ fitting , VW confirmed that the conversion of cars has no negative effects .
after upgrading the vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the car has a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certificate to the customers after the conversion , but don &apos;t speak of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it was said on Friday in business circles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
legal sub@@ t@@ le@@ ties are the reason .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reported that Volkswagen now guarantees its German customers a guarantee for retro@@ fitted diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this would have confirmed the VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport last Monday .
the Ministry of Transport confirmed that there was a meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has fulfilled the constraints of my inquiry committee and KBA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deviations from this will not be accepted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
VW assumes the guarantee that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power after the re@@ arm@@ ament have no deteri@@ or@@ ations and all type @-@ approved vehicle values remain unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen himself uses the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not as it was named in corporate travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term &quot; War@@ ran@@ ty , &quot; Volkswagen has the possibility that for example , customers come to a workshop for half a year after the conversion - and this could lead back to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in customer interest , it is important to avoid that in any other damage , which has nothing to do with the risk sc@@ andal , it comes to in@@ security with regard to possible warranty rules as it was called . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is why Volkswagen does not use the term &quot; guarantee . &quot;
Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands pen@@ alties from rich savers in future - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; chief Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on sight deposit accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Association of German banks refers to an individual case and does not see a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normal savers are not to be afraid of paying pen@@ ni@@ ties for their austerity pen@@ alties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if banks invest money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay their 0.@@ 4 percent penalty .
as of September , the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund is charged with private and corporate customers for deposits of more than € 100,000 on sight deposit or daily money accounts .
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100,000 will cost 400 euros a year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for some time he has kept 40 million euros , which could be lifted from one day to the other and which he could not exploit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they lie with me on the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent of the money , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Chief Financial Officer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot lay down for every million 4000 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the pol@@ lu@@ ter @-@ pays principle , the costs now continue .
to leave the cash in the banks of the Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank would be too dangerous : &quot; I have already experienced four attacks , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! , &quot; said the bank board .
most customers had an understanding and changed to other forms of investment .
few emig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Co@@ operative Association declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy course causes considerable costs in all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to carry it alone is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economically not possible &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks have therefore increased their account management fees , credit cards or transfers .
the Thur@@ in@@ gian People and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land with their Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 made head@@ lines with penalty interest for deposits of three million euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael K@@ em@@ mer , chief executive of the banking association , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay nationwide fees for deposits , so the competition in Germany among banks and savings banks is much too strong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker said that at Lake T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a client@@ ele which is a little more luxuri@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be a problem for a small bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they keep money for free . &quot; &quot; &quot;
founded in 1911 , G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .
well @-@ known actors , sports@@ men and entrepreneurs live in the region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are currently no other banks known to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bayern &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cooperative association , which calculate a reimbur@@ sement rate for deposits by private customers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Spe@@ aker Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of June , the president of the Bundes@@ verband der deutschen Volks@@ banken , Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ banken ( B@@ VR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the threshold to go into neg@@ atives compared to private customers is very , very high . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
competition is tough , and it threat@@ ens the emig@@ ration of investors to competition .
the customers in Germany will not let this fall in the width .
destination Pl@@ ates : who actually bu@@ ys records ?
lonely men middle aged love plates .
before you rush to comment , this statement deri@@ ves from current data under the pseu@@ don@@ ym of non @-@ aven@@ ue male medi@@ ators with harsh insul@@ ts .
according to You@@ g@@ v , the multiple re@@ emergence of records is not based on a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als that want to welcome the news of physical objects , but on mid@@ life nostal@@ gia .
those who recently bought a record are all for@@ esi@@ ght between 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely group of buyers .
there is also no hor@@ des through hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older dr@@ ink@@ ers retain their feelings rather for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but do the results of You@@ g@@ v agree ?
if this blog was a news report on TV , the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , a modest gray suit and stu@@ ffed wild before I stop , hold my hands and say something like : &quot; so let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so let &apos;s take a look at it .
even though the heart of Soh@@ o is slowly losing its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices are now completing the buildings where once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic record specialty shops .
I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to switch off the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to judge their age and minds through observation .
Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , whom I of Si@@ ster Ray ( number of data : two young women , three middle @-@ aged men ) to Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( number of data : eight middle @-@ aged men , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; I already appreciate , &quot; he says .
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 s@@ labs .
these records , pic@@ tured above ( he sent me the snapshot by e @-@ mail , I didn &apos;t follow him home ) , dress the walls of his living room .
the reason he has such a considerable number of albums and sing@@ les is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records which he could not afford than they appeared and to buy items he sold when he was young and broke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70 that appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I thought was too young to buy them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he agrees that those who buy records are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and would like to spend time alone , and add : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink much .
this is my vice .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works with Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many customers whom he meets can apply to You@@ g@@ v profile .
but he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and get to buy their old records .
from the conversations I have conducted , people tend to get rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999 .
customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records , &quot; he says .
this would explain the boom of followers of the record revi@@ vals of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional importance of records ?
it takes only a few seconds in a business like Ph@@ onica , to realize that record stores offer a so@@ othing community of like @-@ minded people .
according to the WE@@ Z some of the older customers were ass@@ aul@@ ting the cont@@ ac@@ tless payment system .
some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of familiar sound boards , from objects that awaken happy memories .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think sometimes it may be the filling of a void or the possession of material possessions as a kind of con@@ sol@@ ation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s for me as a collector , and I think it &apos;s so with many people .
it is a simple way to mentally concern yourself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an employee whis@@ pers from a stack of labels . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey conducted by IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of people who bought a record last month have not yet heard of it .
the survey also found that 41 % have a record player that they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record have no record player .
at this time of the news report I would probably look very worried while I smo@@ o@@ ed through a pile of Bos@@ sa nov@@ a compil@@ ations .
Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( number of people : three middle @-@ aged men ) , has noticed a revival aspect of the revival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; someone came here only recently and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t own a record player , but I &apos;d like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead LP so that I can put it on the shelf &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a big percentage but it definitely happens .
more productive , less music @-@ class .
we have people who say : &quot; I have no record player . &quot;
these are younger people , not older ones who come in slowly .
F@@ opp , which has dedicated the records almost a whole floor , has a colorful audience when I go in .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teenagers and middle @-@ aged women .
even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above shops - Wild Be@@ asts latest syn@@ th@@ esi@@ ze and sex@@ i@@ packed pop instead of experimental jazz is from the speakers - it is good to see such diversity among customers .
none of them looks stran@@ gely lonely , but na@@ ï@@ ve mental trauma is hard to imagine if you stand next to someone for 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around in the shop for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates for sale .
it makes more window shopping than a big shopping .
she doesn &apos;t deserve much , so collecting records is not a real option , she says .
it costs much .
it &apos;s easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; she drives away with a de@@ ar@@ est si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record enthusiasts : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
as I give the appearance of mu@@ stering his je@@ ans pants , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls who are group@@ ing around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter are thinking about buying a cros@@ ley te@@ amm@@ ate .
on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of plates of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
nobody sees them - maybe because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them .
it is pure &quot; plate art . &quot;
but considering that any attraction for these items means more money for the industry and some customers could send in the depths of Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to complain .
it is no surprise that a population group , which has more time and money than others , is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates .
even if my research shows that the results of You@@ g@@ v agree , they , at least in record stores in Soh@@ o , leave the large number of female collectors , who exist in reality , record stores and online forums .
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
they spend their Thursday morning with safety not with bo@@ b@@ bling through record stores of Ber@@ wick Street and the sheets through disks , while they avoid the star@@ ring look of an unc@@ anny , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false pres@@ enter that stands above the shoulders of no susp@@ ecting middle @-@ aged men .

French court re@@ jects offer on the demoli@@ tion of shops in the jungle refugee camp
a French court rejected a request by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , where thousands of refugees live .
during a court hearing this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 temporary businesses in which people within the camp sell goods , from cigar@@ ettes to beer drinks , sell , bar@@ ber services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants .
the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places were to be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which provide a risk of fire and san@@ ity .
humanitarian groups informed the court that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp .
they also argued that temporary shops and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the exp@@ ul@@ sion of people running the 72 temporary businesses , but admitted that the concerns of the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais were absolutely understandable . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ oll@@ a said that food stores , cafés and restaurants would play a much bigger role than simply feeding people who &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; live in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that the areas offer peaceful meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places that was threatened by the travel was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &quot; Café of the camp , which is operated by the public and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the Kids Café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was said that the closure was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these children of a catastrophe , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two aid organizations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants stated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle has increased to more than 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase of new arri@@ vals throughout the summer .
despite the disappointment of Olympia : Martin remains fighting
despite his dis@@ ap@@ pointing performance in the Olympic period , Rad@@ pro@@ i Tony Martin doesn &apos;t want to get caught .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I keep looking at the World Cup , remain confident and fight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the 31 @-@ year @-@ old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has no explanation for his mis@@ erable twel@@ fth place in the sugar lo@@ af .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hon@@ estly have a hard time to comment on the timing of yesterday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he must analyze in peace what reasons were led to the de@@ bac@@ le .
Martin actually wanted to fight for the title at the World Cup in October in Qatar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will look at everything we have changed in recent times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this also includes my position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the three @-@ time world champion , who was lost on Wednesday at 5@@ 4,5 km more than three minutes to Olympic champion Fab@@ ian Canc@@ ell@@ ara ( Switzerland ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers must adapt to the next generation speed meas@@ ur@@ er : in different federal states , among others in Hessen and Brandenburg , new ligh@@ tening devices are being tested , which should be particularly effective .
the futur@@ istic enforcement tra@@ ilers of Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can , for example , be used at accident sites , where it would be too dangerous for mobile measurement by the police .
for example on motorway construction sites or to rehabil@@ itated bridges with temporary speed limit , there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure compliance with speed limit@@ ers there with a stationary gl@@ itter .
a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly .
the enforcement carrier is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts for five days in case of continuous measurement . the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem .
in addition , all vehicles can be recorded simultaneously across multiple tracks with laser measurement technology .
variable speed limits and drive b@@ ans after time , travel strip and vehicle class can also be monitored .
in the highly experienced condition , the trailer can be fitted with each car with trailer hit@@ ch .
to ensure that it is not simply cl@@ utter@@ ed , it is lowered in the measuring mode , so that the wheels disappear in the arm@@ oured and by the way also sweat @-@ proof outer shell .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the gl@@ itter from v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to information from Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and is now also used .
even foreign authorities are flas@@ hing with the new technology : recently France has ordered 100 copies , after an order of 150 pieces last year .
great Britain retri@@ eves silver in the 7 @-@ se@@ er Ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class gets gold
Britain &apos;s impressive performance at the 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by ended on Thursday evening for an ab@@ rupt halt at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were hit with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the odoro stadium here in Rio .
Fi@@ ji divided a master class in handling , side @-@ stepping , back , line and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color .
the defeat was lost due to the not too bad con@@ sol@@ ation prize of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ final on the same day could fall back on them in the final .
but regardless of this , Fi@@ ji would have beaten a 15 @-@ man team in this form .
it could be a con@@ sol@@ ation for GB - but it is probably not that at least a Br@@ ite will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow : Fi@@ j@@ is head coach Ben Ry@@ an , former boss for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult path .
eight years ago , under Ry@@ an , she lost every game with the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they lost only one .
this hat@@ ch will hurt , but progress is amazing .
Fi@@ ji began wonderful and made the attacks GB@@ s boun@@ ce off .
it felt for Captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co. as if they were running in driving buses . the World Series winners went 5 @-@ 0 upwards when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au was over@@ crowded in the corner .
with just four minutes playing time , Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right @-@ hand corner he turned .
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly touched the ball .
a strong T@@ ackle from Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the mountain from Sierra Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa to score a third goal , but it only stopped Fi@@ ji .
in the seventh minute , J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua went a touch down in the right corner and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new one since the re@@ union and there was still more than a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pressed through another weak tac@@ kl@@ ings of the UK team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
it &apos;s like Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 while GB is still learning .
that &apos;s how it is .
UK led basic changes to the half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ vian gap ... for a whole four minutes , which was good for the circumstances of the first half , until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova was going through after a brilliant Inter@@ play of Fi@@ ji .
Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went for a long time in favor of the South Sea sul@@ li@@ ans , whose fans sang , pi@@ v@@ ot flags and d@@ anced on the grand@@ stand .
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame set the icing on the cake with another try in the last few seconds .
the whi@@ stle shou@@ ted , the Fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ g@@ ged and GB collap@@ sed in the lawn .
earlier on the day Fi@@ ji Japan defeated in the semi @-@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and Britain pushed South Africa in a tight half @-@ fin@@ al@@ match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s conversion of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks forward in the first half , but Dan Nor@@ ton went through the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a score among the posts in the second half .
a brilliant late tac@@ kl@@ ing by Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side Team , secured the prize - and thus the silver medal .
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by battle with the trainer &apos;s cancer
there will be no more em@@ ot@@ eric gold than with these games and that will mean what .
from the first stroke to the last , 220 hard H@@ ieve , which go into history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional importance in their golden moment at Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even though it was only the two who were sitting at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the trainer Robin Williams , was present when they row@@ ed to the second Olympic @-@ old in the second without a tax @-@ wife , the first women in the history of British Sports who placed such a benchmark .
her domin@@ ance was absolute , after all her 3@@ 9.@@ ter un@@ defeated bet , which is also unprecedented .
what we see are two brilliant ath@@ let@@ ins gli@@ ding over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which is not reflected in the style of the trium@@ ph@@ al arch .
behind every gold in rowing there is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who contribute to incre@@ mental progress that make the difference and no one was more practical than the trainer who didn &apos;t know about 30 months ago whether he would survive this day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said he ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer that is oper@@ able and that they did .
if you don &apos;t , it spreads everywhere .
it would have been a rather bad situation .
it changes a bit the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , which kept the break to a minimum , if that is the right term at all .
I needed money , so I had to get better soon .
it was an incentive .
I was hospit@@ alized and ran around the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough .
this is how it starts .
rowing in itself is already a challenge , but that makes it even bigger .
in the immedi@@ acy of victory , their first thoughts of Williams , who had a nerve @-@ wra@@ cking morning thus spent a little more than would otherwise talk and thus tried to process his own fears .
&quot; &quot; &quot; p@@ anning , which was a Captain in the Royal Arti@@ llery Regi@@ ment in a deployment in Afghanistan , said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was an emotional wre@@ ck this week . that &apos;s a bit extreme , but it means so much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only repe@@ ats how much I have worked for , how much I and Hel@@ en and Robin worked .
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
without Robin we wouldn &apos;t be anybody , so a massive thank you to him . he &apos;s the best coach in the world .
I couldn &apos;t have asked for a better person for training or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning haven &apos;t lost a race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not compete .
even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to stop , p@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were very trapped in the moment .
Hel@@ en called &quot; St@@ ay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important not to be carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not prepared to do something good .
we didn &apos;t want fire@@ works today , we just wanted to achieve a good result , go out and win the race as we did .
the couple will take a break for one year before making decisions about their future .
glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , her own with the TV adv@@ entur@@ er Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
in London , it took about six months to realize that I am an Olympic champion .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
it feels so much better , &quot; she said .
exemplary for 31 years of clarity
the managing director of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group , Rup@@ pert Gö@@ ller , reti@@ res .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association is regarded as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bay@@ ern &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a small Frank@@ ish drinking water association as a model for large water producers .
this was the name of the Bavarian Broad@@ casting Corporation &apos;s contribution some time ago .
a little later the water forum of the government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia paid tribute to the purpose association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the work of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemplary &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
behind all this Ru@@ pert Gö@@ ller stands for 28 years as managing director .
he was now retired at the age of 65 .
the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group , headquartered in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality Breit@@ brun@@ n , annually fo@@ sters about 150@@ 000 cubic meters of water and supplies 32 places and ham@@ lets with about 5@@ 500 inhabitants .
the commun@@ es are the municipalities of Kirch@@ berg , Breit@@ brun@@ n , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the city of Ba@@ un@@ ach .
there are water supply contracts for other towns and villages .
the current chairman , Breit@@ brun@@ n mayor Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert Gö@@ ller was appointed as a water @-@ keeper in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the ken@@ nel in 1988 .
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they extend from water management and maintenance work through office and organizational activities , budget planning , calculation of fees and supplements up to emergency assignments on weekends , &quot; said the chairman .
as an outstanding event she called the start @-@ up and inauguration of the new wells ( 1994 ) , land purchases in the area of the new wells ( 1998 ) and compensation for farmers , the renovation of the high containers ( 1999 ) , the re @-@ purchase of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the renewal of water pipes .
there has been no stand@@ still and I have always added new things , because water is life @-@ sav@@ vy and drinking water is the most important food .
in her lau@@ dation , she praised Go@@ ll@@ ers faithful , reliable and correct service for over 31 years .
he has used a lot of heart blood for his water purpose association and he lived the water @-@ purpose @-@ association properly , as if it were his own company .
a few weeks ago , as a real practitioner , he was allowed to present the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group &apos;s success concept for nit@@ rate reduction in front of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia water forum .
he received a great deal of recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert Gö@@ ller , on his part , praised the Aqu@@ arian Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best water @-@ keeper and he was a loyal cap .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as cli@@ ma@@ xes from his point of view he described the well building and the restructuring of the ken@@ nel .
the biggest challenge and the most difficult deployment , however , were the rup@@ ture at the high reservoir in Kirch@@ berg on a 3rd of January .
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night so that the villages could be supplied with water .
you can also maintain the supply of Neu@@ brun@@ n once , because you filled the high container of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses .
the management of the Dr@@ inking Water Association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter , who succe@@ eds Ru@@ pert Gö@@ ller .

type of Relation@@ ship in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - Man shoots on life companion
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on Friday at 10.@@ 45 a.m. and injured it fat@@ ally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man himself called and stated to have shot his partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokesperson . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpet@@ r@@ ator is on the run , and after him I am publicly tra@@ ded .
meanwhile , Sven S. could be on the road with the car .
the man is about 1,80 meters large , muscular , brown @-@ burnt and has a smooth .
meanwhile , the police published a photo of him .
but it is a few years old .
in the meantime the man is wearing a bald head .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still carry the weapon with him , so the police .
those who see Sven S. shall call the 110 .
the police are talking about a &quot; relationship . &quot;
the victim was born in 1988 , the perpet@@ r@@ ator in 1981 .
the responsible police in Lü@@ beck did not initially want to provide information about the Ta@@ ther@@ ing or the relationship between perpet@@ rators and victims , but confirmed that a human being had been killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a crime crime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t say more at this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokesperson in Lü@@ beck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a special action command ( SE@@ K ) was at the scene of the crime .
steel - Licht@@ blick for the German Steel Industry
the crisis @-@ torn and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains unaffected by additional costs in millions .
financial burdens that threatened the sector from green electricity production are from the table .
the German Steel Industry ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) , says Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the German Steel Industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really happy that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the European Commission initially planned to ask the steel producers who use gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption .
according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel told WA@@ Z that there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when the generators are replaced in the steel works are an EEG lev@@ elling of 20 percent .
but even this will not be raised in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission on its own electricity generation .
this means that the status quo of the current regulation is largely written down .
Gabriel &apos;s successful effort for the steel industry is of particular importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Steel is Future &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; this is a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others must follow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even in the reform of emissions legislation , climate and employment targets are to be weigh@@ ed off , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IG Metall chief Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has suffered under over@@ capacity and considerable price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008 .
last year , the situation was exac@@ erb@@ ated by the world &apos;s largest producer of China throwing tons of steel on the world market in the face of the weaker domestic demand .
European manufacturers acc@@ use Chinese steel companies price dump@@ ing .
in the course of this spring , the situation has been somewhat relaxed .
on the one hand , imported import duties on import steel have effect , on the other hand economic prospects in China have brigh@@ tened up .
it is not clear how sustainable the price over@@ haul is .
the German industry leader Th@@ ys@@ senk@@ ru@@ pp remained cau@@ tious on Thursday .
last but not least , the prices would have stagn@@ ated again .
the industry re@@ acts to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
at the end Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp did not want to exclude the closure of individual works .
around 8@@ ,000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015 .
in July , despite rising prices and increasing orders , German steel producers are cau@@ tious .
with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year &apos;s month , as Steel Wirtschafts@@ vereinigung announced on Friday .
after a short increase in May , the quantity produced went back to one another for the second month .
since the beginning of the year , production has been two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
in the coming months , the association expects an improved order situation with a rising output .
community , spirit , health : singing is good for sen@@ iors
the singing has accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp to her entire life : as a young girl she was in the school choir , she occupied the subject of music at the teacher &apos;s college , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a sen@@ iors choir .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; singing moves me - emo@@ tionally and physically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she describes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and overall more lively , she says .
by the way , she does something good in her health and mind .
because singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors , Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler says about the German senior league .
most sen@@ iors sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded people the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler .
through regular meetings , sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and cultivate social contacts .
because often social and family structures dissolve in old age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speaking and organizing , to be able to leave and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of toge@@ ther@@ ness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in the positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
as a result , sen@@ iors train a deep and controlled respir@@ ation .
he who regularly challenges his lungs doesn &apos;t get out of the bust too quickly in everyday life .
even when it comes to getting the sound of the voice in old age , singing is an ideal hobby .
on older people , singing often has a very special effect , says Ursul@@ a L@@ enz from the Federal Association of the Senior Ci@@ tiz@@ ens Organis@@ ations .
in the older generations common singing had a much higher priority , it belonged to everyday life , both at school and in leisure , it explains .
L@@ enz often watches that singing or listening to songs in older people w@@ akes up many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth .
through lyrics and especially melodies , people with dementia are un@@ aware of long @-@ lying events .
in singing , the head also demands special performance , explains L@@ enz .
to focus simultaneously on one &apos;s own voice and to a given rhythm and to adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
especially elderly people , who live alone , practice not only to concentrate on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition you get through singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ este@@ em also grows through singing in the choir .
to show oneself : if I practise for something long , I will get better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens .
good reasons to start singing , so there is enough .
those who want to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks they have little talent , L@@ enz advises .
you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who already hears when a sound goes wrong ?
looking for the right offer , sen@@ iors have different options , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
if someone sings from the circle of acquain@@ tan@@ ces in a sen@@ sei &apos;s choir , one can simply join .
many cities also offer over@@ views of the choirs in the area .
those who want to sing in a ch@@ ur@@ ch@@ ly choir can contact the church or the church leader directly .
many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet .
if you do not have access to the Internet , your family , friends or neighbours can ask for help with internet research .
those who want to sing should necessarily join a choir , advises H@@ ac@@ kler .
singing does the soul well and has something liber@@ ating - that applies to all ages .
cats react more sensi@@ tively than han@@ go@@ vers on the cri@@ es of the young
bi@@ ologists have studied in Hannover , which effect the herd of k@@ itt@@ ens has grown on adult animals .
to her surprise , the mi@@ thing also did not let the males cold - however they always beha@@ ved in contrast to the females always the same .
female cats can recognize the degree of patho@@ gen of k@@ itt@@ ens on the face of the little ones .
they respond by ten percent faster to l@@ utes of k@@ itt@@ ens , who have found themselves in great need , such as scientists from the Veter@@ inary Academy and the Hannover Medical School ( MH@@ H ) .
males also react to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - however always the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously the acoustic differences between the mi@@ sting of less and strongly excited young are either not percep@@ tible or not of importance &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of MH@@ H . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a previous study , the research team had already found that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens cri@@ es differ with the ur@@ gency of their need@@ iness .
a total of nine adult males and eight females were observed from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the MH@@ H .
they were performed for a row of babies , taken out of the litter box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ ams of more excited k@@ itt@@ ens , which were raised in addition .
the researchers maintain their results in spite of the small sample for meaningful results .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all females , even those who haven &apos;t had their own offspring , re@@ acted differently to the cri@@ es , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they turned faster to the driver when this rep@@ ut@@ ations were played by the very excited k@@ itt@@ ens .
this ability may possibly be inn@@ ate or develop with the sexually mature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the males responded at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , scientists have repeatedly investigated the reactions of women and men to baby sounds .
some studies also showed that women were more sensitive to babies , no matter if they were pregnant or not , the bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported .
Po@@ dol@@ ski resorts to Super@@ cup with &quot; Gala &quot;
Hak@@ an Sü@@ dum@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
an arrest warrant has been issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ dau@@ r in Turkey .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after the attempted put@@ sch , again an important football match takes place in Turkey .
before the du@@ el of the arch@@ ri@@ vals between Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ sky Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay , Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual . &quot;
even with the suspension of the state of emergency after the coup attempt in July , the government , the daily life of normal citizens , should not be affected .
this does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len movement , responsible for the attempted put@@ sch .
at the same time , football is not am@@ bus@@ hed .
the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office issued an arrest warrant against the former star Hak@@ an Sü@@ dum@@ r .
accordingly , the South Africa living in America is now accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ dum@@ r is said to be the follow@@ er of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan .
although the state of emergency imposed for 90 days is still valid until October , it actually does not have any impact on the lives of most Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the noc@@ tur@@ nal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy guards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in public places all over the country declared Erdo@@ gan on Wednesday for an end . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - split into supporters and opponents of Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the workers &quot; club Bes@@ ik@@ tas are traditionally not among the friends of the president .
but what unites the Gro@@ s of Turks in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military put@@ ts .
even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ky@@ ta .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will arrive especially again on Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Cologne in the past season proved its sporty value : with 17 fo@@ ols and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old completed his first playing time as a top scor@@ er of his association .
in the final game against F@@ ener@@ bah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 victory hit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asked him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured the tro@@ phy to his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season for the record master found a conci@@ li@@ atory conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the pre @-@ round @-@ K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; f@@ arewell to the Europa League early . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the South of Li@@ g it only reached sixth place .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have done this and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for masters Bes@@ ik@@ tas the year of playing went better .
especially thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who laid the basis for the 14th title with 26 seasonal hits as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ ment@@ enk@@ ö@@ nig .
this is also the reason why the fans hope to return to the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
at the same time , the Gom@@ ez , under contract and at Bes@@ ic@@ ta , had only announced that he would not return to the country after his European vacation because of the political situation in the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he just has to say it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the specialist magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Club Director Fi@@ kre@@ t Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to do so , the stri@@ ker would have to be ready to ren@@ ounce about a third of his annual salary at 7.5 million euros , Or@@ man noted : &quot; we cannot pay its salary at Florence . &quot;
despite dop@@ ing : these athletes still have med@@ als opportunities at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin was already locked twice due to dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ ova is not allowed to start in Rio .
other out@@ performed athle@@ tics sinners can only laugh about it - they fight in Rio for med@@ als .
the topic of dop@@ ing remains the head@@ lines at the Rio Olympics .
the Russian float in Juli@@ ja Je@@ fi@@ m@@ yo@@ va , who had filed their initial right before the games after a dop@@ ing barrier , was pi@@ ped out mer@@ cil@@ essly with her start ( 100 meters chest ) .
there was a whi@@ m@@ si@@ cal scenery : with a laid smile she was still in the hall and had provoked her appearance .
when it was clear that it won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out into a jubil@@ ation storm .
but there are many other sports@@ men who are going to the Rio Olympics in spite of dop@@ ing past .
here is an overview :
Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ relay / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is among the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics .
he was locked twice already for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
since its spell , the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ world champion is even faster than before , he is the number one in the world over 100 metres in 9.@@ 80 seconds and is regarded as the greatest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ An@@ n F@@ ras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ relay / Jam@@ ai@@ ka ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven @-@ time champion had to sit down for six months after taking the pain of Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
after surgery , she had severe tooth@@ ache , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended .
Sandra Per@@ ko@@ vic ( Dis@@ cus / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the 2012 Olympic champion , world champion from 2013 and European champi@@ onships , was tested positively on the banned stimul@@ ant drug meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine from 2010 to 2016 .
Per@@ ko@@ vic denied the scientific ing@@ es@@ tion and was locked for six months .
the four far@@ th@@ est th@@ rows this year go to the account of the great gold fav@@ ori@@ tin .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ relay / USA ) : the Beijing Olympics Champion and twice World Champion at over 400 m , had been positive in 2010 and had been locked for 21 months .
a remedy for penis enlargement was responsible , eu@@ red mar@@ rying .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 m .
Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( hammer throw , Belarus ) : hardly any ath@@ lete was subsequently recognized as many med@@ als afterwards .
so T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later , after he was diagnosed with testosterone @-@ dop@@ ing .
the 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to release Olympia @-@ Silver 2004 because of ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the European title 2006 because of testosterone deficiency .
he also received a bronze medal from the 2008 Olympic Games , due to a judgment of the International Sport Court of CA@@ S .
at 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m he ranks second in the world rank@@ ings .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walk , China ) : the world record artist and Gold@@ fav@@ ori@@ tin was first tested in May but may still start in Rio .
in the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champion , indications of taking a forbidden dietary supplement have been found , the ban of World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing agency WA@@ DA fell mild and ran already on July 13th .
bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian viol@@ ates - Sever@@ al dead
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , spokes@@ man for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning .
she suffered cutting wounds and had been treated in hospital , but I had already left it .
their journey home was planned for the beginning of September .
whether from the further explo@@ sions on the holiday island Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ um@@ phon , Austrian citizens are also still unclear .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities , so Schn@@ ul@@ ll .
at about 200 kilometres south of Bangkok &apos;s capital , Hu@@ a H@@ in explo@@ ded two bombs on Thursday evening .
according to the police , a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
on Friday morning , two explo@@ sives went up again , according to the authorities , another man was killed .
a bomb det@@ onation was reported in the morning also by Ph@@ u@@ ket .
a taxi driver was injured in the det@@ onation near the beach resort of Pat@@ ong , which was popular with vac@@ ation@@ ers .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ eastern coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded which killed a municipal cler@@ k .
according to the authorities , the explo@@ sives had gone into the air in a flower bed in front of the Re@@ vier of the Co@@ ast@@ al Police .
finally , det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast and in Ch@@ um@@ phon on the south @-@ east coast demanded several wounded .
from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bomb attacks bear the same hand@@ writing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said army general Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ met@@ av@@ ee Friday morning before journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that it is a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is too early to express themselves in possible motives - but most likely it is about the actions of Muslim rebels .
Thai media also wanted to see a pattern that is typical for the bom@@ b@@ ings of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not related to the Islam@@ ist uprising or with international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sab@@ otage , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is rather assumed that the bombs were placed by opponents of the ruling military j@@ un@@ ta .
in recent days , the authorities would have kept secret references to upcoming attacks in the south of the country - but they were not informed about the exact time and places .
it is still unclear which group is behind the attacks .
the police instructed their officials all over the country to increase security around important government buildings as well as airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts .
in Thailand , there are always smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but most of the time they are not directed against tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace used for years by Thailand &apos;s King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bo@@ l Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
according to the popular bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends on its homepage to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities .
high security risk ( Level 3 ) applies to the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surroundings .
after disputes between security forces and Muslim populations , no need to travel to these provinces will be dis@@ cour@@ aged .
increased safety risk ( level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday followed a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution dra@@ fted by the military j@@ un@@ ta .
this gives the military great influence also in the coming years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; j@@ un@@ ta boss and prime minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said the bombs were an attempt to create chaos , while the country moves towards stability , an improvement in economic conditions and tourism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the military un@@ ta , who had seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody un@@ rest , resist@@ ed itself to restore the kingdom to stability and order .
however , it has not been possible for the military to get a grip on the rebellion of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country .
more than 6@@ 500 people have been killed in the conflict .
almost a year ago , 20 people were killed in Bangkok at a stop on a popular Hin@@ du S@@ hr@@ ine - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t plot of the country &apos;s recent history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is targeted at the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after several national offices , the constitutional prot@@ ectors in the Con@@ federation have also placed the group under observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see evidence of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for efforts against the liberal democratic constitution , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Constitutional Director Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ aß of the German press agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus immigrants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are diff@@ used in extrem@@ ist ways .
that is why we are now observing the movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it turns against &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration , &quot; and the &quot; loss of one &apos;s identity by alien@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; constitutional Prot@@ ectors in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thur@@ in@@ gia - already observe the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identi@@ ties &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ aß said his authority was closely coordinated with the state offices . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups like the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identi@@ fiable movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are trying to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chairman of the Constitutional Court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in general , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to address them with language @-@ appropriate language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
the fac@@ ul@@ ties of Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not an advertisement for one &apos;s own cause .
propaganda should appeal to people emo@@ tionally .
young people are particularly vulnerable .
this is dangerous .
last but not least , there were reports from several federal states on the contacts of the &quot; Identi@@ ty &quot; to Af@@ D politicians .
Ma@@ aß said , he didn &apos;t know anything about that .
possible contacts of this species are only relevant for the constitutional complaint at a certain point .
it depends on whether the party - in this case - the Af@@ D - will change its target direction by certain persons who are extrem@@ ist , change their direction and become so extrem@@ ist .
the decisive factor here is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party .
this is not apparent .
with regard to the significant increase in legal @-@ motivated offen@@ ders and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and asylum seek@@ ers , Ma@@ aß said he would not speak of new right terrorism in this context .
but we have found in recent years that there can be right @-@ wing structures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was the group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Old School Society &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or the Frei@@ taler Group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it may well be that other right @-@ wing groups or small groups form the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee homes or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives .
but a nationwide or pan @-@ European control of right @-@ wing terrorism cannot be seen .
the existing groups have emerged on the regional level or in social networks .
worried about the fact that many offen@@ ders went to the account of people who had not appeared before in the right scene .
this is wor@@ rying .
many of the susp@@ ects of attacks on asylum lod@@ ges have previously not been known as criminals , politically motivated offen@@ ders or supporters of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people have thus committed crimes that had previously been politically indiffer@@ ent or elected for example , CD@@ U , SPD or Left , which , however , have been radic@@ alised by right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist sentim@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes the Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
not always do the Olympic or world records determine the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the bold performance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te during the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
in the Aqu@@ atics Center the slightly over@@ wei@@ ghty s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia sw@@ am so slowly that he could no longer be seen in the TV pictures .
he simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut was selected .
in social networks , Hab@@ te became viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first race with a gap of 48 seconds and finished the 59@@ th place of 59 star@@ ters .
but it was rather his not exactly sporty figure , which attracted the attention of the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still takes part in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ian received a special start right from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ represented countries more famous .
as most sports@@ men run in Ethiopia , Hab@@ te just wanted to do something different .
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
the first nick@@ names were quick to make the lap .
some media referred to him as &quot; Ro@@ bel of the W@@ hale . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; following an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prosperity b@@ ump &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the English tab@@ lo@@ id &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was fun with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his time , he first struck a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meter fre@@ estyle , played no role .
compar@@ isons with Eric the E@@ el were also drawn .
in the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney , the run by Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i took care of media attention .
unforgettable was the appearance of the bu@@ oy@@ ancy from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to compete over 100 metres of free style alone .
M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was then fired at the time .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned only eight months before Olympic and had never completed such a long distance before the competition .

Ger@@ ets@@ ried - The owner of a shop in the New Square has been fo@@ al .
according to the police , the 67 @-@ year @-@ old Ger@@ ets@@ rie@@ der@@ in had left their business on Monday at 5.@@ 30 p.m. and forgot to close a window on the ground floor .
when she returned the next morning at 8.@@ 15 o &apos;clock , about 250 Euro had disappeared from the cash desk .
traces of the perpet@@ r@@ ator could not be found .
video surveillance is also not available .
Tr@@ ump does not see the threat of voting so closely
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump is speaking at an election campaign in Florida .
if there is nothing with the election to the US president , Donald Tr@@ ump already has an alternative video .
he then goes on holiday .
if Donald Tr@@ ump loses the US presidential election in November , it doesn &apos;t matter to him : &quot; ultimately it will either work out , or I have a very nice , long holiday , &quot; said the Republi@@ can candidate in a telephone interview with the US television station CN@@ BC .
if it was not sufficient for him for reasons of political correctness , this was fine , said Tr@@ ump .
he described the US President Barack Obama and the Democrats of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist Islamic State ( IS ) .
within his party , more and more resistance was formed .
post increases in trade with electric transpor@@ ters
an electric delivery vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other firms on the vehicle is obviously great .
the post office plans to sell their electric vehicle Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter as well .
shortly , the Group wants to start trading with the transpor@@ ter .
the post office will also be offering its electric vehicles on the free car market as of next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to enter the sale to third parties , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a post @-@ speaker on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company has been checking for months whether they will sell their self @-@ developed Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter with which letters and pack@@ ets are delivered , even to other companies .
post @-@ board Jürgen Ger@@ der had said that there are always inquiries , such as by craftsmen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the news magazine &quot; Der Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Bon@@ ner Group wants to enter the mass production of the vehicles shortly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in post @-@ production , the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and shift .
Ger@@ des announced that the Group wants to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and make a complete conversion to environmentally friendly vehicles in the long term .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will make a very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can imagine that we reloc@@ ate the entire fleet .
the Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter is active on Germany &apos;s roads since 2014 .
GF@@ RP leadership steps down after dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures
the consumer research company G@@ f@@ K exchanges his boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the back@@ cuts came suddenly - but not surprisingly .
the difficult situation of the market research company G@@ f@@ K suggests that the chair by Chairman Matthias Hart@@ mann will be all the more uncertain as to the longer the successes promised by him .
tur@@ mo@@ il at the head of the Nuremberg market research company G@@ f@@ K : after again dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures and the res@@ ignation of corporate governance , the number five of the industry is facing a new beginning .
GF@@ RP member of the Management Board wants to leave the company at the end of the year .
the Chairman of the Supervisory Board of Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ert already res@@ ig@@ ns from the Supervisory Board with effect from 12 September .
as early as September 1 , the management of the Management Board will take over the previous board member Gerhard Haus@@ erk@@ inger .
he shall officially take over the function of a &quot; spokes@@ man , &quot; until a successor is found for Hart@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the company called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; different views &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the long @-@ term business policy orientation as the reason for the res@@ ign@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details did not want to mention a spokes@@ man on Friday .
it is still unclear who will lead the market research company in the future .
in investor circles it was said on Friday , at last the disappointment was big at the shareholders over the continued success of the restructuring measures introduced a few years ago .
Mr Hart@@ mann has been at the G@@ f@@ K summit since 2011 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fruits of restructuring have not yet to be seen after 5 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the last bad G@@ f@@ K business figures , every shareholder is at some point rest@@ less .
&quot; if that were the case with BMW , that would make the qu@@ and@@ ts so , &quot; he said .
after set@@ backs in the previous quarters , the company could not stop its loss in the second quarter of 2016 .
at 36@@ 1.2 million euros , sales were 6.@@ 1 percent below the comparable year @-@ earlier quarter .
sales in the first half @-@ year tot@@ alled 7@@ 21.@@ 2 million euros by 3.4 percent .
earnings in the second quarter primarily imp@@ acted the un@@ disclosed value of the company in view of its difficult economic situation .
the impairment charges of 139 million euros , which were necessary in the Consumer Experience business unit , contributed to the Group &apos;s loss of EUR 14@@ 8.2 million .
in the second quarter of 2015 , the G@@ f@@ K generated a net income of 19.@@ 7 million .
accidents - Bus slides in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ hör@@ n in dit@@ ch : eight injured
in the event of an accident involving 43 senior citizens as passengers , eight people were injured in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ hör@@ n ( district Aur@@ ich ) on Thursday .
two of the in@@ mates suffered severe injuries , shared the police .
according to her data , the 66 @-@ year @-@ old coach of the coach of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to devi@@ ate from one vice , partly on the counter @-@ road .
the bus came to the right from the road and sli@@ d into a dit@@ ch , like a spokes@@ woman for Police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the location of the bus , people could not leave the bus independently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade liber@@ ated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and a ambul@@ ance car came to the accident scene on the national road 2 .
the unexpected travellers were brought back from a regular bus to the Kr@@ um@@ m@@ hör@@ n district of P@@ ew@@ sum .
there they should wait for a spare @-@ bus from the travel company .
the investig@@ ators asked the truck drivers and possible witnesses to report to the police .
as of October 1 , 2016 , the fees for each cubic metre of wastewater will be 2.@@ 10 euros for the new village / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ h@@ ahl / Wel@@ h@@ pole 3.@@ 44 euro ; for Zul@@ te mountain / Lin@@ den@@ berg / L@@ opp 3.@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 26 Euro ) and for az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 euros ( until now 2.@@ 18 euros ) .
at the plant in Az@@ endorf the waste water charge will increase again at the latest when appropriate improvement measures are necessary .
after a slu@@ gg@@ ish calculation , the sewage price in Az@@ endorf is then at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic metre .
as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , when approval of the budget was established by the Council Office Kul@@ mb@@ ach , there were under@@ cover for these sewage plants .
due to legal foundations , the Kas@@ endorf market is obliged to operate the systems cost @-@ effectively .
as of October 1 , 2016 , the citizens as well as the industrial and industrial companies from Wel@@ h@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ te berg will have to go deeper into the pur@@ se .
the increase in fee amounts between 48 and 67 percent .
as Director of Management Herbert Schmidt presented to the body , a new calculation of fees for sewage treatment facilities of the market community was necessary .
over the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - and overl@@ app@@ ings from the previous calculation period can also be compensated .
Schmidt founded the serious increases in fee with the fact that there were relatively small facilities with a very low waste water intake between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year in all three wastewater facilities .
for example , due to the low distribution base , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact .
in addition , the volume of sewage in all three plants is slightly dec@@ lining .
in spite of its age refur@@ bish@@ ment and repair expenses , all three systems will continue to have a considerable extent due to their age .
the facility in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the plants for world food , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ te Mountain , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp almost 20 years .
Schmidt explained that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to damage in the Az@@ endorf waste water plant .
for nearly 20 years , the first sewage slu@@ dge had to be dispos@@ ed of at the pump station Wel@@ h@@ ahl , and after nearly 20 years of operation the first sewage slu@@ dge had to be dispos@@ ed of , the sewage slu@@ dge dispos@@ ed of and an additional ventilation can be installed in order to comply with the water regulations in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these extraordinary expenses resulted in the continued maintenance and maintenance costs that must be taken into account in the new calculation period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which were still clearly below the current level of the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012 .
stone houses made it clear that at the low se@@ wer@@ age in the three plants , the expenses for the operation and maintenance were &quot; full . &quot;
thanks to Schmidt , the market community has been spar@@ ed from major maintenance costs in the waste water facilities over the past 20 years .
according to stone houses , the situation for the aforementioned equipment will continue to be prec@@ arious in the long run , particularly as the supply area of the Fri@@ esen@@ bach@@ tal sewage @-@ purpose association is not to be extended because these facilities are defici@@ ent .
Bulgaria records inflation for the first time in 8 months
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year , as positive 0.2 % were posted .
the average annual inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 amounted to 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.2 % .
in July 2016 , a price increase of the following groups of consumer goods was observed in comparison to the previous month : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1,7 % ) ; transportation ( 1.8 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6,@@ 3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
prices fell in clothing and footwear ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0,1 % ) .
the prices remained as in the previous month with alcoholic drinks and tobacco ; flats , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged .
Snap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect critici@@ zed as Asian carto@@ on
Snap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some ob@@ servers say that it is in@@ sensitive to races .
with its filter tool , Snap@@ chat allows about 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identi@@ ties in such a way that already borders the absurd .
you can transform yourself into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting .
the filters are un@@ bl@@ unted , self @-@ prop@@ elled tools that generate more than 30 million improved sel@@ fies per day .
all in@@ accur@@ acies are sent to the public .
in the past , Snap@@ chat filters have critici@@ zed critics in which they were accused of using the app black@@ face conveyor or white skin as a beauty ideal .
when it struck a filter this week , which gave them slot eyes , false teeth and blo@@ ated che@@ eks , some critics called it a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; ja@@ un@@ dice . &quot;
they asked themselves whether these repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a greater problem that the company has diversity .
the news and ou@@ trage were widespread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mo@@ ther@@ board , one day after Snap@@ chat announced that it had de@@ activated the feature .
the company offered an ap@@ ology : the filter was intended as homage to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced rac@@ ism reminded the filter of hur@@ t@@ ful c@@ lich@@ és .
others rejected the anim@@ e comparison .
in an e @-@ mail Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student whose twe@@ ets were widespread over the photos that the filter was &quot; inj@@ uri@@ ous and bar@@ ren said unpleasant . &quot;
she added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very contra@@ sting Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and filter effects .
it shows that the filter is not yel@@ low@@ ish , but that the yellow face has been pulled into the degra@@ ding extreme .
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural pride .
American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration struggle , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in hand .
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats large audience of young people - who in terms of race more diverse than their older counter@@ parts - could rather assume sensitivity to expect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats filters creates a picture that is insul@@ ting for a user , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is much more difficult for such things to stay un@@ noticed , when it was the case , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday Z@@ hu , who worked as a product manager and engineer for media , decided to delete her Snap@@ chat account and asked others to do the same .
in an essay for media and in a phone interview , she said that ra@@ cial issues reflect a lack of diversity in the setting practices of Snap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu also critici@@ zed the big part white , only male leadership and ended their essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; said Chin@@ es@@ ich @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable in order to say something about it . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint that has largely left Snap@@ chat un@@ answered .
the company does not publish figures on the diversity of its staff and indicates its status as a private company .
on Thursday , the Snap@@ chat refused to discuss the cultural background of its employees , but according to a spokes@@ man , the company recently set up a personnel manager focusing on represented population groups and on internal integration efforts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in turn , Z@@ hu said that she will leave her &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Snap@@ chat &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; account and added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not O.@@ K. &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
military leadership fal@@ si@@ fies IS@@ IS intelligence , set up Committee of the Congress
military personnel of the United States Central Command have changed intelligence to draw up an optim@@ istic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , when the actual conditions were allowed on site , an investigation committee of the Congress reported in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the Republi@@ can Committee of the Force Forces Committee , secret services committees and the military budget committee , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command Intelligence analysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their assessments on US efforts in the struggle against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , shortly Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; intelligence information typically deter@@ red by high @-@ ranking Cent@@ Com com@@ man@@ ders regularly recorded a positive image of US efforts against terrorism as it allowed the actual conditions on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence services , &quot; a newspaper article cited the report .
&quot; what happened at the Cent@@ com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; K@@ en Cal@@ vert , a Republi@@ can member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , noted .
the leadership mistake in the Cent@@ Com is sufficient to reach the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report presents detailed structural problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces .
although there is no direct evidence that government tips under Obama have given instructions to change the reports , it shows how analysts exposed the pressure from their superi@@ ors to draw an optim@@ istic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements and statements in front of Congress were clearly more positive than the facts . &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ Com employee publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could start in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; after months of investigation , it is so clear . &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Con@@ gres@@ s@@ man from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement .
from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the Central Command revised the intelligence reports to play down the danger of IS@@ IS in Iraq .
the Republi@@ cans called the Task Force into life after they were admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed information as the investigations will continue .
in addition , further investigations of Cent@@ Com reports are underway by the Secretary @-@ General of the Ministry of Defence .
democratic members of the Intelligence Committee released their own findings on Thursday , which coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 Cent@@ Com created a moder@@ ately restricted trial for the creation of intelligence assessments on IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; announced the highest level democr@@ at in the Committee , member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives Adam B. Schiff , in an opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Schiff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delayed the release of intelligence reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sh@@ amed the moral of analysts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave exc@@ essively little space for diver@@ ging opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats stated that there was no evidence of the intervention of the White House in the Cent@@ Com analy@@ st with regard to a &quot; definite political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigations were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported a investigation by the Pentagon &apos;s General In@@ spec@@ tor who was taken up by Cent@@ Com analysts .
l@@ t. C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon press officer , stated in a statement that the Defense Department would not comment on reports of Congress , while investigations by the General In@@ spec@@ tor are still under way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he also stated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ ging opinions on the interpretation of complex data , and that intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcomed a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investigations have gone beyond the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a claim that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) .
the accus@@ ations of last year , however , raised the question to what extent President Obama can rely on Central Command for the app@@ rais@@ al of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State is remember@@ ing disputes of more than ten years ago , when a Cent@@ Com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a document about how the then government under George W. Bush just fores@@ aw a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to worry about the consequences of the 2003 invasion .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the revol@@ t against the current reporting of the Islamic State .
last year , the team headed by Mr. Hoo@@ ker , according to government officials , states that contrary to the government &apos;s statements , air@@ strikes against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State would not have any significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , as these provisional refin@@ eries had put into operation to sell oil on the black market .
this knowledge , however , was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ Com &apos;s former commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critici@@ zed by members of the legislature because of his exc@@ essively positive assessment of the situation at a hearing in front of the Senate .
general Austin retired in April and was replaced with the Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the United States wins a fourth match in the field ho@@ ckey of women , a show@@ down with the United Kingdom stands before
one day after hitting three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American Women &apos;s Field ho@@ ckey team in a match on Thursday against India that the American women won with 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two games should actually be a memorable achievement , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she could not remember that ever done .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I am not one of the people who keep their doors in mind .
however , they know : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are equally in their group with the Brit@@ ons on the first place , who remain un@@ defeated after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group of six teams .
first placed , the strong Dutch will take a little longer to lead the other group .
whatever the game on Saturday , Americans have triggered a surprising whi@@ rl@@ wind through their success story , four years after they ended up in the last of 12 places at the last London games .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a ho@@ ckey player in hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
she missed the Olympic Games in 2008 , because she could not qualify for the cad@@ re .
then came the year 2012 when everything went wrong for her and her team .
in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engli@@ sh@@ man , coach of the National Team and thus began to turn things better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we didn &apos;t have the work place in London that we have now .
we have been able to pull the ru@@ dder completely .
on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the door ri@@ gs in the first half of the game with a back@@ lash out of the s@@ ut@@ ure .
India went into play without winning the tournament , but the team was surprisingly tough and held the score from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands .
she performed a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved to the middle and le@@ aked the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ z@@ al@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the tournament for the door@@ keeper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games .
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &apos;re in a good position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
amid the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of tramp@@ ol@@ ines
wherever you are , how late it is , there are the Olympics .
the events in Rio de Janeiro are constantly and in@@ es@@ capable , a fast relay between competition and aspir@@ ation .
it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod , which is passed from the w@@ rist@@ band to the s@@ wimm@@ ers to the tri@@ ath@@ lete .
you can &apos;t turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour &apos;s conversation in the coffee shop without hearing about Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a s@@ warm of women with dimples , could certainly have been under these well @-@ known names sent to Prime Time , built by sponsors and feel @-@ good TV advertising if he were a swi@@ mmer , gymn@@ ast or even fen@@ cer .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , is fighting gold at the Olympic tramp@@ ol@@ ines .
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate every event .
further from the centre , some of which are in the shadow are the sports that are not generally accepted : pist@@ ol shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the chest swimming and may it reign for a long time .
but if I should make modest reasons for my particular favourite , then let me draw your attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline .
although the jumping net has already been an olymp@@ ic event since 2000 , when it made its debut in Sydney , the last 16 years have been so spar@@ sely aware that many of them , I had asked , did not know that it is an Olympic sport at all .
this could also be regional ignorance .
although the USA sent athletes to the competition , there has never been a medal in jumping on the trampoline and until 2012 had an ath@@ lete who made it to the final round .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to divide the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadian women for the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada defend their gold medal from London this year .
jumping on the trampoline has a certain exterior charm , partly because it sounds more suitable for an un@@ enligh@@ tened ear for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ School that sounds for the Olympic Games .
at this point , I should admit that I am not an expert , but only an experienced enthusi@@ ast .
it has humor@@ istic potential - the carto@@ on@@ ist trem@@ bling of his never @-@ ending impact - but also the Gra@@ zie of gymn@@ as@@ tics and diving , the two sports that it essentially combines .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trampoline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originates from the Spanish El trampoline , which means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spr@@ ing@@ board &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
emerging vic@@ tors jumping on a giant trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and need a number of falling movements ( turning , pi@@ ke and sal@@ tos ) before they land on their feet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are assessed according to official Olympic program according to design , degree of difficulty and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flight time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women compete against each other in Rio .
the most common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ sts have to continue in their quest for gold , faster , up and down , sometimes up to the goal , sometimes down and down , up and down on the playground .
they not only hunt the finish line or the starting wall , but also another highlight in tel@@ ev@@ ised transmission : the World or the Olympic Park .
the goal @-@ oriented pursuit is no@@ bel , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even touch a spect@@ ator at tears .
but it is also what I feel fati@@ gu@@ ing myself when watching these games .
the trampoline offers a resp@@ ite .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
he or she colli@@ des , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down , then effort@@ lessly upwards .
here too there is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves into the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity .
it &apos;s as Zen as the competition for the Olympic Games can only be .
the qualification and final rounds of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 1 pm Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13.@@ 00 .
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the final rounds as part of a afternoon block on both days starting at 14.@@ 00 .

&quot; one generation protests &quot; in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the USA
violent protests in Ethiopia
prot@@ esters calling for political changes in Ethiopia met the government &apos;s violent resistance .
witnesses testified that dozens of prot@@ esters were killed during the clas@@ hes with the police during firing changes .
is Ethiopia going to collapse right now ?
over the past ten years , it has been one of Africa &apos;s most stable countries , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy .
but in the last few months protests against the government sh@@ ook the country and spread out more and more areas .
last week thousands of people stor@@ med the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
according to human rights organisations , the government &apos;s response was ru@@ th@@ less .
witnesses stated that polic@@ emen shot and killed un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
videos being circul@@ ating about the protests , probably from the last or the beginning of this year , show how security officers beat young people with sticks while they were forced to make a stand against a wall .
the head of the UN Human Rights Authority is now calling for a detailed investigation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the director of the Horn of Africa of the International Cris@@ is Group , a research group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
American military and intelligence services work closely with Ethiop@@ ians to combat terrorism across the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if ever , get so much Western help .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a considerable pace .
his infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commu@@ ter train in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
the roads are generally quiet , safe and clean .
even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have consistently led the government &apos;s oppression - the opposition in the country was restricted , while dissi@@ dents were effectively sil@@ enced .
many were sent to exile or in prison , killed or driven into the des@@ erts of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you supp@@ ress people and don &apos;t have other options except to protest , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ la , a lecturer in Central Ethiopia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the youth protests .
one generation protests .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stran@@ gl@@ ehold on the power of the ruling coalition .
following a far @-@ reaching election last year , the ruling party and its allies were the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 per cent of the parliament .
at the same time , tensions along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea rise ; a struggle for this jag@@ ged , controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June .
analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the O@@ rom@@ o @-@ Liber@@ ation Front or the National Liber@@ ation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , who have been defeated more or less in recent years , can use tur@@ mo@@ il and be able to arm themselves again .
several factors explain why feelings of bitter@@ ness explo@@ de after years of dr@@ ink@@ ly hair@@ s under the surface .
the first one seems harmless : smartphones .
only in the last few years , many Ethiop@@ ians have been able to communicate with the social media because cheaper smartphones were becoming more and more frequent and the internet services improved .
even if the government blocks the access to Facebook and Twitter , what it does at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people can still communicate via Internet pro@@ x@@ ies , which hide where they are .
several young Ethiop@@ ians stated that they were so prot@@ esting against protests .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia .
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
for e@@ ons of time , the Am@@ har@@ as , who mainly come from Ethiopia , prosp@@ ered in politics and economy , while they exploited the Oro@@ mos , many of which are Muslims and live in low@@ land areas .
but that is changing just as well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are going to coordinate under a screen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the largest protests took place in the Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos areas .
many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray who constitute about 6 percent of the population and who are dominant in the military , secret services , trade and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi &apos;s death .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was the Prime Minister until his death on a non @-@ publi@@ ci@@ zed illness in 2012 .
he was regarded as a tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think around corners .
analysts say that he was particularly well @-@ vers@@ ed in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and using special commis@@ sions to process enemies and to make them harmless .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime lacks this basic skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s new Prime Minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for a relatively obsc@@ ure reason to take the position of Mr Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of northern Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the South .
analysts say that he does not enjoy the trust of security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time Ethiopia experienced such a tur@@ mo@@ il in 2005 , after thousands of protests prot@@ ested , which , according to the information given by analysts , were apparently distra@@ c@@ ted by the government and then stolen .
during the ensu@@ ing ra@@ ids , many prot@@ esters were killed even if they were less than in the last months and that time of un@@ rest went relatively quickly .
development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new commu@@ ter train , as well as their meas@@ urable progress in fighting poverty .
but apparently this has not prevented the intensi@@ fication of the internal gri@@ ev@@ ance of Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it adop@@ ts a dangerous ethnic form .
last month prot@@ esters attacked Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ ish city , by Tig@@ ray and the hatred of the Tig@@ ray becomes more common in the social media .
analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flug over the neighboring Somalia , even though it recently announced that it has closed this base .
while the West clearly wants to support democracy , he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volati@@ le area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin ti@@ ght@@ rope walk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump declares his asser@@ tion Obama had founded IS@@ IS &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to dissi@@ p@@ ate the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking his repeatedly repeated claim that President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton were not serious about the &quot; founder &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State .
this clari@@ fication raised new questions on the communication skills of Republi@@ cans &apos;s presidential candidates , whether he is able to communicate clearly and intelli@@ gible to the American public .
it also brings his comrades who strive to take him in protection during an event@@ ful phase , in the peculiar position to declare statements he could not have meant .
having made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump , referring to the claim on Thursday , insist@@ ed that he really did not envis@@ age the president and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS .
but in an early morning T@@ we@@ et on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump said he was simply sar@@ c@@ astic .
the T@@ we@@ et was the opposite to the previous day Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a number of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation was completely serious .
when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ or@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tr@@ ump would help to we@@ aken the statement , remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama would destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate did not want to know anything about it .
the last storm of criticism har@@ ass Mr. Tr@@ ump , while he tried to ste@@ er the focus of his campaign because of falling survey figures on the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton talked about business situation in Mich@@ igan this week .
on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return to this subject again .
using Twitter , he warned that Clinton &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defence .
at the end of July he drew up strong criticism when he said that the Russians should h@@ ack Mrs. Clinton &apos;s emails , but later he explained &quot; Of course I meant the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic boundaries in politics and then back to demand .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his ways to test how certain messages are taken by his fans how they arrive , and then &quot; clarify &quot; depending on how the reaction falls . &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who ob@@ serves the language of both candidates .
but I also believe he is clever enough to keep his statements vag@@ ue enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways .
instead of def@@ using the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has assumed an even greater note , as its poll@@ s have declined further .
a new survey conducted by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ is , which was published on Friday , showed a leading lead in the states of North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump generally tries to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often accused his critics of distor@@ ting his statements or mis@@ understanding his hum@@ our .
but as he emphas@@ ises the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps Scher@@ ze has brought his loyal companions in the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be .
Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s most prominent advoc@@ ates , gave big effort to defend the candidate in a CN@@ N interview on Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani , so he was questioned about Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s statements about whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in this sense that before Obama IS an almost unknown , small organisation , he called them back @-@ bro@@ kers , completely wrong and that &apos;s why it happened because he with@@ drew the troops from Iraq .
most of the mainstream Republi@@ cans are trying to argue that the Obama administration , in which Mrs. Clinton served as Minister of Foreign Affairs , allowed IS@@ IS to spread the situation in the Middle East aggres@@ sively .
before the election campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of being convic@@ ted and pre@@ ju@@ dic@@ ed at each of his words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he de@@ fied the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , mis@@ erable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; television experts trying to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the Democrats s@@ ne@@ ered at Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s ap@@ ology as only proof that he was un@@ fit for the presidential office .
once crowded at the price of the market , Café gets back in Green@@ point
verb Cafe was a fo@@ ams café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , in which one could only pay cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi , but served good coffee for 15 years .
of course , the prices came from his Bed@@ ford Avenue store front .
soap Cher@@ ie &apos;s shop selling soap in the summer of 2014 sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
local residents rob@@ bed it as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ ana wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is changing , but I still can &apos;t believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel exemp@@ ted and Ver@@ b is now a soap business . &quot;
but if New York is changing , then it &apos;s also new inv@@ ocation .
a re@@ vit@@ alized Ver@@ b Cafe recently opened in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ standing associate of old cafés , owner and managing director of the new café .
he started working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and stayed there until the end .
when a customer offered to provide funds for a new office , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , retained a lot .
verb to use the same distributor for the bag@@ els bought the same espresso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps of the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
there are sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and cheese on the menu and there are gar@@ nis@@ hes like cap@@ ers and sau@@ ted onions .
there are natural rice dishes .
the café serves no beer , but there are fresh juices .
after nine months Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many old customers were also displaced by Willi@@ am@@ sburg rates , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently on a Sunday , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg earlier and regularly visited the verb .
even after being moved to Green@@ point , she would take the road .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the verb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ver@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; closed , she gave up the coffee for a while , she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was clear to me that it was in the club &apos;s coffee and culture that I liked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she drinks coffee again , even if she ordered a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on that day instead of her usual iced coffee , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been another long @-@ standing and loyal customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003 .
he went there before the work and inevitably ordered the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came to seven , every day like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and pick new ingredients into the menu .
today Ros@@ enthal is still getting his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had no res@@ ent@@ ment that the soap business took the old business premises .
in fact , the owners of So@@ ap Cher@@ ie offered a special soap for the coffee with the coffee @-@ bre@@ w@@ ed coffee of coffee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will go into their offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional Polish inhabitants of Green@@ points also accepted the café .
a new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he has planned to issue them soon so that his new neighbors feel welcome .
the site also has other advantages .
a local juice bar wants to fill and sell the cold bre@@ w@@ ed coffee .
there is a chance that the café is expanding to a neighboring building .
for many customers a new verb is enough to get their old favour@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said that he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coff@@ ees seemed like a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; I had to smell it , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a plentiful meal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his ascension to the president , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roos@@ ev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as a g@@ our@@ mets , President Roos@@ ev@@ elt had a passion for refined delic@@ acy of Fi@@ fth Avenue such as P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land water tur@@ tle soup .
its menu on this day was slightly more modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; said Jane Bri@@ man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was also a message to the Americans , how they should eat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food histori@@ ans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ es last book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was about Chinese cuisine in the USA , while Ziegel@@ man told about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side of the food perspective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; their latest collaboration , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A decent meal &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which will be published on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed culinary solidarity when they met a repor@@ ter at the Eisen@@ berg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , fast @-@ hear@@ ted snack at the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in store since the stock market crash in 1929 .
Bri@@ ck@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mixture ate .
when the repor@@ ter grilled h@@ ack@@ ers , this was the pair for a discussion about eating in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bri@@ ck@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and p@@ opp@@ y bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and something cheaper that stretches the ingredient .
imagine eating so many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve them as dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ ins .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have been lead in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before Great Depression the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an All @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
teams of women cooked for male ri@@ pen@@ es and it was served freshly baked paste for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was the Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; records the ways that the country was going to avoid being the land of land . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when eating for Americans was a central , ten@@ se issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e committed why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new budget was just as ten@@ se : mysterious foods such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ole were considered stap@@ le foods , the c@@ asser@@ ole as a &quot; wonderful way of re@@ ass@@ uring food lef@@ to@@ vers , &quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man noted , as chefs were able to hide un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dry fruit .
meat that was the centre of American cuisine for years has become a rarely preserved luxury .
peculiar compounds were tried out because a low calorie and nutri@@ tious satisfaction had priority over taste or even healthy cooking .
during their research for the book , which also includes recipes , bri@@ ck@@ man prepared a dish of this epoch , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter , too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a popular addition to lunch , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bri@@ ck@@ mann continues : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions do not fit together .
it was typical for many of the household recipes .
like never before , or ever since , domestic econom@@ ists - including Lou@@ ise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - addressed the country &apos;s eating habits .
by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; household women &quot; and the challenge to turn pamp@@ as such as cre@@ amy sp@@ agh@@ etti with car@@ rots into delicious meals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a feast of historic treats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in particular , the reports on the response of the government to the hungry citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver &apos;s L@@ ass @-@ C@@ ake food pose .
while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa peasant kitchen kitchen of his kitchen , he spoke out how the millions @-@ heavy man of the world he became to whom he became .
&quot; he liked continental cooking like fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; Co@@ e said .
he ate in an almost gil@@ ded dining room and bore a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was terri@@ bly realistic .
President Roos@@ ev@@ elt might have made the same mistake if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or asked him to make an example with his stomach .
as described in the book , the hypo@@ thesis of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavors caused by Mr@@ s Roos@@ ev@@ elt suggested that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most desolate . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression , dealing with food , was dis@@ car@@ ded as soon as the land returned to its legs .
the legacy is on our continuing focus on calories and food , said Ziegel@@ man , as well as how science was applied to food .
the couple had better understood eating habits of bri@@ ck@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law when writing the book - for example how they could not throw away food .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man remembered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she really made people ill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the fall of the wind .
after the plates had been cleaned up at Eisen@@ berg &apos;s , they and Co@@ e produced a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um dessert that President Roos@@ ev@@ elt ate at noon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is called Pr@@ une Whi@@ p , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ziegel@@ man , adding that it was a common trick to miss a modest recipe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no whi@@ pped cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everyone showed a bit of reluc@@ t@@ antly a spoon in the vis@@ cous , brown Gli@@ b@@ ber .
amaz@@ ingly , it ta@@ sted not bad .
Co@@ E took three times a night .
like a Can @-@ Do Bud@@ get@@ t@@ eller , he said to his wife , &quot; A couple of chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
killed in bomb attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar dedicated his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save lives .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime .
O@@ mar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civil defence group that , according to the Bild @-@ Zeitung , saved some 6@@ 0,000 people alive .
29@@ 00 volunteers put their own lives on the game to attract people from bom@@ bed homes and to help in the war zone .
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
O@@ mar was the group &apos;s face : a video of the civil guard , showing him about an 11 @-@ hour rescue of an inf@@ ant from the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syrians a shining symbol in the horror of war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he never saw himself as heroes , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; For me is the true ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I die to save lives , I think God will see a mart@@ yr in me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before O@@ mar itself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bombing ra@@ ids in Syria .
the helicop@@ ters jet@@ ti@@ son four barrel bombs over the Alz@@ hei@@ a district , one was filled with chlorine gas .
a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from short@@ ness of breath .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now removing the po@@ ison@@ ous rem@@ n@@ ants of the bomb , so that children do not play with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture c@@ ites his final words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to hit terrorists .
Gr@@ ön@@ land hai : the oldest verteb@@ ra@@ e is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland hair@@ s usually only come to the surface in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research ship S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats at about 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie only got offspring with 150 years of age .
the Gr@@ ön@@ land hai flo@@ ats on the ground of the North Atlantic , in an hour it comes on average just 1,@@ 220 meters .
only when it comes to it , the five @-@ meter @-@ long animal acceler@@ ates to a full 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed .
this lifestyle , characterised by slow@@ ness , seems to be a patent for a high age .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from Copenhagen University and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; Science &quot; at least a Greenland shar@@ k , which could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; ins@@ anity , &quot; Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein of the Max Planck Institute for Dem@@ ographic Research in Rostock comments on this life span , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates .
it was true that the evolutionary bi@@ ologist assumed long that Greenland &apos;s ha@@ y became stone .
only the evidence was missing .
Greenland &apos;s sh@@ arks are difficult to observe , after all they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually only appear in the winter on the surface .
researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland &apos;s sh@@ arks .
their slow @-@ pent@@ ine senses them , when they paid six animals with a transmitter in front of S@@ val@@ bard .
nevertheless , researchers found the remains of a seal in the stomach of an animal , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw@@ bone of a young polar bear .
they may ch@@ ase sleeping animals or pat@@ rol on the bottom of the polar sea and look for cad@@ aver that tor@@ tures from higher water layers .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues now studied 28 Greenland &apos;s sh@@ arks catching fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch from the depths of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centimet@@ ers long , while the largest measure was 50@@ 2 centimet@@ ers .
to determine the age of the animals , using the carbon @-@ 14 method , they analyzed the lens nucle@@ us of the sh@@ arks .
this centre of the eye lens is already created before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins contained in it will later no longer be renewed .
the two smallest sh@@ arks had notably much carbon @-@ 14 in the lens nucle@@ us .
their birth was therefore supposed to lie in the early 1960s , when nuclear weapons were carrying out larger quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere .
on the other hand , the lens nucle@@ us contained a small excess of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons trials in which the third smallest animal had a length of 220 cm . it is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 .
on the other hand , all the larger Greenland @-@ arks had normal carbon @-@ 14 quantities in their lin@@ sen@@ ic nucle@@ us , resulting from cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock showed an age of 3@@ 35 years for a 4@@ 93 @-@ cen@@ timeter @-@ long Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ hai , while the record shar@@ k should be 3@@ 92 years old with 50@@ 2 centimet@@ res .
that Greenland @-@ shar@@ k females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters was known .
now the researchers of the length could assign an age .
since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ res was probably at the threshold to sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years , Greenland &apos;s ha@@ y with the increase obviously can be at least one and a half centuries of time .
this is also likely to be world record for verteb@@ rates .
it is not a coinci@@ dence that such Meth@@ us@@ al@@ eme lives mostly in icy waters .
also the record holder , a 211 year old Greenland wh@@ ale , in whose bac@@ on at the neck put a 120 year old har@@ poon @-@ tip , was caught in front of Alaska .
due to the low temperatures , the organism of the animals living there often runs on as@@ par@@ agus fl@@ ames .
so they later mature - and age slower .
in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are often particularly large .
because the volume is growing much faster than its surface through which the animal loses heat .
the heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram of elephant .
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal is therefore more dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants as possible as possible , &quot; explains the evolutionary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein .
a very big animal should , on the other hand , invest his resources in a long life .
building plot in a double pack
in the recent session , the Municipal Council has focused on topics relating to building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with relief the Panel accepted the communication of Mayor Robert P@@ utz , that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally the marketing of recently reported hab@@ itation areas can begin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the question of land , plot and development issues and the applications for surve@@ ying could be clari@@ fied , the sale of land in residential areas &quot; Street lane &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( area Bin@@ der@@ straße - Construction section 1 ) is nothing more in the way of interested parties .
the municipal council is convinced that the areas of construction in the rural and quiet residential community attract young families and ru@@ th@@ less elderly alike .
as it was said , building volunteers can now report in the town hall as soon as the par@@ c@@ els are assigned , the municipal council is expected to be advised in its September session .
in order to make inquiries on the establishment of further industrial enterprises , connected with the creation of jobs , the municipal council decided to change the land use plan newly created in the spring of this year in sub @-@ areas .
in the area of Unter@@ zeit@@ lar@@ n the industrial area already proven in the area is extended by two plots in direction of state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
according to that , the city on the Main has the best chances to reloc@@ ate from London to jobs and companies in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt will most benefit from the Bre@@ x@@ it vote , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the I@@ W &apos;s financial markets and real estate markets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncertain whether banks should continue operating from London through financial transactions across the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the so @-@ called EU passport , the approval in the United Kingdom is enough for them so far .
that is why big US banks are using this .
several banks have already announced plans to shift jobs .
the lobby association &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; reck@@ ons with 10@@ 000 new jobs on the Main within five years .
for Frankfurt , as the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the euro@@ zone , as well as other important authorities such as the European insurance Super@@ vision E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk state ES@@ R@@ B .
while in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but this is less significant for the financial industry than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luxemburg spar@@ ed a large fund sector , but also severely under@@ min@@ ed Kerry &apos;s infrastructure in the infrastructure .
thanks to the big airport , Frankfurt is much easier to reach .
further , the city with readily available commercial properties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris it &apos;s not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the Seine River , the r@@ ents for first class commercial real estate are 50 percent higher than on the Main River .
in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure and less crime .
in a ranking of management consultancy Mer@@ cer , the city is ranked 7th , Luxembourg in number 19 , Dublin in place 33 and Paris in 3@@ 7th place .
even if quality of life is a question of preference : &quot; with its already strong position as a financial centre for the European single market , Frankfurt could attract other banks and investors , &quot; concludes the I@@ W .
but in spite of Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , London will remain the most important financial center in Europe , my econom@@ ist .
according to figures from the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba in the end of 2015 , around 14@@ 4,000 people in the banking industry were working in London , in Frankfurt they were 6@@ 2,500 .
Gilead receives legal costs from the hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
a U.S. District Ju@@ dge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to reimbur@@ sement of legal costs arising from H@@ ep@@ ati@@ ts C dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June Gilead was freed from a compensation payment of $ 200 million for the violation of two patents owned by Mer@@ ck , which were related to the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs S@@ ov@@ al@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead , after a US judge uncovered a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of Mer@@ ck , including Mein@@ ard and other un@@ ethical actions .
in the case of rising the law@@ suit on Thursday , US judge Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to the expense incurred during the defence of the case .
Mer@@ ck tries to equ@@ ate with Gilead , which controls the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medicines , which can heal more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
the case goes back to 2013 when Gilead and Mer@@ ck were mutually accused and owned by laboratory work which Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vi@@ r granted , the active ingredient in the medicines of Gilead .
troops backed by the USA say that they have reg@@ ained complete control over Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State
the US supported troops have reg@@ ained complete control over the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border , after the last IS fighters in the city have left them , a spokes@@ man of the group said on Friday .
the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) are crow@@ ding the city at the moment following the departure of the remaining group of fighters who have buried themselves within the city .
they delivered over 2,000 civilians , held ho@@ stages held by the fighters , Shar@@ eholder Dar@@ wish of the Man@@ bi@@ j military council Reu@@ ters , alli@@ ed with the D@@ KS .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city is now under complete control , but we just carry out cleaning jobs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clin@@ tons earn 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4,@@ 2 % federal taxes
H@@ illary Clinton published her tax return for 2015 on Friday , which revealed an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % for the pres@@ idency candidate of the Democrats and her husband .
in 2015 , the Clinton Foundation donated USD 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; the former Secretary of State Bill Clinton generated almost USD 5.3 million in Rede@@ hon@@ or@@ aren ; the former Secretary of State issued an income of USD 3 million from the publishing house Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for her book on her term at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
Clinton &apos;s candidate for the vice @-@ pres@@ idency , Sen@@ ator Tim ca@@ ine from Virginia , published his tax returns for the last ten years along with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton .
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; Clinton &apos;s campaign assistant J@@ enni@@ fer Pal@@ mi@@ eri announced in a statement .
in a stark contrast to this , Donald Tr@@ ump is hiding behind fake exc@@ uses and re@@ trac@@ ts in relation to his previous promises to publish his tax declar@@ ations .
it is common for U.S. Pres@@ idential candidates to publish their tax declar@@ ations , although they are not obliged by law to do so .
Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers argued for a tax investigation by tax authorities as a reason for his refusal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the move , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s election campaign assistant Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , referring to the publication of the democr@@ ats presidential candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , Tr@@ um@@ ps Special Ad@@ visor , told CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to publish something before tax inspections are not completed .
Tr@@ um@@ ps critics , including the Republi@@ can Pres@@ idential Candi@@ date of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already announced that his refusal to raise questions concerning assets , his donations for char@@ itable organisations , his business forms and various other connections , in particular with Russia .
Clinton has already over@@ thrown the issue and posted a video on the internet on Friday , asking high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tr@@ ump to publish his tax return .
she spoke on Thursday during a speech on the economy in Mich@@ igan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he refuses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and to publish his tax declar@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said in the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Poli@@ tico reported that during the 1990s , Tr@@ ump paid no or only very little taxes , and a business journalist of the New York Times quoted on Friday a number of tax lawyers and tax advis@@ ers who stated that this could still be the case .
Federal taxes have become a topic in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a scheme named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor &apos;s War@@ ren Buff@@ ett , which would ensure that individuals who earn more than USD 1 million will pay a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka last week , Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate has its headquarters here , called Tr@@ ump into a meeting to share their tax returns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Buff@@ ett said he had also been subjected to an I@@ RS tax audit and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in front of the voters and not before tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton &apos;s campaign has published tax return until 2007 .
the Clinton &apos;s , who are now living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , on average , paid an effective federal tax rate of about 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 4@@ 0.5 % .
the tax return of the 2015 Clin@@ tons showed that these USD 100 have their income as wage , unlike most Americans .
their main investment position was a cost @-@ effective index fund , from which the Clin@@ tons Divi@@ den@@ ds and earnings of USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 were tax@@ ed .

con@@ doms with Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der , fire@@ works promote dance ani@@ as Ele@@ phant protection
conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodo@@ x way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going to inhabited settlements in humans - they throw con@@ doms on them filled with chill@@ i powder .
the method has proven to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , who had already had the idea for years ago , has intensified its funding together with U.S. nature protection by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non @-@ violent four @-@ step method to protect their homes and harv@@ ests without hur@@ ting animals .
before that , many sp@@ ears have used to defend themselves .
Friday is the World Series Day dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we could observe a change in their attitude within these communities , and they are much more confident that they can stop the eleph@@ ants from their fields without har@@ ming the eleph@@ ants , &quot; said Hon@@ ey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell in a message .
the first two steps include the lighting of the elephant with a torch and the blowing in a horn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chill@@ i cloud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mix the chill@@ i powder mixed with earth together with a fire@@ work body into a con@@ dom , the end of which is turned to the ignition key .
when it is ign@@ ited , the con@@ dom is bur@@ sting with a knob and spra@@ ys fine dust of chill@@ i powder into the air .
a touch is usually already out to ch@@ ase the elephant .
one last chance represents a ship@@ pers who shoots a golden fire@@ works into the air , causing a loud , light explosion .
City Council decides unanim@@ ously : no ki@@ osk extension at the St. Go@@ ar@@ er Rhein@@ u@@ fer
the St. Go@@ ar@@ er &apos;s investment projects normally take place in K@@ us@@ sh@@ and , but the retail sector in the core city is considered to be significantly out@@ dated .
however , the municipal council now unanim@@ ously rejected the request for the construction of a sales ski facility on the banks of the Rhine in the immediate vicinity of the Rhein@@ bal@@ k@@ ons currently under construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a matter of principle , we welcome new business operators , but at this location in exposed position on the banks of the Rhine , this ki@@ osk doesn &apos;t fit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Jewish director sh@@ attered Berlin &apos;s hotel because Israeli pres@@ election was removed after &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Arab &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; request - RT News &quot; &quot; &quot;
a French director with Jewish roots captiv@@ ated a media watch after he had betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin did not list any Israeli pre @-@ election since there were Arabic guests &quot; requested &quot; according to an employee . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of Holocaust documentation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; issued his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin , writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann sought to find Israel on the country &apos;s country selection list .
however , the country was not listed among the countries which can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in the year 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel was eliminated and deleted ?
written by Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i B@@ rist@@ ol offers an opportunity to choose Israel via its own call center .
after an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception .
the answer he received there , &quot; shot him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel staff said that the measure was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel management . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason behind it spark@@ ed even more fur@@ y in the director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election is eradic@@ ated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the employee of Lanz@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Israeli ambassador to Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great dis@@ grace , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were horri@@ fied and troubled by this event .
this is really very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even greater dis@@ grace .
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident triggered a fairly large resonance in the internet , in which people called the whole a sc@@ andal .
some of them submitted to the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it would have given the alleged demands of Arab guests . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be ashamed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in another article , in which it was pointed out that the hotel , located at the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , is near a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly denied all accus@@ ations and called the incident a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; see &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct directive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to not include Israel in the quick selection list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung cited a spokes@@ man for the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it adds that the country code has now been added .
police put tear gas &amp; rubber bul@@ lets against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
students met with the police on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo when they gathered to protest against the government &apos;s reforms for the public education system .
the police launched tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against demonstr@@ ators .
the difficulties began , as police officers tried to disper@@ se the students , which led to the police inspec@@ ting rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations to express their const@@ ern@@ ation on the plans .
according to the govern@@ ors of the federal state Sao Paulo Ger@@ al@@ do Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools will be closed , while 300@@ ,000 students are implemented to save money .
some of the protest participants were seen gra@@ ff@@ iti on the provisional president Michel Tem@@ er on walls .
the latest protests took place several days after demonstr@@ ators went to the streets to support the suspended president Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been removed from office by a vote of the Senate .
trade between Russia and Iran suddenly rise to 71 % - RT Business
with the lifting of sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador to Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trade rate between Moscow and T@@ eher@@ an grew by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent .
since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , interest in Russian companies grew strongly against businesses in the country , the ambass@@ adors shared with them .
Russian companies adopt existing links with Iran while new companies are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , further commercial exploitation is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noted that the trade rate between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 rose by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the commercial boom was reached by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this year , zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan comes from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
last year , the Russian foreign agency issued some 35@@ ,000 vis@@ as , primarily travel vis@@ as , to Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries concerned with the number of tourists in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , only a few Russians visit Iran , something that the ambassador hopes it will change .
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , who have preserved the monuments of the old Persian civilization in a good state , &quot; he said .
witnesses sought : drinking market inf@@ ested in forest oil
a rob@@ ber@@ y @-@ raid was carried out on Thursday evening on the drink market of Re@@ we XXL at the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
under the support of a gun @-@ weapon , three dark dressed people , who had sil@@ enced their faces , demanded the return of cash from the staff of the beverage store and then fled first to foot and then presumably with a silver @-@ colored VW Golf .
the police did not share how much money was exploited .
the perpet@@ rators should have been between 1.@@ 60 and 1.@@ 70 metres , thus relatively small .
the beverage market is directly accessible from the parking deck of the Re@@ we market and is poorly visible .
after the attack , the perpet@@ rators must be moved towards Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and escaped from the gravel parking lot situated opposite the car park entrance , possibly towards B 256 ( Schla@@ derer @-@ Ring ) .
those who have made observations at the crime time ( against 19.@@ 45 hrs ) , who are related to the rob@@ ber@@ y , should urgently report to the police .
Nag@@ old : games and fun during summer release
eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and youth of the social ped@@ ago@@ gical day group / social group work of the child protection association Nag@@ old with their assistants on their summer release in Nuss@@ dorf , near Müh@@ lack@@ er .
in the quiet area of Hard@@ tw@@ äl@@ dle , the life @-@ joyful group was quartered during the first week of school .
several full day trips were on the agenda .
on the one hand it went to B@@ res@@ h with the visit of the pet@@ ting zoo .
on the other hand , Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special children &apos;s guide in the world famous monastery .
the third excursion led to P@@ for@@ z@@ heim .
in the Kel@@ ten@@ museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group learned a lot about everyday life and the food of the Cel@@ ts .
on the hot days , the group lived in the Tiefen@@ see in Maul@@ bron@@ n , which invited to jump , swim and sp@@ lash .
children and car@@ egi@@ vers were treated to culinary delights such as the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ ätz@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ er Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English Breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese .
in workshops it was made possible to create beautiful gem@@ s made of beads and stone or made of wood a Roman @-@ Mill game .
other highlights of the free time were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings at the fire and the final &quot; Bun@@ te E@@ ven@@ ing . &quot;
on the day of the voyage home the sun laugh@@ ed and the children and young people returned home satisfied .
Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgri@@ m to the Gates of Mer@@ cy
the altar boys from the soul care unit E@@ yach@@ ting Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the road on a four @-@ day pilgrimage from Vil@@ lingen to Freiburg .
together , four stages were completed .
in order to bridge the time up to the next pilgrimage route of all the boys in two years , the Mini@@ stries of State of St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out several days of pilgrimage .
various pilgrimage destinations have been tested and finally decided for the bishop &apos;s city of Freiburg , where a special pilgrimage destination was offered this year on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy with the opened door of Mer@@ cy on Freiburg Min@@ ster .
16 Min@@ is from B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , and Gru@@ ol , and Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and S@@ aints &apos; rooms , went their way .
in the evening before , Pastor Stor@@ z sent pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the pilgri@@ m crosses and par@@ ted the pilgrimage .
from Hor@@ b we drove by train to the starting point Vil@@ lingen , where also a Münster @-@ Un@@ ser@@ er loved woman and so the pilgrimage was started from the cathedral .
the individual tours were framed in the morning and evening depending on a short impulse with various prayers , songs and texts .
but also on the way the min@@ is on field crosses , chap@@ els or churches always rus@@ hed to sing together a song from a specially compiled pilgri@@ m song .
for the nights , the parish offices of the local par@@ ishes were available .
at the stage destination , Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller made a tasty as well as strengthening dinner and the breakfast .
on the second day we passed on Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
the day after that , one stepped up the stage to St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting stretch of road , but at the same time it had to be lowered by some 500 metres altitude and then climbed again .
the deser@@ ved reward was a common gri@@ lling on the bad@@ ger in the evening .
after the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter , it went to the final stage to Freiburg .
the min@@ is was visi@@ bly reli@@ eved and happy later in the afternoon at the Freiburg Min@@ ster and crossed the gates of mercy .
God was given thanks to a small impulse .
the min@@ is received by the operator Markus Ober@@ t were welcomed at the evening mass in Münster .
after the divine service , the pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar .
the next day was still time for the Brei@@ s@@ gau@@ metropolis .
in the afternoon we went by train back to Hor@@ b .
at the end all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked .
Scot@@ s@@ man Call@@ um Sk@@ inner stor@@ med at home when Br@@ ite Gold won gold for cycling
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner last night in the men &apos;s team spr@@ int at the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio to fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took up the role of his fellow coun@@ try@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y , who made the legend proud when he stor@@ med home to win a victory from favour@@ ites New Zealand .
England claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic med@@ als .
they repeated the trick after they took a modest sixth place in London at the World Championship in London despite the withdrawal of Ho@@ ys .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie staff .
they did so in time as a hin@@ dran@@ ce .
Ho@@ ys &apos;s retirement created a gap that Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cr@@ amp@@ ton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots that has now un@@ folded .
Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - four years ago with Ho@@ y won - and Sk@@ inner won an Olympic record in qualifying rounds , but in the standard rounds the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won in the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
h@@ ind fell short after his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it .
a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation starting in a higher gear in order to slow it down and allow Kenn@@ y and above all Sk@@ inner to keep pace .
Ho@@ y looked at his position as BBC expert and fell on Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des when they stepped onto the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am only here to do my best and make a name for myself .
we set up an Olympic Port in the final round and defeated the World Champion .
it was just incredible .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph in 2012 on the side of Kenn@@ y &apos;s and Ho@@ ys , Hin@@ des admitted that after a weak start he intentionally fell on the train .
he later with@@ drew this statement and there was no obj@@ ection from England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
with such an outstanding victory , this time there was no such problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ di said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels with the whole UK flags on the grand@@ stand like London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have come together as a team in the last three months .
we went so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympi@@ ad .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation winning seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London .
if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the past five months , we expect successful five days in the vel@@ o@@ drome .
with the form of Kenn@@ y , it is in the realm of possible that he repe@@ ats Ho@@ ys &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold med@@ als in a competition .
that would be for Kenn@@ y - who was exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on 23 March ( a apparently holy date for British sports ; on the day were also born Steve Red@@ rage , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster ) - a yield of six gold med@@ als and a silver medal .
that would be the same to that of Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y is next in the spr@@ int that starts today and will go for three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just enjoy this for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a bit lonely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two gold med@@ als , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ kilomet@@ re race .
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 .
the world record that won gold in 2012 was 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the competition , where W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on safety .
yesterday , he was cont@@ ested with officials before the qualification , when officials called him to measure his body size .
in the corresponding women &apos;s competition , which will be continued tomorrow , Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ el S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e in world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the UK team relies on his strong railway team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to bring a crowd of med@@ als .
after a truly exceptional representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio have been shut down .
there was drama in the background , so the res@@ ignation of the technical director Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April in the midst of S@@ esto and M@@ ob@@ b@@ ing@@ erie and the retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on .
however , if you look at the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks like the legendary name GB@@ s , which reached its peak at the perfect moment , will be repeated again .
future of the melting shop of Port@@ land due to the aboli@@ tion of the energy demand
the future of the aluminium mel@@ tdown of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workers &quot; work@@ places - are at stake , as the plant operator termin@@ ates the energy supply contract and thus aboli@@ sh@@ es all supply contracts , as the supplying energy company ha@@ st@@ ened .
this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no other subsidies to be allocated to the operation of the plant .
a subsi@@ dy for 20 years runs out in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the Al@@ coa plant in Port@@ land are at stake .
no fewer than 2000 work@@ places -@@ direct and indirect - could be at risk with closure .
in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effects , as the melting process consum@@ es around 10 percent of the entire power generation of Victoria .
in 2014 Al@@ coa completed the Point Henry Schmel@@ zer@@ ei , leading to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant last year .
the melting shop of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risks a closure .
this step follows the long @-@ standing speculation concerning the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last because of the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , who supplies the large aluminium melting workshop with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , told us that three further owners will termin@@ ate their contracts .
the plant is owned by a joint venture between Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ u@@ ben@@ i Cor@@ p hold smaller shares .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L expects the plant to continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means further physical demand for electricity through the melting process , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L continued to say that the contracts were so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hed@@ ging transactions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which should have come into effect as of November 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contracts have a 12 month notice period so they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , AG@@ L expects the contracts in the financial year 17 to contribute to revenues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the current supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impact on the revenue on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 is currently limited by the forecasts of the strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale electricity prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L stated that the value of the contracts had already been amor@@ ti@@ zed in its annual sl@@ ump in the amount of $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anticip@@ ation of a cancellation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the Tre@@ aties , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ab@@ ility Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the melt or to ensure the power supply to the melt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not affected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US company said that it had concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang in 2010 , which should have come into force from November this year , even if there is yet another explanation why it has withdrawn from the contract .
analysts warn of the poor economic conditions in the industry before the possible closure of Port@@ land Schmel@@ zer@@ ei in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago facility near New@@ castle .
in reference to the statements by the analysts at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land uses around 600 meg@@ a@@ watts and Tom@@ ago to consume around 900 MW of electricity per year .
if both systems disappear from the market , this would mean a considerable reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
and it wouldn &apos;t be good for us as generating sets , &quot; he said .
more than just a das@@ h of reality TV star , Kendall is on the cover of the bird issue of the Vog@@ ue
San Antonio J@@ en@@ ner , 20 , Model and the fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ en@@ ner clan , Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September issue of the US Vog@@ ue .
San Antonio , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and ran on the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on her Inst@@ ag@@ ram account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover gave me cry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the revelation of the cover followed a bizarre ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans @-@ like ? ) , a cri@@ p@@ pled reality video showing the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ en@@ ner family ( except for Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n problem cases and the presence of the most popular show bi@@ z unc@@ le and producers of Ke@@ eping Up Ry@@ an Se@@ ac@@ up ) , which ends with a classical turn : they all planned a surprise party .
this represents the c@@ lich@@ é@@ ed action almost every birthday party of a children &apos;s show ( Se@@ ac@@ re brought the sentence &quot; You thought we had forgotten you ? , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a carto@@ on on a slot at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris had to let her other girls take part in this publicity .
with regard to the September issue of the Vog@@ ue , a new era of the Car@@ das@@ hi@@ ans has begun with certainty .
Kend@@ al &apos;s big sister Kim likes it , as regards the Vog@@ ue cover ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself .
the September issue is the most sold issue of the year for Vog@@ ue .
with a circum@@ ference that resembles more of an image band than a fashion journal , the output attracts a large number of adverti@@ sers ( Accor@@ ding fashion@@ ista were adverti@@ sed by the 8@@ 32 pages of the novel 6@@ 15 pages ) .
the revelation of his cover@@ star is so eag@@ erly awa@@ ited that in the last two years images of the magazine were still le@@ aking out before the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and K@@ ate Mos@@ s .
over the last few years there were clearly more &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties that mo@@ ose &quot; as &quot; models that are celeb@@ ri@@ ties &quot; on the cover .
Oscar prize winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador J@@ enni@@ fer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013 , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honour .
but even with the small chance that Mrs. J@@ en@@ ner - described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of her generation - falls under the former category , she finds herself in good company .
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous people or reality stars or young@@ sters from today who know how to turn a good snapshot video ( even if everything is true for J@@ en@@ ner ) .
they are truly talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of her career .
of course , J@@ enny &apos;s success doesn &apos;t like everyone .
with her reality TV story J@@ enn@@ er &apos;s position in the fashion world was always ten@@ se .
in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret model Stephan@@ ie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ en@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critici@@ zed and called them &quot; the mist@@ resses of the moment . &quot;
these feelings came up again when the news came out with the show J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vog@@ ue cover .
but on the misery he seems to pass by at the point .
San Antonio J@@ en@@ ner is on the cover of the bird issue of the Vog@@ ue .
it is super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
she runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
she makes advertising for your pri@@ mer of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
she and all her sisters are selling pictures of themselves on their respective Pay@@ wall apps .
she sells her paintings by Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds &apos;s daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her free time she is in reality TV . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
municipal Centers of Community address 16@@ 0,000 people per ann@@ um
more than 16@@ 0,000 of the country &apos;s aid needs are reported annually by the municipal centres , while the industry insi@@ sts on the effects of further cuts on already over@@ loaded transactions .
in Que@@ ens@@ land three out of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for unfair del@@ o@@ gi@@ ations and similar - are rejected in their search for free legal advice and legal assistance .
legal services provided by the municipality , which are already over@@ ly utili@@ sed , are ready for further reductions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as of June next year , these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of their federal funding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the director of the District Churches of Que@@ bec James Far@@ rel@@ l said that the last survey of the National Association of Community Centr@@ es found that thousands of people are rejected each year .
Far@@ rel@@ l said the situation would only get worse without the government &apos;s resolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s community centres are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , which means that thousands of people are rejected by important services you need , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people who leave violent relations , people with un@@ man@@ a@@ geable and oppres@@ sive debt , families that go through separ@@ ations , workers who have been dismissed un@@ just - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need .
as of June 2017 , the Federal Government will cut the funds by 30 percent , which means that thousands of needy people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help .
we call on the General Prosecutor and Justice Minister and Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately raise these funds so that people can receive the help they need in legal issues .
last year , the state government was fulfilling its commitment to raise funds for legal assistance to the national average .
it is now time to look at the needs of the community centres and their client@@ ele , and that the government has invested Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k in this important work .
Donald Tr@@ ump El@@ ection Camp@@ aig@@ n accused of re@@ port@@ edly grab@@ bing weapon
new York : Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s campaign was accused of alleged in@@ action after she was told that her campaign manager for North Carolina filed a gun on an employee in February , while she was on the road in a je@@ ep in February .
the incident is described in an indictment filed on Wednesday at the State Court of Charlotte by Vincent B@@ ord@@ i , a former software programmer for the campaign in this state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ordin@@ i had been waiting for months to have maintained that the matter would be regulated internally before he realized that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would not happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the commander of the campaign , Ear@@ l Philip , drew a gun , put his right foref@@ inger on the trigger , and r@@ ammed the run into Vincent &apos;s knees , &quot; B@@ ordin@@ i stated in his indictment .
after compl@@ aining to local and regional campaign management , B@@ ord@@ i found that at least four more people had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he was charged with the indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weapons must not be fired to cause harm , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave B@@ ordin@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the prosecution only comes two days after the Republi@@ can Pres@@ idential Candi@@ date dis@@ b@@ anded a tur@@ mo@@ il when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; - fire@@ arm owners and arms friends - should take action if his rival H@@ illary Clinton was elected and judge judge .
Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s campaign clearly indicated that the media had torn his words out of context and that he would not inc@@ ite violence .
ordin@@ is Compl@@ aint demands compensation from the campaign for breach of due diligence and by Philip because of bodily injury and permanent psychological damage .
Tr@@ um@@ ps Press spokes@@ man Hope Hi@@ cks was not able to achieve an opinion .
attempts to contact Philip equally failed .
W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte , announces that Phil@@ lip is no longer a member of the campaign .

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : pol@@ l in front of country elections : losing the SPD and the CD@@ U
in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) considerable losses are notable for the SPD and CD@@ U government parties .
this resulted in representative surveys of the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
while the red @-@ black government coalition in the north could scar@@ c@@ ely go@@ vern , this is not possible according to the survey figures in Berlin .
but in both states the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances of continuing to head the head of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania , the SPD dropped from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent to 24 percent five years ago .
according to the survey , the party was only margin@@ ally short of the CD@@ U , which could come again to 23 percent .
the third place is disputed between the left and the Af@@ D .
the left would come to 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented at 19 percent for the first time in the country &apos;s parliament .
despite slight losses , the Green Party returned to the Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag despite slight losses ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) .
the N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not be represented in the parliament with 3 per cent respectively .
according to the survey , the election of the Berlin Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties only came to 23 percent ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) .
CD@@ U reached only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
it therefore remained behind the Gre@@ ens at 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but ahead of the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ D would be represented by 14 percent for the first time in the House of Dep@@ u@@ ties .
with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , while the pir@@ ates would not miss the arrival in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and Internet in slow motion : 20 years ago the Nokia Communic@@ ator came onto the market .
the success@@ ors dominate the world today - his maker experienced a disaster .
the device weigh@@ ed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was thicker and bigger , so it was not in the hand .
on the contrary , it was rather cl@@ ums@@ y .
the built @-@ in memory at the beginning was eight meg@@ ab@@ ytes , that would be enough for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution .
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigab@@ ytes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came into the stores exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 - and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a few euros , fans can still buy the devices on the internet , but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the internet age .
20 years ago , however , the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the C@@ eb@@ it computer fair in Hanover as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; office in western pocket format &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could have a lot for that standards : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax it was possible to reach Communic@@ ator .
even the access to web pages was possible via HTML browser , though tor@@ ment@@ ing slowly .
a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna and the mobile phone could be opened like a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen .
quite proud the price was : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , about 1400 euros .
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 Euro in 2015 .
nobody was able to imagine that the communic@@ ator would be the beginning of the smartphone era in August 1996 .
everything has changed since then .
smart phones are a success story , even if not for Nokia .
the Finn@@ s &quot; mobile phone line experienced an unprecedented disaster , was finally sold to Microsoft and handled .
today , the market is controlling suppliers that all came much later than Nokia .
ever and everywhere online , this is everyday for a lot of people &apos;s everyday lives .
in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide .
some 1.4 billion units sold on Samsung and Apple alone account for 5@@ 55 million units .
worldwide turnover with the equipment is around 400 billion euros .
this includes the well @-@ running shops of the countless app providers and the telecommunications companies .
in the meantime , a whole industry has emerged around the smartphone .
the decisive breakthrough on the mass market was only at the beginning of 2007 , at that time Apple CEO Steve Jobs on the Mac @-@ World announced the introduction of the iPhone .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an internet communic@@ ator , all by touch screen easy to use .
Apple &apos;s trium@@ phant success , even today , is the iPhone &apos;s most important product .
Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who dominated the market , had a look .
they finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the Sa@@ ws now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention .
on average every German now looks 88 times a day on his mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all need to learn to put the Smartphone away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina sphere , in charge of the Siemens Executive Board . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent availability is now considered a curse and a blessing at the same time .
England must direct the Olympic spirit and bro@@ aden He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London but throughout the country .
for me , this was the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ row , just like in 2012 in London , when we had a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games .
the Olympics brought great benefits to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for our local communities , we will alone already 10,000 new teachers , create 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row is too large .
I have been told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will bl@@ am@@ end on the world stage .
the doub@@ ters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ ath@@ row answers any question asked .
like the Olympic Games , He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for single one infrastructure project .
expansion is a way to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion in social growth and leave a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and throughout the UK .
we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has implemented a £ 11 billion of expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from T@@ 5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , up to T2 , which was built in the middle of the two most busy running cat@@ walks in the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the London games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that He@@ ath@@ row &apos;s expansion will also be one .
it is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and extend He@@ ath@@ row as well as to secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and jobs that England can be proud of .

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in the &quot; K@@ atz @-@ und Maus@@ Spiel &quot; regarding ad blocking
&quot; &quot; &quot; for companies who earn money with online advertising , according to a software manufacturer attempts to b@@ ypass the ad blocking , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cat and mouse game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block display block@@ ages on its desktop , Ad@@ block Plus published a blog post in which it announced that users could update their filters in the program to re @-@ block advertising on the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook announced that his desktop site would change the coding for his adver@@ ts to make it harder to detect the recognition of what part of the page advertising is .
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
in a blo@@ g@@ post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her struggle between the time @-@ locking open source community and the conver@@ ters has been underway since the invention of ad lock@@ ers , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has embark@@ ed on in the fight is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying indicators have become for the industry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a study published last year by Pa@@ w@@ air and Adobe , around 200 million people use display lock@@ ers worldwide ; almost four times as much as 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion daily active users access Facebook through their mobile devices , mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of advertising revenues .
the company has made use of ad block@@ ers on desktop PCs because mobile ad blocking has no effect on Facebook &apos;s mobile app for social networking and Inst@@ ag@@ ram , shared a spokesperson .
advertising on desktop PCs makes a sufficient share of revenues so that Facebook appears to be worthwhile to invest in such a step .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , Facebook announced that it would update its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ad preferences tool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to give people more control over their advertising . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ block would be wor@@ rying about new filters because they would block content on the page that are not advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the users this is not a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a Facebook spokes@@ man in an email communication . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad block@@ ers are a bl@@ unt means , which is why we have concentrated on developer tools like Ad Pre@@ ferences to put more control into the hands of people .
woman with presum@@ ed suicide on Swiss motorway
the victim lay in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police call witnesses after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday over@@ took a presum@@ ed suicide of several vehicles on a free@@ way .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a woman lay in the dark &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an act of despair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the streets and were hit by several cars , the police said in Vau@@ d . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is obvious that a Swiss woman at the age of 49 , who was attacked by several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself .
she died on the spot .
several drivers have already been heard , but some have not yet been identified , said the police , calling on them and every witness of the incident to report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an investigation procedure was opened , which is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; logical &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; step in such a situation , shared G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter to the Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown .
was a collision avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two similar cases over the past five years show that the drivers will not be held accoun@@ table .
in each of the two cases - where a person ran in the dark on the highway - it was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian in the middle of the night runs on the highway as it was called in the newspaper .
last year , a police officer was acqu@@ itted of the negli@@ gent killing , after killing and killing a man who was lying on the A1 near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and became unconscious in the street , took the court .
the court found that the polic@@ ew@@ oman -- who responded to a call -- found a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was an &quot; utterly unusual and unfor@@ es@@ eeable situation , &quot; said the judge .
anyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should contact the police at number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA Climate Models : Venus was once hab@@ itable
according to projections of a new NASA Climate Model , Venus was probably once hab@@ itable .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies , NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus on the basis of tools and algorithms that are similar to those of climate scientists .
the model was designed to determine whether Venus could once earth @-@ like conditions with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere .
scientists have previously pointed out that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin , earth @-@ like atmosphere and still slowly turned away .
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet probably had more dry areas than de Earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to host lives and protected from fast evap@@ oration .
the early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow rotation of Venus displays its day @-@ side of the sun for almost two months , &quot; said G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release .
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain which creates a thick layer of clouds , which works like a umbrella to shield the surface from most of the sun &apos;s heat .
the result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than that of the Earth today .
the model produced a history of Venus that resembles evolution previously thought by planetary researchers .
although it was supposedly hab@@ itable , Venus -- during the course of several billions of years --@@ was exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light .
their oceans evapor@@ ated and their steam was blown away by ultra@@ violet light .
as their hydro@@ gen sandwich only remained a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus , which we know today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy comes back as a trainer of the A@@ val@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy came back on Thursday as a coach and vice president of Ho@@ ckey Operations at the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che and led to low participation rights in the decision @-@ making process of the team .
alternative President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ son@@ ic confirmed this decision and noticed that the club is immediately searching for a new coach .
&quot; over the past three years , I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and vice president of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a statement .
in the course of the summer I thought a lot about how I could improve this team in order to give it more depth to give it more depth and to bring it to a higher level .
in order to achieve this , the vision of the coach and vice president of ho@@ ckey operations must be perfectly matched to that of the organization .
he also has to have a right to co @-@ determination in decisions affecting the team &apos;s performance .
these conditions are not currently being met .
Sak@@ son@@ ic , who had hired Roy on 23 May 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; Patrick has informed me about this decision today , &quot; he said .
we appreciate all that he has done for our organisation and wish him only the best for the future .
during his debut season Roy has won the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Award as the best coach of the league .
he led the club to 112 points and ranked first in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed the post@@ season in each of the last two years .
the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches showed a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 stamp in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the Wild for a second Wild@@ card spot at the Western Conference to five points .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart Roy won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with the Montreal Can@@ adi@@ ens and the A@@ val@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ pers again pick up talks , launch strike
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the workers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; struggles for the remuneration for North Sea workers are suspended , while all the conflic@@ ting parties sit at the table for a new round of talks , said negoti@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot;
strikes against the Oil Field Service Provi@@ ders Wood Group were spor@@ adi@@ c carried out on platforms in the North Sea run by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wood Group as well as the Un@@ ites and R@@ MT trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the resolution process of the present dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says in a common statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will review several full @-@ day sessions over the next few weeks , starting next year to restart the problems .
the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in more than 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
this year Wood Group has shortened the rates of its tractors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressures .
the company &apos;s ratings follow a 10 percent decline for on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts give the company the required space to get through the market down@@ turn .
shell has released thousands of people and announced plans to abandon their oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as it stream@@ lines its business activities as a result of its mega @-@ merger with the British energy company BG Group .
energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices , an economic situation that has intensified by the British decision in June to leave the European Union .
the Scottish parliament member Dave Anderson met with workers leaders at the beginning of this week in order to discuss one of the greatest work disputes that took place in the North Sea since a generation .
the North Sea is important for regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy that works for many and not just for a few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion will be expected for new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of some $ 7 billion in the past five years .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of stars in the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler space teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers collect the most complete catalog of rot@@ ational rates among the stars of the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades .
the new data help astronom@@ ers to understand why the stars in the star cluster rotate to different rates and in what context the rotation time periods are with the origin of the planet .
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other con@@ stell@@ ations , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of its solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Centre in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades lies 4@@ 45 light@@ years away from the earth .
many stars in this con@@ stellation , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ thood .
they are now turning the fastest .
at peak rotation rates , these mature stars meet large amounts of star@@ ches .
as these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars .
when a star age , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler att@@ aches the rotation rate of each star by recogni@@ zing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- such as sun@@ spots .
the latest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates indicates that more massive stars revol@@ ve more slowly than less massive stars .
skull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with bigger stars turning slower pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller ones .
&quot; in the P@@ lei@@ ades Ballet , we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be more massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
as the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities like rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
there is still much ahead of us what we would like to learn more about how , when and why stars slow down their rotation rates and hang up their &quot; dance shoes . &quot;
in three newspaper reports , Reb@@ ull and her colleagues have reported in detail their latest analysis of the rot@@ ational rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon be published in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eball star ki@@ cks off
tears ran faster with Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez than the US bas@@ eball @-@ star in the best days of Base zu Base .
after his emotional withdrawal , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old pro will be wearing the jer@@ sey of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es last time on 12 August .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say &apos; Goo@@ db@@ ye &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explained the 14 @-@ time all @-@ star game participant of Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three times Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was voted the most valuable player in the League , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es .
his signature at a ten @-@ year contract has been $ 27 million annually since 2007 .
until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he will act as a consultant and youth coach - with full salary .
as a player Rodri@@ gu@@ ez paid back with performance for a long time .
with 6@@ 96 hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle mar@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es he managed some mil@@ estones .
with the Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame @-@ Members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys , only two bas@@ eball players have similar values in the most important statistics .
but the 41 @-@ year @-@ old should not be included in the bas@@ eball hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because as successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - was in the field , so controversial his appearance outside the square . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2009 , the super@@ star at &quot; ES@@ PN , &quot; banned the banned ster@@ oids from 2001 to 2003 .
in August 2013 , he was closed for 211 games due to involvement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis @-@ Sk@@ ill until the end of 2014 .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered the prime suspect to have obtained benefits for years via an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
after a legal dispute , the lock was reduced to 162 meetings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the League could even have done a favor for the year 2014 , because I played it for 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez at that time sweet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also his f@@ arewell days are not smo@@ other .
while many bas@@ eball legends have once again received the big stage Rodri@@ gu@@ ez often had to sit on the bench .
&quot; my job does not include a f@@ arewell tour . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my job involves trying to win every game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ardi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and told the relations with Pop@@ star Madonna and act@@ ress K@@ ate Hudson , got sympathy for the fans of the Yan@@ ke@@ e arch@@ rival Boston Red So@@ x .
&quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od , &quot; sang the followers at 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez team .
Olympic 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Per@@ ski are the first dop@@ ing cases
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of a positive dop@@ ing test , wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ters Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland in Rio will not start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing cases .
a caught ath@@ lete would have won almost a medal .
before the seventh race day , the first official dop@@ ing cases have become known for the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter obstacle course runner Sil@@ vi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and Polish wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Per@@ in@@ sky were positively tested and excluded - immediately before the beginning of the already critical athle@@ tics competitions these news come to the end .
in Ch@@ en last Sunday the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ oth@@ i@@ azi@@ de has been proven , which is used as a mask for dop@@ ing substances .
the International Military Tribunal CA@@ S confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon local time .
on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old took fourth place in the final about 100 m Butter@@ fly , only about 0.@@ 09 seconds missed the bronze medal .
on Friday , Ch@@ en would have participated in the races over 50 m of fre@@ estyle .
the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) requested the opening of the B @-@ sample and a hearing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association takes the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very seriously and demands full cooperation in research , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said X@@ in@@ hua : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will cooperate with the International Military Tribunal CA@@ S and will accept the judgment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history it is no longer the IO@@ C , but the CA@@ S is responsible for the sanc@@ tion of athletes with positive cases .
also in the night of Rio , the news of the positive sample came to Dan@@ ek@@ ova , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went on the offensive himself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she is innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be nutritional supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ath@@ lete . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , the blood dop@@ ing agent EP@@ O should act in the forbidden substance .
Dan@@ ek@@ ova was tent@@ atively suspended , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ sample should also be positive .
Bulgarian Prime Minister Bo@@ y@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ ov immediately expressed his criticism of the ath@@ lete .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes don &apos;t draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have been excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , all wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing @-@ laden nation are not allowed to participate in Rio .
on Friday , the case &quot; Adrian Per@@ ski , &quot; the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg , was tested on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon three days earlier .
both deny the intake , but both must not start in the class up to 94 kg .
before starting the athletes , the Dan@@ ek@@ ova case is another serious blow to the reputation of the whole sport .
the World Association of IA@@ AF had banned the entire Russian team up to an exception due to systematic dop@@ ing , even the Ken@@ yan country produces many bad news in Rio .
in addition , the previous off@@ ences in China were also cat@@ ered for violent clas@@ hes among the athletes .
so the Fren@@ ch@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Y@@ ang har@@ sch .
&quot; Sun Y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ elt li@@ la . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I see the podium above 200 m of fre@@ estyle , I want to surrender , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lac@@ our@@ t said in the French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was also at the center of a debate with Australian M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing fraud , &quot; he said .
sun was positively tested by the Chinese champi@@ onships in 2014 on the stimul@@ ant tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but had to wait for only a three month lock .
Dat@@ enk@@ lau : so per@@ fi@@ de er@@ ase h@@ ack@@ ers their ran@@ som
black@@ mailing software developers are currently target@@ ing companies - and they are successful .
according to a recent survey by malware protection specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes at 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of surv@@ eyed companies in the past twelve months have at least once , partially multiple victims of an attack with black@@ mail software .
in Germany , nearly 20 percent of companies were already the target of a ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail .
40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ran@@ som required by the perpet@@ rators in order to be able to use the attacked systems and data .
according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes , the perpet@@ rators are visi@@ bly speci@@ alizing in attacks in company networks .
if they are successful there , the potentially leading ran@@ som is significantly higher than in the case of private users .
&quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying rapid evolution of the malware , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ ter@@ abyte boss Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski speaking with the &quot; world . &quot;
in 2008 , most pa@@ inters were still designed to send advertising .
then the perpet@@ rators discovered black@@ mail software for themselves .
first of all , private users were the target , but the change to company attacks happened quickly in recent months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware operates after a simple pattern : once on a victim &apos;s computer , it searches for recently changed files like Word , Excel or database files , as well as archives of images and videos .
these files encryp@@ t the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
the software then presents the recei@@ v@@ ables of the black@@ mail .
to get the end @-@ turn code to the files , the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of Cryp@@ to@@ feeding Bit@@ coin .
but where private users use the personal photo database on the game , companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases without which production stops .
the damage is correspon@@ dingly higher if a ran@@ som@@ ware hits .
22 percent of the German companies affected reported sales losses due to ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to completely inter@@ rupt their business operations , in one case people were in danger of life .
in Germany , several hospitals have already been victims of attacks whose patients can be ac@@ utely threatened by the loss of medical records .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always say to the victims : don &apos;t pay , you only promote the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay , get their data back .
it is difficult for managers to reject the perpet@@ rators in view of the down@@ time in operation .
the h@@ ack@@ ers , in turn , know this and try everything to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , the safety researchers of F @-@ Secure examined the user interfaces and contact with the black@@ mail users and come to the conclusion : the perpet@@ rators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service in order to take more money .
they tell their victims via chat how they can pay by Bit@@ coin , set free accessible support websites or dec@@ r@@ yp@@ t sample files for free .
and if private individuals are redeemed for payments of a few hundred euros , companies have to negotiate hard and pay five @-@ digit sums to get their data dec@@ r@@ yp@@ ted .
in view of the potentially high and relatively risk @-@ free gains from the ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , h@@ ack@@ ers are becoming more professional and share the work , explains security expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski of the antivirus provider Sop@@ ho@@ s : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware around within a week . &quot;
more likely , however , it is three or four people .
the programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software modular system to the actual black@@ mail .
the malware kits so far have been created by malware , counsel@@ ing and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between $ 1000 and $ 10,000 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; included is an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the black@@ mail@@ ers are looking for further h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the newly purchased software under the victims .
we live in a service economy .
so you log in one of the forums in the underground , buy the set of a criminal and instruc@@ t another to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
payment is made per infected computer .
&quot; usually the criminals employ sp@@ amm@@ ers with spreading , &quot; Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski explains .
the risk of ran@@ som@@ ware is now well @-@ known by many companies that better secure their data .
over 50 percent of the companies IT managers in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes survey trust to be able to rep@@ el ran@@ som@@ ware by file @-@ back @-@ ups and scanner software .
accordingly , the perpet@@ rators are already following new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if data encryption is no longer a sufficient threat to successful recovery , the perpet@@ rators are threatening to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing models , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ ter@@ abyte boss Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the potential for damage , depending on the type of data , is much higher than before .
in future , the perpet@@ rators will also be able to achieve completely new targets on the internet of things .
security researchers demonstrated at the Def@@ con chi@@ pper conference , how they could get a thermo@@ stat connected to the internet under their control .
in the middle of winter , the activation of such a blocked heating could certainly be worth a ran@@ som .
if the perpet@@ rators then block an entire production line in a factory , instead of heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0 .
one for all eventu@@ alities
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
in the small HR @-@ V Honda forecasts to pack everything : a little SUV , a little coup@@ é and also the versatility of a mini van .
sounds fairly over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V is rather small , the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the rear .
the materials of the interior are well @-@ finished and have a pleasant effect , only the cockpit @-@ top is falling down .
the HR @-@ V is more versatile than comparable vehicles .
there is not only a trunk of 4@@ 53 l at high @-@ level and 10@@ 26 l in reverse back@@ rests , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot;
this is less magical when it sounds : the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like a cinema armchair and thus offer storage space that is 1.@@ 24 m high from the floor up to the ceiling .
the luggage compartment can be loaded well , but the load height of 650 mm is slightly higher than that of the comparable Peugeot in 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V very power@@ fully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
he is likely to make his work somewhat qui@@ eter though .
the average daily consumption of 4.@@ 7 l / 100 km is gr@@ ati@@ fying .
there is another engine : a 1.5 liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
a four @-@ wheel drive is not available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the steering should be somewhat more direct .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the equipment in the tested top variant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leaves nothing to be desired . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the security systems include the City emergency brake assistant ( works up to speed 32 ) , the collision warning system and the lane keeping assistant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the collision alert sometimes irrit@@ ates because he ass@@ esses many obstacles as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approaching objects &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high @-@ beam assistant works very reliably .
and the intelligent speed controller respon@@ ds to the traffic sign recognition and throt@@ tles the speed as needed .
but full connectivity is available only for the top features : 7 @-@ inch touch screen , navigation device , app integration and more .
two US@@ B@@ - and one HDMI socket are under the arm@@ rest and are therefore somewhat cum@@ ber@@ some to reach .
the approximately 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine .
those who do not want to invest so much will get the petrol engine starting from 200@@ 00 Euro , the diesel from 23@@ ,000 euros .
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emissions standard .
with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday car .
airline not liable : fall on passenger bridge
an airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger &apos;s bridge .
the Düsseldorf Higher Regional Court ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) ar@@ gues that liability is conceivable only in case of danger which is typical of aviation .
the plain@@ ti@@ ff had broken a knee in the fall .
however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk of life , such as the court .
the airline did not have to pay compensation for the man .
case of illness : when does the organizer cost
holi@@ day@@ makers only get money back after their trip if the cause of the illness can be found in the hotel without a doubt .
but this is only the case if more than ten per cent of the guests have been shown to show the same symptoms .
in the case of the trial , a family was seriously ill in diar@@ rho@@ ea and vom@@ iting on the second day of its door wed@@ lock .
she spent almost the entire vacation in the room .
their illness returned the vac@@ ation@@ ers to a defective treatment plant that allegedly poll@@ uted the sea@@ water .
the family believes that the trip was lacking - and compl@@ ained against the organis@@ er .
the plain@@ ti@@ ffs were not successful in court .
the sewage treatment plant was indeed defective .
but the organis@@ er only learned about it shortly before the departure of the plain@@ ti@@ ffs .
until then , he had to assume that sea@@ water was al@@ right .
so he did not viol@@ ate his duty of information , so the judgment .
especially in the samples of water no im@@ puri@@ ties were found .
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly by infection with each other - belongs to the general risk of life .
of 6@@ 91 guests were only 38 ill .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère said , following the violent acts committed in Wu@@ erz@@ burg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people would have worried about further attacks .
the state must be so@@ ber minded and at the same time determined to react on terrorism .
it is certain that our country will not answer the violence of the perpet@@ rators with hatred and division .
we will not allow this triumph to the terrorists .
if offen@@ ders would have to leave the country faster , the security and strength will also increase the consent of the population for the refugee policy .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère aims to achieve the implementation of the proposals up to the 2017 Bundestag election .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced further personnel strengthening of the security forces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the middle four @-@ digit order of magnitude over several years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
promoting terrorism must once again be under penalty .
video surveillance is to be improved , the ar@@ senal should be revised in such a way that the purchase of weapons on the Internet is more difficult .
the last much discussed duty of sec@@ rec@@ y for doctors is to be maintained according to de Ma@@ izi@@ ère &apos;s words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , he wants to seek solutions in dialogue with the medical profession , how the threat of citizens can be reduced , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said with regard to mental ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to counter@@ act the radic@@ alization of refugees , the minister considers a better social support .
teachers should be better prepared for dealing with traumati@@ sed people .
in order to prosec@@ ute criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is planning the deployment of cover@@ t investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further increase security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important that the Interior Minister has clearly expressed himself against Action@@ ism@@ . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; that was a sla@@ p for the Schar@@ f@@ macher in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; Gabriel told the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke Media Group ( Friday ) .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère had rejected calls from the Union after a Bur@@ ka ban and the aboli@@ tion of dual nationality .
he considers a general prohibition of full @-@ wear to be constitu@@ tionally problematic .
you can &apos;t forbi@@ d everything you refuse , and I reject the wearing of the bur@@ ka .
it is possible to talk about rules about traffic or for witnesses against court .
Green leader Sim@@ one Peter accused the minister of simul@@ ating energy and action with new anti @-@ terror par@@ c@@ els .
&quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ party Chief Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a fleet of pro@@ verb@@ s and a tigh@@ tening of the right of residence bring people in this country no longer security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better traffic on the motorway feeder
it st@@ alls regularly on the b@@ ypass road - here is a picture of November .
but this shall change : the rule of law shall be extended .
this is good news for all car drivers who are in traffic on the ambient road every evening in traffic jam when they drive over the free@@ way to Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
the road construction is extended on Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between the hammer street and the exit Wes@@ eler Straße the right turn track by 700 meters .
drivers can then travel directly from the hammer road to the right .
the major advantage is that traffic is increasing early , which improves the overall flow rate on the busy section of the road 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the District of Münster @-@ West .
the road con@@ stric@@ tion on the feeder nerves the drivers especially between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
on week@@ days , the return section extends up to the bridge across the Alber@@ slo@@ e way and sometimes beyond .
the reason is the con@@ i@@ fer@@ ous needle on the B 51 just before the exit Wes@@ eler Straße .
from here , traffic is only driven one lane by the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be built back almost three quarters of years ago .
the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer possesses the required load capacity to absorb heavy load traffic in two lanes .
the competent national company cannot say how long this bott@@ len@@ eck and the associated work traffic jam is going to last .
however , it has to be expected for years : because the bridge has an official residual service life of the year 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the rule of law , the national company deliberately chose the weaker time during the school holidays because it is difficult to calculate with disabilities .
the traffic is passed on Tuesday and Wednesday once a lane at the construction site .
intercultural Travel : cultural Activities for Schools
&quot; &quot; &quot; the international class of the Wald@@ schule visited the play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Das Un@@ seen Haus &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association N@@ ima &apos;s and the Junge Theater are planning a music project .
N@@ ima &apos;s association enables young people with migration background and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Class International &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule children &apos;s house has visited an idea of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The invisible house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the boy theatre Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; initiated by the association N@@ ima &apos;s , 19 students from eleven to 15 years visited the st@@ aging in the small house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims at cultural integration of young people with migration background and refugee background , offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Mu@@ enster within the framework of this project .
most of the young people in the class came to Mu@@ enster between September 2015 and March 2016 , among others , from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria , and speak little German .
thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic images and video animations , it was possible for them to follow the course of action , thus the press release of the boy theatre Münster .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az West@@ er@@ berg from Spra@@ kel , and the young theatre will work together in the upcoming season as part of a music theatre project .
between October and December young people with and without an immigration and migration background will have the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing , dance , acting and music .
offers for children and families in the field of theatre play and theat@@ rical communicating are in the planning .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; continues .
in view of the increased number of refugees , the association expects many classes to participate .
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for improvement of weather
the weather turned the star @-@ sn@@ u@@ ff Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the south @-@ west of Germany on Friday a stroke by the bill - but there is still hope .
the night was bad for clouds and rain to watch the spectacle of heaven , said the chairman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning .
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather should be good , then we see many shooting stars in the sky .
the star@@ ch@@ ets are Per@@ sei@@ ds , which are one of the fastest shooting stars with 2@@ 16@@ ,000 kilometers per hour .
they have their name because they seem to come from the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us coming up in the north @-@ east .
relaxing Night : tips for sleeping disorders
in the evening , you roll around forever , at night you lie awake for hours , in the morning is already far from the wake of the wake @-@ up ring@@ ing no more to think of sleep .
this is anything but relaxing .
after all , one is in good company with such problems : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of the adults sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing .
how do sleep problems or sleep disorders express themselves ?
there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there can be many reasons behind them , emphas@@ ising Hans @-@ Günter We@@ ed@@ dy , member of the board of the German Society for Dre@@ ams and S@@ leep Medicine .
what one understands for the time being , however , is the In@@ som@@ nia , that is , an inhal@@ ation and a breakdown @-@ disorder .
as a result many people feel inadequate or inadequate , says Jens Wagen@@ kne@@ cht , member of the board at the German Medical Association with Practice in Lower Saxony .
what is behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
behind it can be organic , psychological or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also medicines .
in@@ frequently , sleep disorder is an expression of another disorder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early awakening is often a lot of depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ zu . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that different factors condition each other .
for example , if you have a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , every two or three hours will wake up and possibly start to think about everyday problems and worries , there &apos;s an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should I sleep with a doctor ?
anyone who does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week should go to the doctor , advises We@@ ed@@ dy .
the impairment can look quite different : you are beaten , tired , sleep@@ y , has difficulties with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical ail@@ ments like stomach or head@@ aches .
to allevi@@ ate sleep disorders , it is important to find out their causes .
treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or even medication - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in@@ quired .
Dr. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary sleeping medical centre at the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin , hardly exists in Germany .
this is why you should first contact your family doctor when it comes to sleeping problems .
this can be clari@@ fied by examining whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to the sleep lab and what will happen ?
for example , in the sleep laboratory doctors recommend snor@@ ing with breathing rash , in case of illness of the day , for sleep@@ wal@@ kers or if one does not find the cause of a breakdown distur@@ b@@ ance , explains Fi@@ etze .
one does not really need to prepare for the investigation .
you should spend the day normally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just don &apos;t take a n@@ ap , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the cl@@ adding one goes to bed at its normal time .
in addition to the electrodes on the body , you wear a nose clip , a chest strap and a sensor on your finger .
a camera on the ceiling also records the sleeping .
how can suffer@@ ers get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a lot of adjusting screws that can be used for a better sleep .
it all counts : regular sleeping and standing times , not too long in bed , do not sleep on the day , do not watch TV for falling asleep , avoid drinking alcohol and don &apos;t look at the watch at night - then you start to count immediately , and that is quite and not condu@@ ci@@ ve .
what the jungle camp has to have with missing med@@ als in swimming
the former German S@@ wimm@@ ers Markus Dei@@ bler commented on Facebook to dis@@ appoint the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 he first took gold at the World Cup in Doh@@ a and at the same time set up his first world record .
now the former DS@@ V ath@@ lete Markus Dei@@ bler has placed himself in front of his ex @-@ team @-@ mates via Facebook .
&quot; in a country where an Olympic champion gets 20.000 € bonus and a jungle King 15@@ 0,000 € should not be surprised about missing med@@ als , &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote in the night on Friday on his Facebook page .
the conveyor system in swimming is bad , whereas dop@@ ing controls are very good .
in this way , we cannot compete with countries that promote a great deal and do not look closely at the issue of dop@@ ing , or even operate it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls should be set up here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , Dei@@ ties had to be reported nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency in Germany ( NA@@ DA ) .
this is exactly how you should keep it with countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you can &apos;t control a certain time before WM / OS by independent controllers of WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the election @-@ ham@@ burger , who meanwhile operates an ice cream shop . &quot; &quot; &quot;
airport : Ban@@ de of luggage thi@@ eves arrested
professional thi@@ eves at Düsseldorf Airport
on Thursday , the police of the Düsseldorf police managed to capture two women and two men aged 50 to 61 years old .
the susp@@ ects had committed several pocket and baggage theft as a gang .
at 21.@@ 30 , civilian officials in the area of the Dus@@ sel@@ dorf airport recognized a gang that was known to the police from past theft charges .
the two women and two men had committed several off@@ ences since the middle of July and were very professional in doing so .
the specialists of the Criminal Police Act 34 can demonstrate four actions specifically for crimes committed in Germany .
they had a total of more than 15,000 Euros .
old buildings , a few lime trees , in between a rest of cob@@ ble@@ stones : the Riga @-@ Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain street in Riga does not look like this , but the police counts it to the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
if one goes along the road from east to west , one passes play@@ grounds , a fres@@ her kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; someone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spra@@ yed on the façade of a grey house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
compared to a Li@@ dl , which is to be demoli@@ shed in the near future , a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here by 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; articles about this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trendy district &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as known as the responsible property company Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain , are preferred over the last few weeks with burning cars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents have rental contracts , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , especially the inner sen@@ ator of Berlin had spoken out several times for a tough action by the police against the project , the area referred to as &quot; no @-@ go zone &quot; for police and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence .
after having cleared the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , with 300 police officers , the police pat@@ rolled three weeks of official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site , locked up parts of the street and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94 .
in the meantime , construction workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown land@@ lords .
on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court decided that the clearance had been illegal , and a day later , police and construction workers followed the che@@ ering of sympath@@ is@@ ers and residents .
on this summer afternoon the road works peac@@ efully : parents walk with children , people sit on the pav@@ ement in front of the houses in the sun , others talk about the sp@@ ä@@ ti .
in the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens .
lef@@ tist violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in Kie@@ z since 1999 , and Jan@@ a * , who covers three children here , are especially anno@@ yed by the police presence .
they share the fear of increasing r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication with the inhabitants of the house projects .
it does not sound like a Kie@@ z , who mostly wanted police protection from the v@@ and@@ ali@@ zing left .
the tren@@ ch , which the Berlin interior sen@@ ator and the police force between house occup@@ iers and their neighbours , obviously does not exist .
Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working class neighborhood which , compared to the rest of the city , has a low average age and a high risk of poverty .
house @-@ occup@@ ations and the residential projects that are born from it have long been part of the Kie@@ z : in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former G@@ DR , including almost the entire Main@@ zer Straße in the vicinity of the Riga .
while the Main@@ zer had been cleared in a regular street battle , many of the projects in the Riga were leg@@ alized and are still inhabited by the people whom they had occupied 26 years ago .
at the same time , the district has become a magnet for tourists and election ber@@ liners from all over the world in recent years : people from the G@@ DR times and former occup@@ ants now share their Kie@@ z .
this is also noticeable in the r@@ ents , which have risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009 .
many of the new buildings in the Riga are being attacked as symbols for this development : they can be seen on broken pan@@ es or freshly painted facades , which were spra@@ yed with paint bags .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no other street was mentioned this year as often as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; left autonomous violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one reason that not all neighbours see this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crimes such as assault are based on statistics almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
the most important part of the off@@ ences make occasional damage , which tends to meet the newly built houses and newly renovated houses .
for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a rental house next to the controversial 94 , there can be no talk of uncertainty .
as for violence , it is appe@@ asing : the people in the 94 are their neighbors , they are not destined to be .
even the famous burning cars are no longer in the ri@@ gs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the studied architecture , her street is not a criminal point , on the contrary : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here you help each other , live together on the street and get more of each other than elsewhere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer has been deliberately drawn into the Riga road - and remained .
that is why it was also so important for the residents to get back their streets : from the police , politics and the media , which suddenly claimed the interpretation sovereignty over the neighbourhood in July .
but in the eyes of residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road continues to be taken away : through fac@@ eless new buildings in former construction gaps that disp@@ lace the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are , ultimately , con@@ domini@@ ums that are not interesting for many here - people who are not so busy live here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I absolutely can &apos;t appro@@ ve violence and destruction . &quot;
but what to do if you never listen to someone ?
there is fru@@ stration on all sides , even with the police and the inhabitants .
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding for those drawn on colour bombs . the house projects and the left scene belonged to the Kie@@ z .
who draws near should be aware of it - just like someone who pul@@ ls into a pub area , can complain about noise there .
all persons introduced with first names have asked not to be called by their proper name .
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new refugee officer
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person in terms of integration and organizer .
she is also a social worker .
since July Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the Om@@ bud@@ s@@ man for Ur@@ bach .
the social educ@@ ator supports the team of administration around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
it sees itself as a contact for all actors : refugees , working groups refugee assistance , administration , authorities and who else is involved .
Reg@@ ine client from the working group suggests that the honorary officials are more than grateful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is there , the hus@@ band@@ ry Woll@@ mil@@ ch@@ sau , who has above all a problem .
some - less ridi@@ cu@@ le than on the large number of desired areas - meant that the administration wanted to write the job .
a management expert was sought out with a talent for languages and people , combined with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , just as a so@@ ber@@ ing wool @-@ mil@@ ch@@ sau .
but administrative work is not their central area , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le writes .
above all , it is about organizing , working with people on site and also behind the scenes as well as networking activity .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has limited a 50 percent position on three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was high time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine client , that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports honest and full @-@ time actors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are large and small problems , organizational , human and communication problems .
soon new containers in the Was@@ en@@ straße
a serious problem has been to find homes for the connecting refugees who have been recognized .
municipalities are responsible for connecting the connection .
they have to accommodate the refugees in their own or hired residential premises .
the costs for the construction , the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must carry the municipalities themselves .
responsibility changes from the coun@@ cill@@ or to the commun@@ e and job centre .
problem : there are free objects , but not every owner wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been very difficult for some time now .
de facto , the administration does not find private apartments .
so far , it does not work so far as to be dependent on private dwell@@ ings , so Deu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , common apartments must be not@@ orious as it is so beautiful .
so soon new containers are set up in the Was@@ en@@ straße .
but only with apartments it is not done .
outlook is the keyword , Reg@@ ine Client and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree .
in addition to a permanent residence , there are intern@@ ships , apprentices@@ hips , school grounds , one @-@ euro jobs and employment activities for refugees and migrants who need to be und@@ one or set up .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; says Reg@@ ine client .
many work in the yard or help master craftsmen , do char@@ itable work - and that &apos;s motivated and very ti@@ dy , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
she hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect .
this is &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
but this activity does not only mean work .
the day needs a solid structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and the customer .
people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
so I need offers like sports , contacts with locals and above all language courses .
professional courses are rare .
so the administration and the volunteers are also jumping here .
it is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
they have to explain to the refugees that it is just and they can spend time wis@@ ely , for example with language courses .
whoever develops the feeling that he can &apos;t help anyone in Ur@@ bach , may not work and be un@@ profitable , he will never be integrated .
the clear majority is motivated .
but there are problems , says customer , &quot; people with nothing at all . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and client is therefore always motiv@@ ating others .
all this is already a &quot; mamm@@ oth task . &quot;
a difficult question : have the two fears of radic@@ alisation after the recent happ@@ enings , also in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ine client says quite clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what some nai@@ ve might call . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a residual risk could and may not exclude them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
these incidents are also subject to refugees .
they were afraid that the attacks put them completely in demand .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine client .
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
in other words , local and honorary officials have to look for activities on the spot and in the region .
they always have in mind that soon a new push to refugees and migrants might come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need an upper limit ?
to answer this question clearly , the policy is afraid .
actually it is unfair to place them on site .
&quot; we haven &apos;t arrived in Ur@@ bach where we want to go , &quot; Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le says .
no new refugees , that would relax the situation .
Reg@@ ine &apos;s client also makes it clear that the cre@@ ators are already used to integrate the existing human beings in a reasonable way .
these are currently around 100 persons , mainly young men .
but when people are in need , they must help them , both women agree .
the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers .
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : bur@@ gl@@ ar wanted with helicopter
